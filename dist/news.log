That proposal was widely seen as favouring Russia. The Kremlin will want to know what changes have been made to the draft in Geneva.</p><p>The suspicion here in Moscow is that the updated version will not be as favourable to Russia. This morning the Russian tabloid Mosovsky Komsomolets wrote: “The European and Ukrainian gang will 'correct' Trump’s plan in such a way that it becomes completely unacceptable for Russia.”</p><p>Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov says Ukrainians would \"fight to the end\" to save the Donbas territories from coming under Russian control.</p><p>As we've been reporting, Donald Trump's 28-point plan says Kyiv's troops must withdraw from parts of the Donetsk region they currently control, which would then be recognised internationally as under Russian control.</p><p>Chernov tells the BBC's Global Story podcast: \"We should ask Ukrainians what they think about it.\"</p><p>He describes the regions under discussion in peace talks as \"places of my childhood\".</p><p>\"Maybe for the sake of saving lives there will be some sort of agreement, but I know the bitterness of that.\"</p><p>\"It's burnt and it's my home,\" he adds. \"Ukraine is not only the land, Ukraine is a community or community of communities. So as long as that idea survives, Ukraine will survive.\"</p><p>Chernov won an Academy Award in 2024 for his documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, which documented the Russian siege of the city at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Here are some pictures of the aftermath in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, where four people have died after Russian attacks.</p><p>\"Every night and every day are new challenges for our city, new destruction and new work for all services that have been continuously saving people,\" the city's Mayor Ihor Terekhov writes following the strikes.</p><p>We've just heard from US President Donald Trump about the weekend's peace talks in Geneva.</p><p>\"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he writes in a social media post.</p><p>Laura GozziEurope reporter</p><p>Earlier today, Zelensky said a major issue was that Putin wanted \"legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty\" - a reference to Russia's repeated demand that Ukrainian troops withdraw from several embattled eastern regions.</p><p>With this, Zelensky is making the point that allowing Russia to seize land by force would set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>International law recognises Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its occupation of several other regions directly challenged this principle - and the idea that a peace settlement could reward Moscow for its aggression is unacceptable, Zelensky says.</p><p>The US peace plan draft proposes to freeze the front line in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, giving Moscow control of huge areas of those regions. Perhaps more concerningly for Ukraine, it also says Kyiv should hand over the areas of the industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Russia.</p><p>Zelensky has repeatedly said that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future - not to mention the thousands of casualties Ukraine has suffered, and is still suffering, trying to protect the region.</p><p>It would be very difficult for Zelensky to justify the loss of the Donbas to Ukrainians.</p><p>Following Volodymyr Zelensky's address to Sweden, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says Ukraine will not accept legal recognition of the Russian-occupied territories, restrictions on Ukraine's forces, or limits on Ukraine's future alliances.</p><p>Ruslan Stefanchuk describes these as rules that \"no-one can violate\" in the peace negotiations.</p><p>He also tells the Swedish parliament that Ukraine's membership of the EU and Nato must be part of any peace plan.</p><p>As we've reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been addressing the Swedish parliament.</p><p>He says the \"main problem\" facing the peace talks is Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory he has \"stolen\" from Ukraine.</p><p>\"This would break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he tells the lawmakers, and insists that \"borders cannot be changed by force\".</p><p>\"Keep pressure on Russia. Russia is still killing people,\" he finishes by saying.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the Swedish parliament after talks in Geneva</p><p>Nick BeakeEurope correspondent</p><p>US (left) and Ukrainian delegations met in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday</p><p>European countries have been struggling to project a persuasive voice in what is a US-led process.</p><p>EU leaders are currently meeting African leaders in Angola, which may well reinforce the sense of them being far removed from the negotiations.</p><p>President Macron of France warned over the weekend that Russia could invade Ukraine again if the Zelensky government is pushed into reducing the size of its military.</p><p>Chancellor Merz of Germany said he had stressed to President Trump in a phone call the severe consequences for the whole of Europe if Ukraine were to collapse following defeat in the war.</p><p>But it is hard to tell if these words are having any impact.</p><p>Ukraine is certainly hoping the personal relationships of certain European leaders with Trump will benefit them in a process that appears to have favoured Russia from the outset.</p><p>Trump-whisperer and golf partner President Stubb of Finland has tweeted this morning about “major issues” needing to be resolved, and said he had been in touch with Zelensky.</p><p>But he also had a message to the US and to the man with whom he has often strode down the fairway together – that EU and Nato members would take “a separate track” to discuss matters affecting them directly.</p><p>In other words, America and Russia would not dictate their future.</p><p>The Kremlin says it hasn't received an updated peace plan following the weekend's talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva.</p><p>Speaking this morning, Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov says Vladimir Putin's administration has been following the discussions and understands that \"some adjustments\" have been made to the peace plans Russia had previously received.</p><p>But he adds: \"So far, we have not received anything officially.\"</p><p>Peskov also says there are no plans for Russian talks with a US delegation about Ukraine this week.</p><p>Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent in Geneva</p><p>We understand that the talks in Geneva are over after an intense day of diplomacy on Sunday, with all the key negotiators leaving town.</p><p>Marco Rubio left last night and the Ukrainian delegation has also returned to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian state media who were covering the talks. The UK security adviser Jonathan Powell has now gone, diplomats here say.</p><p>Yesterday, Marco Rubio made clear that the push for a peace proposal - a \"living, breathing document\" as he called it - was a process that had been in the works for three weeks prior to the high level talks, and would continue away from Geneva.</p><p>“We have all kinds of people on technical levels working full time on this,” Rubio told the press before flying out of Switzerland last night. “There are a handful of technical items that we expect answers from on or suggestions in the next 24 hours or so. So this is an ongoing process.”</p><p>The US idea was to get the big names round the same table on Sunday to try to “iron out” some issues and the US secretary of state said they had made “great strides”.</p><p>Those involved will now report back to their respective presidents.</p><p>What are media outlets in Russia saying about Donald Trump's latest push to end the war in Ukraine?</p><p>The BBC's Russia editor Steve Roseberg has been looking through the morning papers to find out.</p><p>He notes there's significant scepticism that this round of diplomacy will bring results - and there's also a lot of finger pointing at Kyiv and Europe.</p><p>A former MI6 chief has praised this weekend’s peace talks as a “good approach”, but says the initial proposals were just Moscow talking points.</p><p>Alex Younger, who led MI6 from 2014 to 2020, tells the BBC that the original proposals - which asked Kyiv to cut its military by the thousands and commit to not joining Nato - would have left Ukraine “a tethered goat” after Russia created a weakness it would later exploit.</p><p>If Ukraine had agreed to this straight away, Younger tells the Today programme, “the war would restart”.</p><p>He says the idea that Ukraine’s army should be so limited it can’t defend itself is an “absolute non-starter”.</p><p>Instead, Younger says the only security guarantee that matters is Ukraine having a powerful, well-equipped army able to defend itself - the “porcupine strategy”.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just addressed the Swedish parliament via video link.</p><p>He says this is \"a critical moment\", and Ukraine is working \"closely with the US and other European partners to define steps\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty. That's the main problem. You all understand what that means,\" he says.</p><p>Putin wants this \"not only from Ukraine, he wants it from the whole world, and it's very dangerous.\"</p><p>Zelensky adds that during the talks so far, they've managed to keep \"very sensitive points\" on the table, including the release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children.</p><p>But he says there's more to do, and calls for decisions on the use of frozen Russian assets.</p><p>\"The aggressor must pay fully for the war he started,\" Zelensky tells the parliament.</p><p>Hungary's foreign minister Péter Szijjártó urges European leaders to support the 28-point plan, which he says is a \"major chance\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Every European politician has a duty to support this plan fully and unconditionally, as this is the rational and humane choice,\" he says.</p><p>He criticises any Western European leader trying to \"block\" the plan.</p><p>Hungary has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has used Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to maintain good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform to win re-election next April in Hungary by promising \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.</p><p>Alexander Stubb visited Donald Trump at the White House in October</p><p>Finland's president Alexander Stubb says he welcomes the progress made in the talks in Geneva, after speaking to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>\"The negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\" he adds.</p><p>Stubb adds any decision falling within the remit of the EU or Nato will be discussed and decided by their members separately.</p><p>Last week, details of a 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine emerged.</p><p>The White House says the plan - discussed by the US and Ukraine in Geneva over the weekend - has been endorsed by President Donald Trump after being drawn up by his officials.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also insists the framework was \"authored by the US\", though accepts it had been \"based on input from the Russian side\".</p><p>That’s after a group of US senators said Rubio told them that the plan was not an American proposal - that it represented the Russian position and was leaked by Moscow.</p><p>European leaders expressed unease at the 28-point plan, saying it was too favourable to Russia, and stressed it would \"require additional work\".</p><p>The BBC has not yet seen the document in full - but here’s a rundown on five things we know were in the initial plan:</p><p>It's important to remember, though, that the initial plan is being negotiated, and could change significantly.</p><p>The US says that \"based on the revisions and clarifications presented\" in Geneva, the Ukrainians \"believe the current draft reflects their national interests and provides credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term\". We are yet to see those revisions and clarifications.</p><p>US President Donald Trump met Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, in August</p><p>A former US ambassador to Ukraine has urged Western leaders to put more pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>William B Taylor says Putin is trying to \"wait out\" Ukraine, Europe and the United States, in order to secure a favourable deal for Russia.</p><p>\"If we hang tough then we can force him to come to the table, but we haven't done that,\" he tells Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p>Taylor adds that the \"Putin problem is one President Trump didn't truly appreciate\" until now.</p><p>A former UK ambassador to Russia has warned that reaching agreement on \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine is likely to prove difficult.</p><p>The initial 28-point peace plan said there would be Western-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, in order to deter future Russian aggression.</p><p>But the plan also required Ukraine to commit to not joining Nato - the military alliance of Western nations. It's unclear whether this requirement still remains in place, after German foreign minister Johann Wadephul suggested it had been removed.</p><p>The UK's former ambassador to Russia, Sir Tony Brenton, says he’s heard that one of the \"principal complications\" continues to be around those security guarantees for Ukraine.</p><p>\"The Russians are very suspicious of any sort of guarantee which will amount in their view to Ukraine joining Nato by the back door,\" he explains.</p><p>As we've been reporting, the White House insists that Ukrainian officials believe the draft peace plan \"provides credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security\".</p><p>The talks between the US and Ukraine in Geneva have produced \"decisive success\" for Europeans, says the German foreign minister.</p><p>Johann Wadephul says issues concerning Europe, including an apparent ban on Ukraine joining Nato, have been removed from the 28-point peace plan.</p><p>\"This is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,\" he tells Germany's public-broadcasting radio station, Deutschlandfunk.</p><p>The German foreign minister also reiterated that \"any agreement must not be reached over the heads of\nEuropeans and Ukrainians\".</p><p>As a reminder, we have yet to see the 28-point plan in full - or the \"revisions and clarifications\" that were, according to the US, agreed on Sunday.</p><p>A joint US-Ukraine statement said both sides \"agreed to continue intensive work on joint proposals in the coming days\"</p><p>Overnight, the White House said talks with Ukraine on a peace deal with Russia were \"extensive and productive\".</p><p>In a statement, the US administration said Ukraine’s officials recognised that \"all of their principal concerns\" - including security guarantees and political sovereignty - had been \"thoroughly addressed\" during the meeting.</p><p>The statement said there had been \"revisions and clarifications\" to the initial 28-point plan.</p><p>\"They [Ukrainian officials] believe the current draft reflects their national interests and provides credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term,\" the US said.</p><p>\"Both sides welcomed the steady progress made and agreed to continue consultations as the agreements move toward final refinement.\"</p><p>The White House statement followed remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told reporters \"tremendous progress\" had been made on reaching a peace deal.</p><p>Copyright © 2025 BBC.

Others require higher-level decisions and consultations. Others, I think, just need more time to work through.”</p><p>The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the US to end the nearly four-year Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine has sparked alarm in Kyiv and European capitals.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the US support it so desperately relies on. Zelenskyy also asserted that Ukrainians “will always defend” their home.</p><p>The proposal accommodates many Russian demands that Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including ceding large territories.</p><p>In a statement released on Sunday night after the talks, the White House said the Ukrainian delegation “affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting.”</p><p>It added that Kyiv “expressed appreciation for the structured approach taken to incorporate their feedback into each component of the emerging settlement framework.” The White House said changes made to the proposal now reflect “their national interests\" and provide \"credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term.”</p><p></p><p>But the language of such positive steps came only after concerns about the original, Trump-endorsed deal intensified.</p><p>A bipartisan group of US senators said Rubio told them Saturday that the plan had originated with Russia and was actually a “wish list” for Moscow, rather than a serious push for peace.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he’d spoken to Trump and made clear there were some parts of the plans key European nations could agree on, but others where they could not.</p><p>“I told him that we are fully in line with Ukraine, that the sovereignty of this country must not be jeopardised,” Merz said in an interview with a German media outlet.</p><p>Rubio called the US proposal a “living breathing document” that would continue changing. He also made clear that any final product, once it’s ready, will still have to be presented to Moscow; “obviously, the Russians get a vote here.”</p><p></p><p>The positive assessment of what was discussed defied Trump himself. Before talks began, the president blasted Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for US military assistance while shying away from criticising Russia.</p><p>“Ukraine 'leadership' has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts, and Europe cotinues to by oil from Russia,” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, on Sunday morning.</p><p>After Trump’s post, Zelenskyy cheered US-led efforts on security while also stressing that “the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.”</p><p>“Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on Telegram, adding, “We thank everyone in Europe.”</p><p>“It is important not to forget the main goal – to stop Russia’s war and prevent it from ever igniting again,” he added.</p><p>Additional sources • AP</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"US and Ukraine make progress in Geneva talks to end Russia's invasion","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/24/us-and-ukrainian-delegations-report-progress-on-ending-russian-invasion-after-talks-in-gen","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24 05:10:36 +01:00"}

{"details":"<p>Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.</p><p>The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.</p><p>Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\".</p><p>Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".</p><p>But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".</p><p>This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.</p><p>The US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia.</p><p>Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.</p><p>\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"</p><p>Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.</p><p>Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.</p><p>Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it.</p><p>Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\".</p><p>\"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.</p><p>The US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.</p><p>Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.</p><p>Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.</p><p>Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".</p><p>Ukraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.</p><p>The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.</p><p>But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\".</p><p>\"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"</p><p>But staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"</p><p>However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.</p><p>The US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p>But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p>It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p>Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p>The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>A submarine expert says he is \"confident\" the recovered object is an imploded Russian sonobuoy.</p><p>Aishat Baimuradova fled her home this year in the hope of living the way she wanted, but she was then found dead in her rented flat.</p><p>US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.</p><p>\"I didn't get the life I wanted... I was forced to move to a different country,\" says Kvitka, 14.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>The European Commission is planning to boost the use of biofuels to cut emissions in heavy industry transport as part of its revamp of the upcoming bioeconomy strategy, according to a leaked document seen by Euronews.</p><p>Aviation and maritime remain the 'Achilles heel' of decarbonisation under the EU27's energy and climate transition goals. The sectors remain highly reliant on fossil fuels and account for around 8.4% of the EU's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to EU data.</p><p>Despite ongoing EU investments to develop clean power, sustainable fuels for heavy transport aren't available on scale. The EU executive is proposing to boost the use of crops and trees for biofuel production in a bid to slash GHG emissions.</p><p>\"Demand is expected to rise from 2025\", mainly driven by ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime,\" reads the document, referring to the bloc's laws designed to increase the uptake of renewable fuels in heavy transport.</p><p>Environmental groups have long criticised the use of biofuels as unsustainable, arguing that it could jeopardise food security and the ability of forests to trap CO2 from the atmosphere.</p><p>Biofuels are categorised by source, with each category known as a “generation.”</p><p>First-generation biofuels are derived from food crops like corn and sugarcane, second-generation biofuels are derived from inedible vegetation and agricultural waste, and third-generation biofuels are derived from algae.</p><p>However, the block is far from having the capacity to produce enough biofuels.</p><p>A 2023 audit from the European Court of Auditors found that sustainability issues, biomass availability and costs are limiting the deployment of biofuels. It also noted that the lack of a long-term perspective in EU biofuels policy has affected investment.</p><p>According to a recent report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), Europe’s resource use of nature-based materials exceeds the domestic capacity of ecosystems to regenerate green resources and absorb CO2.</p><p>In 2022, biomass use for energy in Europe accounted for 29%, the leaked document stated, noting that this figure has increased by 14% over the past 10 years.</p><p>A recent trade deal on agriculture signed between the EU and Ukraine could fulfil the bloc's demand for biofuels.</p><p>Kyiv's vast agricultural land size of 41.3 million hectares — 68.5% of Ukraine's total land — of which 32.7 million hectares were arable land, according to 2024 research from the European Parliament.</p><p>The new deal includes safeguards limiting imports of certain sensitive products such as grains and oil. If these a lifted, Ukraine could end up playing a key role in the supply chain.</p><p>The Commission will announce on Tuesday the third review of the bioeconomy since its launch in 2012. It is meant to support goals like food security, climate action and competitiveness.</p><p>The sector has generated up to €2.7 trillion in 2023, according to the document, up from the €812 billion in 2022.</p><p>\"The EU’s bioeconomy is a dynamic driver for competitiveness and is of strategic importance,\" read the document.</p><p>However, international competition, notably from the United States and China, and persistent barriers in the single market are slowing deployment and risk diverting innovation to non-EU markets, according to the document.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"EU executive touts increase of biofuels uptake for aviation, maritime","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/24/exclusive-european-commission-touts-increase-of-biofuels-to-clean-up-heavy-transport","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24 12:10:54 +01:00"}

That proposal was widely seen as favouring Russia. The Kremlin will want to know what changes have been made to the draft in Geneva.</p><p>The suspicion here in Moscow is that the updated version will not be as favourable to Russia. This morning the Russian tabloid Mosovsky Komsomolets wrote: “The European and Ukrainian gang will 'correct' Trump’s plan in such a way that it becomes completely unacceptable for Russia.”</p><p>Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov says Ukrainians would \"fight to the end\" to save the Donbas territories from coming under Russian control.</p><p>As we've been reporting, Donald Trump's 28-point plan says Kyiv's troops must withdraw from parts of the Donetsk region they currently control, which would then be recognised internationally as under Russian control.</p><p>Chernov tells the BBC's Global Story podcast: \"We should ask Ukrainians what they think about it.\"</p><p>He describes the regions under discussion in peace talks as \"places of my childhood\".</p><p>\"Maybe for the sake of saving lives there will be some sort of agreement, but I know the bitterness of that.\"</p><p>\"It's burnt and it's my home,\" he adds. \"Ukraine is not only the land, Ukraine is a community or community of communities. So as long as that idea survives, Ukraine will survive.\"</p><p>Chernov won an Academy Award in 2024 for his documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, which documented the Russian siege of the city at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Here are some pictures of the aftermath in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, where four people have died after Russian attacks.</p><p>\"Every night and every day are new challenges for our city, new destruction and new work for all services that have been continuously saving people,\" the city's Mayor Ihor Terekhov writes following the strikes.</p><p>We've just heard from US President Donald Trump about the weekend's peace talks in Geneva.</p><p>\"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he writes in a social media post.</p><p>Laura GozziEurope reporter</p><p>Earlier today, Zelensky said a major issue was that Putin wanted \"legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty\" - a reference to Russia's repeated demand that Ukrainian troops withdraw from several embattled eastern regions.</p><p>With this, Zelensky is making the point that allowing Russia to seize land by force would set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>International law recognises Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its occupation of several other regions directly challenged this principle - and the idea that a peace settlement could reward Moscow for its aggression is unacceptable, Zelensky says.</p><p>The US peace plan draft proposes to freeze the front line in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, giving Moscow control of huge areas of those regions. Perhaps more concerningly for Ukraine, it also says Kyiv should hand over the areas of the industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Russia.</p><p>Zelensky has repeatedly said that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future - not to mention the thousands of casualties Ukraine has suffered, and is still suffering, trying to protect the region.</p><p>It would be very difficult for Zelensky to justify the loss of the Donbas to Ukrainians.</p><p>Following Volodymyr Zelensky's address to Sweden, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says Ukraine will not accept legal recognition of the Russian-occupied territories, restrictions on Ukraine's forces, or limits on Ukraine's future alliances.</p><p>Ruslan Stefanchuk describes these as rules that \"no-one can violate\" in the peace negotiations.</p><p>He also tells the Swedish parliament that Ukraine's membership of the EU and Nato must be part of any peace plan.</p><p>As we've reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been addressing the Swedish parliament.</p><p>He says the \"main problem\" facing the peace talks is Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory he has \"stolen\" from Ukraine.</p><p>\"This would break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he tells the lawmakers, and insists that \"borders cannot be changed by force\".</p><p>\"Keep pressure on Russia. Russia is still killing people,\" he finishes by saying.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the Swedish parliament after talks in Geneva</p><p>Nick BeakeEurope correspondent</p><p>US (left) and Ukrainian delegations met in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday</p><p>European countries have been struggling to project a persuasive voice in what is a US-led process.</p><p>EU leaders are currently meeting African leaders in Angola, which may well reinforce the sense of them being far removed from the negotiations.</p><p>President Macron of France warned over the weekend that Russia could invade Ukraine again if the Zelensky government is pushed into reducing the size of its military.</p><p>Chancellor Merz of Germany said he had stressed to President Trump in a phone call the severe consequences for the whole of Europe if Ukraine were to collapse following defeat in the war.</p><p>But it is hard to tell if these words are having any impact.</p><p>Ukraine is certainly hoping the personal relationships of certain European leaders with Trump will benefit them in a process that appears to have favoured Russia from the outset.</p><p>Trump-whisperer and golf partner President Stubb of Finland has tweeted this morning about “major issues” needing to be resolved, and said he had been in touch with Zelensky.</p><p>But he also had a message to the US and to the man with whom he has often strode down the fairway together – that EU and Nato members would take “a separate track” to discuss matters affecting them directly.</p><p>In other words, America and Russia would not dictate their future.</p><p>The Kremlin says it hasn't received an updated peace plan following the weekend's talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva.</p><p>Speaking this morning, Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov says Vladimir Putin's administration has been following the discussions and understands that \"some adjustments\" have been made to the peace plans Russia had previously received.</p><p>But he adds: \"So far, we have not received anything officially.\"</p><p>Peskov also says there are no plans for Russian talks with a US delegation about Ukraine this week.</p><p>Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent in Geneva</p><p>We understand that the talks in Geneva are over after an intense day of diplomacy on Sunday, with all the key negotiators leaving town.</p><p>Marco Rubio left last night and the Ukrainian delegation has also returned to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian state media who were covering the talks. The UK security adviser Jonathan Powell has now gone, diplomats here say.</p><p>Yesterday, Marco Rubio made clear that the push for a peace proposal - a \"living, breathing document\" as he called it - was a process that had been in the works for three weeks prior to the high level talks, and would continue away from Geneva.</p><p>“We have all kinds of people on technical levels working full time on this,” Rubio told the press before flying out of Switzerland last night. “There are a handful of technical items that we expect answers from on or suggestions in the next 24 hours or so. So this is an ongoing process.”</p><p>The US idea was to get the big names round the same table on Sunday to try to “iron out” some issues and the US secretary of state said they had made “great strides”.</p><p>Those involved will now report back to their respective presidents.</p><p>What are media outlets in Russia saying about Donald Trump's latest push to end the war in Ukraine?</p><p>The BBC's Russia editor Steve Roseberg has been looking through the morning papers to find out.</p><p>He notes there's significant scepticism that this round of diplomacy will bring results - and there's also a lot of finger pointing at Kyiv and Europe.</p><p>A former MI6 chief has praised this weekend’s peace talks as a “good approach”, but says the initial proposals were just Moscow talking points.</p><p>Alex Younger, who led MI6 from 2014 to 2020, tells the BBC that the original proposals - which asked Kyiv to cut its military by the thousands and commit to not joining Nato - would have left Ukraine “a tethered goat” after Russia created a weakness it would later exploit.</p><p>If Ukraine had agreed to this straight away, Younger tells the Today programme, “the war would restart”.</p><p>He says the idea that Ukraine’s army should be so limited it can’t defend itself is an “absolute non-starter”.</p><p>Instead, Younger says the only security guarantee that matters is Ukraine having a powerful, well-equipped army able to defend itself - the “porcupine strategy”.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just addressed the Swedish parliament via video link.</p><p>He says this is \"a critical moment\", and Ukraine is working \"closely with the US and other European partners to define steps\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty. That's the main problem. You all understand what that means,\" he says.</p><p>Putin wants this \"not only from Ukraine, he wants it from the whole world, and it's very dangerous.\"</p><p>Zelensky adds that during the talks so far, they've managed to keep \"very sensitive points\" on the table, including the release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children.</p><p>But he says there's more to do, and calls for decisions on the use of frozen Russian assets.</p><p>\"The aggressor must pay fully for the war he started,\" Zelensky tells the parliament.</p><p>Hungary's foreign minister Péter Szijjártó urges European leaders to support the 28-point plan, which he says is a \"major chance\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Every European politician has a duty to support this plan fully and unconditionally, as this is the rational and humane choice,\" he says.</p><p>He criticises any Western European leader trying to \"block\" the plan.</p><p>Hungary has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has used Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to maintain good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform to win re-election next April in Hungary by promising \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.</p><p>Alexander Stubb visited Donald Trump at the White House in October</p><p>Finland's president Alexander Stubb says he welcomes the progress made in the talks in Geneva, after speaking to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>\"The negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\" he adds.</p><p>Stubb adds any decision falling within the remit of the EU or Nato will be discussed and decided by their members separately.</p><p>Last week, details of a 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine emerged.</p><p>The White House says the plan - discussed by the US and Ukraine in Geneva over the weekend - has been endorsed by President Donald Trump after being drawn up by his officials.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also insists the framework was \"authored by the US\", though accepts it had been \"based on input from the Russian side\".</p><p>That’s after a group of US senators said Rubio told them that the plan was not an American proposal - that it represented the Russian position and was leaked by Moscow.</p><p>European leaders expressed unease at the 28-point plan, saying it was too favourable to Russia, and stressed it would \"require additional work\".</p><p>The BBC has not yet seen the document in full - but here’s a rundown on five things we know were in the initial plan:</p><p>It's important to remember, though, that the initial plan is being negotiated, and could change significantly.</p><p>The US says that \"based on the revisions and clarifications presented\" in Geneva, the Ukrainians \"believe the current draft reflects their national interests and provides credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term\". We are yet to see those revisions and clarifications.</p><p>US President Donald Trump met Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, in August</p><p>A former US ambassador to Ukraine has urged Western leaders to put more pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>William B Taylor says Putin is trying to \"wait out\" Ukraine, Europe and the United States, in order to secure a favourable deal for Russia.</p><p>\"If we hang tough then we can force him to come to the table, but we haven't done that,\" he tells Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p>Taylor adds that the \"Putin problem is one President Trump didn't truly appreciate\" until now.</p><p>A former UK ambassador to Russia has warned that reaching agreement on \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine is likely to prove difficult.</p><p>The initial 28-point peace plan said there would be Western-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, in order to deter future Russian aggression.</p><p>But the plan also required Ukraine to commit to not joining Nato - the military alliance of Western nations. It's unclear whether this requirement still remains in place, after German foreign minister Johann Wadephul suggested it had been removed.</p><p>The UK's former ambassador to Russia, Sir Tony Brenton, says he’s heard that one of the \"principal complications\" continues to be around those security guarantees for Ukraine.</p><p>\"The Russians are very suspicious of any sort of guarantee which will amount in their view to Ukraine joining Nato by the back door,\" he explains.</p><p>As we've been reporting, the White House insists that Ukrainian officials believe the draft peace plan \"provides credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security\".</p><p>The talks between the US and Ukraine in Geneva have produced \"decisive success\" for Europeans, says the German foreign minister.</p><p>Johann Wadephul says issues concerning Europe, including an apparent ban on Ukraine joining Nato, have been removed from the 28-point peace plan.</p><p>\"This is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,\" he tells Germany's public-broadcasting radio station, Deutschlandfunk.</p><p>The German foreign minister also reiterated that \"any agreement must not be reached over the heads of\nEuropeans and Ukrainians\".</p><p>As a reminder, we have yet to see the 28-point plan in full - or the \"revisions and clarifications\" that were, according to the US, agreed on Sunday.</p><p>A joint US-Ukraine statement said both sides \"agreed to continue intensive work on joint proposals in the coming days\"</p><p>Overnight, the White House said talks with Ukraine on a peace deal with Russia were \"extensive and productive\".</p><p>In a statement, the US administration said Ukraine’s officials recognised that \"all of their principal concerns\" - including security guarantees and political sovereignty - had been \"thoroughly addressed\" during the meeting.</p><p>The statement said there had been \"revisions and clarifications\" to the initial 28-point plan.</p><p>\"They [Ukrainian officials] believe the current draft reflects their national interests and provides credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term,\" the US said.</p><p>\"Both sides welcomed the steady progress made and agreed to continue consultations as the agreements move toward final refinement.\"</p><p>The White House statement followed remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told reporters \"tremendous progress\" had been made on reaching a peace deal.</p><p>Copyright © 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.</p><p>The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.</p><p>Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\".</p><p>Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".</p><p>But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".</p><p>This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.</p><p>The US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia.</p><p>Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.</p><p>\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"</p><p>Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.</p><p>Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.</p><p>Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it.</p><p>Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\".</p><p>\"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.</p><p>The US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.</p><p>Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.</p><p>Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.</p><p>Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".</p><p>Ukraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.</p><p>The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.</p><p>But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\".</p><p>\"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"</p><p>But staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"</p><p>However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.</p><p>The US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p>But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p>It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p>Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p>The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>A submarine expert says he is \"confident\" the recovered object is an imploded Russian sonobuoy.</p><p>Aishat Baimuradova fled her home this year in the hope of living the way she wanted, but she was then found dead in her rented flat.</p><p>US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.</p><p>\"I didn't get the life I wanted... I was forced to move to a different country,\" says Kvitka, 14.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

{"details":"<p>A three-year-old boy has astounded doctors with his progress after becoming the first person in the world with his devastating disease to receive a ground-breaking gene therapy.</p><p>Oliver Chu has a rare, inherited condition called Hunter syndrome - or MPSII - which causes progressive damage to the body and brain.</p><p>In the most severe cases, patients with the disease usually die before the age of 20. The effects are sometimes described as a type of childhood dementia.</p><p>Due to a faulty gene, before the treatment Oliver was unable to produce an enzyme crucial for keeping cells healthy.</p><p>In a world first, medical staff in Manchester have tried to halt the disease by altering Oliver's cells using gene therapy.</p><p>Prof Simon Jones, who is co-leading the trial tells the BBC: \"I've been waiting 20 years to see a boy like Ollie doing as well as he is, and it's just so exciting.\"</p><p>At the centre of this remarkable story is Oliver - the first of five boys around the world to receive the treatment - and the Chu family, from California, who have put their faith in the medical team at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</p><p>A year after starting the treatment, Oliver now appears to be developing normally.</p><p>\"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing,\" says his mother Jingru.</p><p>The BBC has followed Oliver's story for more than a year - including how scientists in the UK first developed the pioneering gene therapy and how the medical trial they are conducting almost didn't get off the ground due to lack of funds.</p><p>We first meet Oliver and his dad Ricky in December 2024 at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. It's a big day.</p><p>Since being diagnosed with Hunter syndrome in April,  Oliver's life - like that of his elder brother, Skyler, who also has the condition - has been dominated by hospital visits.</p><p>Skyler had shown some late development in speech and coordination, but this had initially been put down to being born during Covid.</p><p>Ricky tells me his sons' diagnosis came as a complete shock.</p><p>\"When you find out about Hunter syndrome, the first thing the doctor tells you is 'Don't go on the internet and look it up because you'll find the worst cases and you'll be very, very disheartened'.\"</p><p>\"But, like anybody, you look it up and you're like, 'Oh my goodness, is this what's going to happen to both my sons?'\"</p><p>Children are born apparently healthy, but around the age of two they start to show symptoms of the disease.</p><p>These vary and can include changes to physical features, stiffness of the limbs and short stature.  It can cause damage throughout the body, including to the heart, liver, bones and joints and in the most serious cases can lead to severe mental impairment and progressive neurological decline.</p><p>Hunter syndrome almost always occurs in boys. It's extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 male births in the world.</p><p>Until now, the only medicine available for Hunter syndrome was Elaprase, which costs around £300,000 per patient, per year and can slow the physical effects of the disease. The drug is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and so does not help with cognitive symptoms.</p><p>But today, Oliver is being hooked up to a machine and having some of his cells removed - the first crucial step in trying to halt his genetic disorder in this one-off treatment.</p><p>\"His blood is being passed through a fancy machine that is collecting a specific type of cell called stem cells which will be sent to a lab to be modified and then given back to him,\" Dr Claire Horgan, consultant paediatric haematologist explains.</p><p>Oliver's cells are carefully packaged and sent to a laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London.</p><p>In Hunter syndrome, a genetic error means that cells are missing the instructions for making an enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), essential for breaking down large sugar molecules which over time accumulate in tissues and organs.</p><p>Scientists insert the missing IDS gene into a virus, which has its genetic material removed so that it can't cause disease.</p><p>A similar method has been used in other gene therapies, such as the treatment for another rare inherited condition, MLD.</p><p>Dr Karen Buckland, from the Cell and Gene Therapy Service at GOSH, explains: \"We use the machinery from the virus to insert a working copy of the faulty gene into each of the stem cells.</p><p>\"When those go back to Oliver, they should repopulate his bone marrow and start to produce new white blood cells and each of these will hopefully start to produce the missing protein [enzyme] in his body.\"</p><p>There still remains the issue of how to get enough of the missing enzyme into the brain.</p><p>To overcome this, the inserted gene is modified so that the enzyme it produces crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently.</p><p>We next meet Oliver back at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</p><p>This time he's with his mum Jingru, while Ricky has stayed in California to look after Skyler.</p><p>There is a sense of anticipation as a member of the research team opens a large metal cryopreservation tank where Oliver's gene edited stem cells are frozen, having been transported back from GOSH.</p><p>A small, clear infusion bag is removed and slowly brought to body temperature in a tray of liquid.</p><p>After multiple checks, a nurse draws the clear fluid containing around 125 million gene-modified stem cells, into a syringe.</p><p>Oliver is used to hospitals, but is fretful, and wriggles as the research nurse slowly injects the treatment, about a cup full, into a catheter in his chest.</p><p>Jingru holds Oliver steady in her arms. After 10 minutes, the infusion is done.</p><p>An hour later, a second, identical infusion is made. Oliver continues to watch cartoons on a portable screen, oblivious to the potential importance of what's just happened.</p><p>And that's it. The gene therapy is complete. It seems to be all over rather quickly, yet the ambition here is huge: to stop Oliver's progressive disease in its tracks, in a one-off treatment.</p><p>After a couple of days, Oliver and Jingru fly back to California. Now the family, and the medical team must wait to see if the gene therapy has worked.</p><p>In May, Oliver is back in Manchester for crucial tests to see if the gene therapy is working. This time the whole family is here.</p><p>We meet in a park in central Manchester and it's immediately clear that things are looking good.</p><p>Oliver is more mobile and inquisitive than I've seen him. Admittedly, he now has the freedom to play and is out of hospital, but he appears brighter and healthier.</p><p>Ricky is thrilled: \"He's doing really well. We have seen him progressing in his speech, and mobility. In just three months he has matured.\"</p><p>The really big news is that Oliver has been able to come off the weekly infusion of the missing enzyme.</p><p>\"I want to pinch myself every time I tell people that Oliver is making his own enzymes,\" says Jingru. \"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing.\"</p><p>She tells me he is \"so different\" from before the treatment, is talking \"a ton\" and is engaging more with other children.</p><p>It is lovely to finally meet five-year-old Skyler who is very protective and caring towards his younger brother.</p><p>\"My wish upon the star is for Skyler, to be able to get the same treatment,\" says Ricky. \"It feels like Oliver has got a reset in his life, and I want the same thing for Skyler, even though he's a bit older.\"</p><p>Initially it was thought that Oliver was too old for the trial, as the treatment cannot reverse existing damage, but tests showed he was still largely unaffected.</p><p>Skyler seems to take delight in the world around him, and is keen to hold my hand and chat as we walk to the park.</p><p>Ricky explains that Skyler has delayed development in speech and motor skills, but is undergoing infusion therapy, which gets the treatment to his body, but not his brain.</p><p>Oliver returns to Manchester every three months for a few days of follow-up tests.</p><p>In late August, further checks confirm the gene therapy is working.</p><p>Oliver is clearly thriving, and to date is now nine months post treatment.</p><p>Prof Jones, whom Oliver calls Santa because of his white beard, is beaming: \"Before the transplant Ollie didn't make any enzyme at all and now he's making hundreds of times the normal amount.</p><p>\"But more importantly, we can see he's improving, he's learning, he's got new words and new skills and he's moving around much more easily.\"</p><p>However, Prof Jones exercises a degree of caution: \"We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time.\"</p><p>On the rooftop garden at the hospital, Oliver plays with his dad.</p><p>\"He's like a completely different child. He's running around everywhere, he won't stop talking,\" says Ricky.</p><p>\"The future for Ollie seems very bright and hopefully this means more kids will get the treatment.\"</p><p>In all, five boys have been signed up for the trial, from the US, Europe and Australia.  None are from the UK as patients here were diagnosed too late to qualify.</p><p>All the boys will be monitored for at least two years. If the trial is deemed a success, the hospital and university hope to partner with another biotech firm in order to get the treatment licensed.</p><p>Prof Jones says the same gene therapy approach is being applied to other gene disorders.</p><p>There are similar treatments on trial in Manchester for MPS type 1 or Hurler syndrome and MPS type 3 or Sanfilippo syndrome.</p><p>Ricky and Jingru say they are \"eternally grateful\" to the Manchester team for allowing Oliver to join the trial.</p><p>They say they are astonished by his progress in recent months.</p><p>Oliver's now producing the missing enzyme and his body and brain are healthy.</p><p>\"I don't want to jinx it, but I feel like it's gone very, very well,\" says Ricky.</p><p>\"His life is no longer dominated by needles and hospital visits. His speech, agility and cognitive development have all got dramatically better.</p><p>\"It's not just a slow, gradual curve as he gets older, it has shot up exponentially since the transplant.\"</p><p>Researchers at the University of Manchester led by Prof Brian Bigger had spent more than 15 years working on creating the gene therapy for Hunter syndrome.</p><p>In 2020 the university announced a partnership with a small US biotech company Avrobio, to conduct a clinical trial.</p><p>But three years later the company handed back the licence to the university, following poor results from another gene therapy study and a lack of funds.</p><p>The first-in-human trial, which would soon help Oliver, was in jeopardy before it had even begun.</p><p>Prof Jones: \"We had to move very quickly to try to save the whole idea and find another sponsor and another source of funding.\"</p><p>It was then that British medical research charity, LifeArc, stepped in, providing £2.5m of funding.</p><p>CEO Dr Sam Barrell said: \"A huge challenge for the more than 3.5 million people in the UK living with rare conditions, is getting access to effective treatments – currently 95% of conditions have none. \"</p><p>The Chu family are relieved the trial didn't come to a halt and now hope Skyler may one day benefit from the same gene therapy as his brother.</p><p>\"I would walk to the end of the earth, backwards, forwards, upside down, barefoot, to make sure my kids have a better future,\" says Ricky.</p><p>Additional reporting Nat Wright and Brijesh Patel</p><p>Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.</p><p>Toddler Oliver and his dad Ricky join Jon and Sally on the Breakfast sofa, to discuss his progress after his ground-breaking gene therapy.</p><p>One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime.</p><p>The vehicle will contain an X-ray machine and radiographer and will travel to patients who fall.</p><p>Smokefree Sunderland is aiming to cut the city's smoking rate to 5% by 2030 but more work is needed.</p><p>Much like our other organs, our skin begins to age from the moment we are born.

{"details":"<p>With many families left traumatised by killings apparently linked to supposed  magic rituals in Sierra Leone, BBC Africa Eye looks into those behind the trade in human body parts.</p><p>Warning: This article contains details some readers may find disturbing.</p><p>The mother of an 11-year-old boy murdered as part of a suspected black magic killing four years ago is devastated that no-one has yet been brought to justice for his death.</p><p>\"Today I'm in pain. They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.</p><p>He had gone out to sell fish at the market and never came back.</p><p>His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.</p><p>\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.</p><p>This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.</p><p>In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.</p><p>They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.</p><p>But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.</p><p>Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.</p><p>But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.</p><p>Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p>Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.</p><p>One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.</p><p>We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.</p><p>Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.</p><p>\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.</p><p>Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions.</p><p>On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.</p><p>\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"</p><p>He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"</p><p>When Osman specified that he wanted limbs from a woman to be used in a ritual, Kanu got down to business: \"The price of a woman is 70m leones [£2,500; $3,000].\"</p><p>Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.</p><p>Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.</p><p>World Health Organization data shows that Sierra Leone - which suffered a brutal civil war in the 1990s and was at the centre of the Ebola epidemic a decade ago - had around 1,000 registered doctors in 2022, compared to reported estimates of 45,000 traditional healers.</p><p>Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.</p><p>Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.</p><p>\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.</p><p>Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.</p><p>It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.</p><p>\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"</p><p>The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.</p><p>\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a researcher at the UK's Aberystwyth University, told the BBC.</p><p>\"Some are misclassified or misreported as accidents, deaths resulting from attacks by wild animals, suicides, natural deaths… Most perpetrators - possibly 90% - are not apprehended.\"</p><p>When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.</p><p>\"I'm not alone, I have up to 250 herbalists working under my banner,\" the man calling himself Idara told Osman, who was again undercover and wearing a secret camera.</p><p>\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.</p><p>He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.</p><p>Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.</p><p>He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.</p><p>\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.</p><p>He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"</p><p>After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.</p><p>This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.</p><p>As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.</p><p>There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.</p><p>The case was referred in August 2023 by a magistrate to the High Court for trial, but two sources have told the BBC it has not been pursued so far and those detained by police have been released on bail.</p><p>My family is facing similar hurdles finding justice. In May, during our BBC investigation, my 28-year-old cousin Fatmata Conteh was murdered in Makeni.</p><p>A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.</p><p>Several of her front teeth were missing, leading the community to believe it was a ritual killing.</p><p>\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.</p><p>We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.</p><p>As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.</p><p>Additional reporting by Chris Alcock and Luis Barrucho</p><p>Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.</p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica</p><p>The Gambian government says it is hosting Tchiroma Bakary on humanitarian grounds.</p><p>The raid on a Christian school came amid a surge of attacks by armed groups in the African nation.</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there is a \"renewed commitment to multilateral co-operation\".</p><p>The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups in the African nation.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Bollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".</p><p>Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.</p><p>Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.</p><p>Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.</p><p>Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.</p><p>Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".</p><p>Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".</p><p>Born on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.</p><p>\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"</p><p>But when he told his family, they were appalled.</p><p>\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"</p><p>But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.</p><p>Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.</p><p>He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.</p><p>In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.</p><p>Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.</p><p>Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.</p><p>Over the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.</p><p>The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra. In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".</p><p>Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.</p><p>The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.</p><p>The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.</p><p>Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"</p><p>He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.</p><p>In his lifetime, the actor gave many fine performances, but if there's one role that he'll always be remembered for, it'll be that of Veeru in Sholay - the 1975 blockbuster that has become a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>The multi-starrer that also had Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles saw Dharmendra and Bachchan play loveable rogues-turned-saviours who are recruited to fight a dreaded bandit.</p><p>The film became a cult classic and many fans credited Dharmendra for its success, describing him as the \"soul of Sholay\". The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.</p><p>But despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.</p><p>It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.</p><p>But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.</p><p>\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.</p><p>\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.</p><p>On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.</p><p>\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"</p><p>Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".</p><p>The veteran Indian actor, often called a 'Greek God', has died. Watch this excerpt from his 2018 interview.</p><p>India defeated Nepal by seven wickets in the final played in Sri Lankan capital Colombo on Sunday.</p><p>Some worry about the gaps in their official documents, others are concerned the move could affect their access to welfare schemes.</p><p>India face an uphill battle if they are to avoid another home Test series defeat after South Africa hit 489 on day two of the second Test in Guwahati.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

The school has not commented on that allegation.</p><p>The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.</p><p>The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.</p><p>On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state.</p><p>And on Saturday, 14 young farmers in the mainly Muslim Borno state were abducted.

{"details":"<p>Thea Jaffe never expected to use a baby bank. In fact, she was responsible for referring other single parents from her local community group to the charity Little Village, which provides essential supplies for new parents who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford them – everything from strollers and cots to clothes, diapers, toys and books.</p><p>But when Jaffe, who lives in London, became pregnant unexpectedly with her second child, she couldn’t afford to buy everything she needed. “It’s so overwhelming having to accommodate a baby with no budget,” she told CNN.</p><p>“I was already struggling financially… but I didn’t know how bad things were going to get… Now things are at a point where I’m working full time, and I cannot pay my bills.”</p><p>Child poverty has reached a record high in the United Kingdom as the country’s cost of living soars and its social security safety net falters following years of government austerity. With public services much weakened, charities like Little Village have stepped in.</p><p>The issue is firmly under the spotlight this week as campaign groups call on Britain’s Labour government to prioritize measures to reduce child poverty in its annual budget, which will be unveiled on Wednesday.</p><p>Around one-third of Britain’s children – about 4.5 million – now live in relative poverty, often measured as living in a household that earns below 60% of the national median income after housing costs, a government report published in April found.</p><p>One million of these children are destitute, going without their most basic needs of staying warm, dry, clothed and fed being met, according to a 2023 study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which studies poverty and formulates policy to tackle it.</p><p>“We came across one family that were just existing on cornflakes and rice,” Little Village chief executive Sophie Livingstone told CNN.</p><p>“We have lots of families who are in one room, lots of mold, lots of very poor-quality housing even when people are housed,” she added.</p><p>Even for families that are able to meet their children’s basic needs, life is a month-to-month struggle, without any financial security.</p><p>“You just live in fear all the time and that’s not a fun place to be when you’ve got children relying on you,” Lia, a single mother to 7-year-old twin girls, told CNN after being connected through the Changing Realities Project, which documents parents living on low incomes. She asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family’s privacy.</p><p>“They want to do all the same things that their peers are doing… but the budget won’t allow that,” she said. After paying for essentials each month, she has no money left.</p><p>“Every single time I go out, I have to vigilantly and diligently make sure I’m not overspending. That’s a really anxiety-provoking situation to be in.”</p><p>A law graduate who lives in Hampshire, southeast England, Lia initially returned to work but says she would often be called mid-meeting by her childcare provider if one of her daughters, who has complex needs, dyspraxia and global developmental delay, was having a “tantrum or a meltdown.” She eventually had to quit her job.</p><p>“I go into survival mode,” she said. “I was in the (foster) care system growing up and I remember feeling so much struggle and angst like, ‘if I can just get through this, it’ll be ok.’ Yet still, that situation hasn’t changed; as much as I know I have a lot to offer and I try to be a good member of society, I still feel like no matter where I turn, there’s difficulty.”</p><p>And even for families earning well above the poverty line, the cost of housing and childcare, especially in London, can be so high that there is simply no money to spend on anything else. Around 70% of children living in poverty have at least one parent in work.</p><p>Childcare is more expensive in the UK than in most other wealthy countries – costing about 25% of a couple’s and about 60% of a single parent’s net household income, according to figures released by think tank The Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2022.</p><p>Jaffe, the mother who makes use of the Little Village baby bank, works full-time in client solutions and says she earns £45,000 ($59,000) a year to support herself and her three children – well above the UK’s average. Still, she says she is “struggling every month to make sure everything is paid, not able to save anything, not able to do things for my kids.”</p><p>After paying for essentials – rent, childcare, food and household bills – she is left with £192 (around $250) a month for emergencies and to save for the next month in case there’s an error in her next social security payment – something she says is a regular occurrence.</p><p>Although child poverty has always been present in the UK, the rate of it is rising – and much faster than in other wealthy countries. Between 2012 and 2021, it rose by almost 20%, UNICEF found. Now, in 2025, the UK’s child poverty rate is higher than that of any European Union country except Greece, according to the Resolution Foundation, a living standards think tank.</p><p>The organization estimates that another 300,000 children will fall into poverty by 2030 if nothing changes.</p><p>The current poverty rate reflects inequalities present elsewhere in society, too. Almost half of children in Black and Asian communities are living in poverty, compared with 24% of White children, while children living in single-parent families or in families where someone is disabled are also more likely to live in poverty, figures from campaign organization the Child Poverty Action Group show.</p><p>Part of this rise is down to the same economic conditions afflicting other parts of the Western world – sluggish growth, and employment no longer offering the same financial security, as well as stubborn inflation that disproportionately affects essential goods and, therefore, people on low incomes.</p><p>But academics and advocates say policy decisions have also played a part. Britain’s public services were slashed by the center-right Conservative-led coalition and subsequent Conservative government in power from 2010 to 2024.</p><p>And as part of its austerity program, which aimed to reduce public spending in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Conservatives introduced three policies that “are very largely responsible for the increase in child poverty today,” said Jonathan Bradshaw, an emeritus professor of social policy at the University of York who also served as one of the academic advisers to the current government’s upcoming child poverty strategy.</p><p>These limited the amount of welfare people are eligible to claim – one is an overall cap on the benefits a household can receive, another limits housing benefits and the third is a two-child benefit cap, meaning that parents cannot claim anything for their third or subsequent children born after 2017.</p><p>Charities and academics say it is this two-child benefit cap in particular that is largely responsible for Britain’s rising rates of child poverty.</p><p>“Most of the increase in child poverty has occurred in large families,” Bradshaw told CNN.</p><p>All this demonstrates the “inadequacy of the benefits system,” says Peter Matejic, chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p><p>“If you tot up how much you need for food, energy, all these things, and look at how much (benefits are)… it’s below that level,” he told CNN.</p><p>When UN envoys Philip Alston and Olivier De Schutter visited the UK in 2018 and 2023, respectively, they both condemned the poverty they saw there, though De Schutter noted that the country conformed to a pattern of increasing inequality seen in other wealthy countries.</p><p>A spokesperson for the current Labour government, which has been in power since July last year, told CNN that “every child, no matter their background, deserves the best start in life.”</p><p>“We are investing £500 million in children’s development through the rollout of Best Start Family Hubs, extending free school meals and ensuring the poorest don’t go hungry in the holidays through a new £1 billion crisis support package.”</p><p>Addressing child poverty has been a stated priority for the center-left government and, at the same time, an issue that illuminates the fault lines within it.</p><p>Ever since Labour came to power, it has grappled with balancing the mandate for change on which it was elected, and its traditional inclination to invest in public services, with scant available funds and a manifesto pledge not to increase taxes on working people.</p><p>Its plans to reduce child poverty have thus far been stymied by this conundrum. More details of the government’s spending and tax plans are due to be unveiled Wednesday, in which Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the UK’s finance minister, is expected to address the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government has oscillated between keeping and scrapping for the past year.</p><p>But for parents already on the breadline, their household budgets have been stretched too thin, for too long.</p><p>“People have got no resilience left,” says Livingstone, remembering that when she first began her role as the head of Little Village “we were talking about the safety net having lots of holes in it.”</p><p>“I’m actually not sure that there is much of a safety net anymore,” she says.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

He has stepped down from his post but strongly denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The archipelago nation of some 7,641 islands is extremely prone to flooding, with residents of poor communities saying the corruption scandal has left them without protection.</p><p>More than 250 people were killed as two super typhoons slammed into the Philippines within a week of each other earlier this month.</p><p>Experts say island nations like the Philippines are facing increasingly severe and frequent tropical storms due to warming oceans and other effects of climate change, and that more flood control efforts are needed to minimise the potential consequences.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Philippine President Marcos says seven arrested over corruption scandal","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/philippine-president-marcos-says-seven-detained-over-corruption-scandal","message":"","updatedAt":"24 Nov 2025"}

{"details":"<p>The Trump administration could have expanded authority to take action in Venezuela starting Monday, as the US designates Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization.</p><p>The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions targeting Maduro’s assets and infrastructure. It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts.</p><p>Still, administration officials have been making the case that the designation — one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism tools — will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.</p><p>Cartel de los Soles is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, experts say. The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel, which some experts suggest technically doesn’t exist in a conventional sense.</p><p>The designation, announced November 16, comes as the US military has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon has branded “Operation Southern Spear.” The US military has killed dozens of people in boat strikes as part of the anti-drug-trafficking campaign.</p><p>Trump has been briefed by top officials on a range of options for action inside Venezuela, including strikes on military or government facilities and special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists.</p><p>There is some public opposition to US involvement in the region. According to a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday, 70% of Americans oppose the US taking military action in Venezuela, compared with 30% who favor action. Seventy-six percent of respondents say the Trump administration has not clearly explained the US position on military action.</p><p>Officially, the Trump administration says it is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts. Trump is hoping that the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, according to a US official.</p><p>Trump has expressed some openness to a diplomatic resolution, saying last week that Maduro “would like to talk” and later suggesting that he would be open to speaking with him “at a certain time.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the status of a potential Trump-Maduro conversation.</p><p>In a sign of the escalating tensions, the US on Thursday conducted its largest military display near Venezuela, as at least six US aircraft appeared off the nation’s coast over the course of several hours, including a supersonic F/A-18E fighter jet, a B-52 strategic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, according to a CNN review of open-source flight data.</p><p>And over the weekend, three international airlines canceled their flights departing from Venezuela after the US Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over the country, according to Reuters.</p><p>CNN’s Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A sense of anxiety grips Rangpuri Pahari, a slum in India's capital Delhi.</p><p>The neighbourhood houses thousands of migrant workers who have lived hand-to-mouth for decades, mostly employed in the unorganised sector as domestic staff, cooks, mechanics, car washers and construction labourers.</p><p>Now they fear they'll have to make sudden - and costly - trips home to keep their names on India's electoral rolls.</p><p>On 4 November, India began a major exercise to revise electoral rolls across 12 states and federally administered regions.</p><p>Known as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), it covers nearly 510 million voters - or more than half of the country's 970 million electorate.</p><p>India's Election Commission (EC) says the aim of the exercise is to ensure that no eligible voter is excluded and no ineligible name remains on the rolls. A similar controversial exercise was carried out in India's Bihar state recently.</p><p>As part of this exercise, polling booth-level officers visit households across towns and villages, collecting personal identity details and voter card numbers.</p><p>For most migrant workers, an unplanned trip home means extra costs and lost wages.</p><p>\"My employers approve time off only during elections and festivals. If I take leave now, I will lose my salary. I can't afford that. And someone else could replace me,\" Anjali Mondol, who works as a domestic help, told the BBC.</p><p>Similar concerns were echoed by others in the slum. Subhashri Doloi, also a domestic worker, says: \"I was saving money to travel home in a few months to cast my vote. But if I use that money now, how will I go again during the election?\"</p><p>Some worry about the gaps in their official documents - a common problem across India, especially in rural areas.</p><p>Kusum Devi, who works in a garment factory in Delhi, is a registered voter in her village in Uttar Pradesh - one of the states where the SIR is ongoing. But her Aadhaar, a national unique identification number, shows her as a resident of Delhi.</p><p>\"There has been no problem so far, but I don't know what will happen now,\" she says.</p><p>Workers also worry that the SIR could affect their access to welfare schemes. For those from West Bengal (another state where SIR is ongoing), which borders Bangladesh, there is an added fear of being asked to prove their citizenship.</p><p>Crackdowns on alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are not new in India. In recent months, hundreds of people have been arrested on suspicion of being illegal migrants.</p><p>\"Nobody wants to be wrongfully branded as Bangladeshi,\" said Yaser Ali from West Bengal, who sells utensils. \"If this [SIR] helps us, we want to make sure that it is done right. But how do we do it on such short notice?\"</p><p>Under the guidelines, there is a provision to fill the SIR form online but most migrant workers the BBC spoke to said they were either unfamiliar with the process or found it \"too risky\".</p><p>The EC has dismissed these concerns, saying the process is being carried out in the most transparent manner.</p><p>In a statement shared with the BBC, the poll panel urged voters to opt for online verification, saying the option has been introduced especially \"for the convenience of those electors who are currently not at their place of residence\".</p><p>The physical forms, on the other hand, can be filled up by the electors themselves or \"any adult family member\", by mentioning their relationship with the elector, and handed over to the booth-level officers, it said.</p><p>The EC added that it will ensure that \"sufficient opportunity and time is given to the electors for filing claims and objections\".</p><p>For the SIR, electoral rolls from 2002 to 2004 are being used as reference.</p><p>People whose names do not appear in those lists must produce one additional document - such as their birth or caste certificates, passports, school records, post-office papers and bank documents - to be able to enrol.</p><p>Those who became eligible voters or were born after the reference year must also show supporting documents for one or both their parents.</p><p>However, an order by the EC issued on 27 October says, \"No document is to be collected from electors during the enumeration phase\" - without giving any more details.</p><p>Some workers are hopeful. Ramdhin Prajapati, a factory worker who votes in Uttar Pradesh, says he sees SIR as a \"one-time effort\" he is willing to make.</p><p>Uttar Pradesh will not go to the polls before 2027 and Mr Prajapati feels there will be enough time to make corrections if things go wrong.</p><p>But that's not the case for workers from West Bengal, where elections are a few months away.</p><p>\"There is hardly any time,\" says Uma Muniam, who works as a cook in Delhi. \"There are millions of migrants like me spread across India. Will they be able to travel twice in four months - once for SIR and again for election?\"</p><p>Rajesh Kumar, a Delhi-based trade unionist, says the poll panel needs to do more to create awareness about the process. \"Most migrant workers lack job security and the SIR exercise is causing them stress,\" he said.</p><p>According to India's 2011 census, the most recent count, the country has around 139 million migrant workers, although the actual numbers are believed to be much higher.</p><p>\"It would be useful if help desks were set up in big cities to assist these workers,\" Mr Kumar says.</p><p>Back in Rangpuri Pahari, some neighbours had gathered at Rajendranath Mallick's home last week.</p><p>Mr Mallick, one of the few migrants travelling to his West Bengal village for the SIR, has become a go-to figure in the slum, fielding constant questions. Some want him to fill out their forms once he reaches home; others, who've already sent papers to relatives, want him to check if the process has gone through.</p><p>Mr Mallick's feedback will help his neighbours decide whether, and when, they need to make the journey themselves.</p><p>Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>Cows in Denmark are falling seriously ill and even dying due to the use of the feed additive Bovaer, a series of viral social media posts claims.</p><p>The posts share videos and supposed testimonies of dairy farmers who have given their cows Bovaer, which is used to reduce methane emissions, in which they refer to the feed additive as \"poison\".</p><p>They say that cows fed with Bovaer are collapsing, developing diarrhoea, producing less milk, becoming infertile and even dying, adding that humans' food supply is also being poisoned as a result.</p><p>Some allege that stopping the use of Bovaer has led to fewer cases of paralysis and diarrhoea, healthier animals and better milk yield, and are calling for a global boycott of the substance.</p><p></p><p>While some online claims may appear hyperbolic and border on conspiracy, they are being published amid a wave of concerns among Danish dairy farmers about the health of their cattle — concerns that authorities in the country are now investigating.</p><p>Bovaer is designed to reduce methane emissions from cows by suppressing an enzyme in their digestive system that is responsible for producing methane. It is said to cut emissions by up to 30% in dairy cows and possibly even more in beef cattle.</p><p>The agricultural sector is the biggest methane emitter in Europe and accounts for about 56% of the EU's methane emissions, according to the European Environment Agency. The digestion process (known as enteric fermentation) in cattle alone accounted for 67% of the sector's methane emissions in the EU in 2020.</p><p>Food safety authorities and independent experts across the world assure that Bovaer is safe for cows, and doesn't make milk or meat from animals that have taken it unsafe for humans to consume.</p><p>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion in 2021, in which it said that Bovaer was effective and safe for dairy cows \"at the maximum recommended level\" and was of no concern for consumer safety or the environment.</p><p>It noted that its active substance, 3‐nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), can irritate the skin and may be hazardous if inhaled, and it couldn't say for sure that it was safe for other animals apart from cows.</p><p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) more recently published a notice in December 2024, explaining that cows metabolise Bovaer, so it doesn't pass to their milk or meat.</p><p>It also said that 3-NOP had passed rigorous safety assessments and that Bovaer posed no safety concerns when used at the approved dose.</p><p>\"It does not cause cancer (it is not carcinogenic or genotoxic) and poses no safety concerns to consumers, animals or the environment,\" the FSA said. \"More than 58 studies on potential risks were evaluated and it was concluded that the additive is safe at twice the recommended dose.\"</p><p>The FSA made the announcement amid a wave of controversy online, after certain British supermarkets teamed up with the Danish-Swedish company Arla Foods for a 90-day trial of Bovaer.</p><p>Some UK social media users at the time raised concerns about Bovaer's safety and poured milk down the sink in protest, while others spread rumours that US businessman Bill Gates was involved in its development and part of the \"conspiracy\".</p><p>Independent animal nutrition experts vouch for the feed additive's safety, stressing that it must be used and administered correctly, and that the scare surrounding it may stem from a misinterpretation of safety warnings on the product's label.</p><p>\"Certain people state it causes fertility issues in males, skin and eye irritation, not suitable for direct human consumption, cancer, et cetera,\" Jan Dijkstra, associate professor in ruminant nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, told The Cube, Euronews' fact-checking team.</p><p>\"However, warnings on Bovaer's safety label are as such: factory staff should wear protective clothing when diluting, dosing, or adding pure Bovaer to cattle feed,\" he added, noting that the final product is indeed safe.</p><p>\"Farmers don't use pure Bovaer,\" Dijkstra said. \"Safety warnings are completely normal for an industrial additive in concentrated powder form.\"</p><p>Bovaer's manufacturer, the Swiss-Dutch company DSM-Firmenich, assures that the additive has been proven safe by more than 15 years of research and is a vital player in reducing global methane emissions.</p><p>\"Bovaer has undergone extensive scientific evaluation, with well over a decade of research and no evidence of adverse health effects in cows,\" a company spokesperson said. \"There are no reported issues in any of the countries where Bovaer is used — beyond what is allegedly reported in Denmark.\"</p><p>The spokesperson added that the additive had been used successfully in the first nine months of the year in Denmark by 400 dairy farmers, without ever being identified as a contributor to health issues in cows.</p><p></p><p>Copenhagen mandated the use of methane-reducing feed at the beginning of 2025 to make its agriculture more climate-friendly, assuring Bovaer's safety.</p><p>However, following reports by some 350 out of around 1,600 Danish farmers of cattle illness and death, certain bodies such as the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration, SEGES Innovation and Aarhus University have begun taking reports of changes in the health and behaviour of dairy cows seriously.</p><p>DSM-Firmenich also told The Cube that the company is working with the investigation to work out what is going on, and that animal welfare is a \"top priority\".</p><p>They want to see whether Bovaer feeding could be contributing to digestive or production changes, or if other factors like diet composition explain why certain farms are reporting challenges but not others.</p><p>Nevertheless, researchers at Aarhus University have previously said that, during their extensive research on the feed additive, they have never observed the symptoms or even the death of cows that some reports have expressed.</p><p>Other experts have repeatedly reached the same conclusion.</p><p>\"Scientific studies indeed sometimes, but not always, show reduced feed intake and milk production; this effect seems to occur more frequently at higher doses of 3-NOP,\" Dijkstra told The Cube. \"It is unclear at the moment if Bovaer is really causing the problem in Denmark. For example, at the same time of introducing Bovaer, half of the farmers reporting problems changed diet composition, like opening the new batch of maize silage harvested a few weeks earlier.\"</p><p>\"So it is simply unclear if Bovaer is causing problems, or if something else happening at the same time is causing it,\" he added. \"We need to take this seriously and investigate, but we also need to stay away from any odd, untrue claims as to infertility and other symptoms mentioned before.\"</p><p></p><p>Dijkstra noted that it was strange that, in light of the reports of cow death and declining health coming from some Danish dairy farmers, none of the dozens of trials reported in scientific literature came back with any serious issues for cows' health.</p><p>\"Some studies report minor reduced feed intake and milk production, but none report issues like 'downer' cows, mastitis, or death,\" he said.</p><p>He pointed to an extensive trial published in the Journal of Dairy Science, which he was involved in, which found that in cows taking Bovaer maintained the same feed intake and even showed an increase in milk production.</p><p>\"Bovaer is used by hundreds of farmers in the Netherlands and Belgium, and other European countries; some farmers have been using it already for several years,\" Dijkstra said. \"No problems have been reported by these farmers, so the Danish situation as to cow health at present is rather unique.\"</p><p>\"We cannot explain it from science, and it is not in line with other practical experiences of farmers elsewhere, nor with scientific experiments,\" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Fact check: Are cows in Denmark dying over Bovaer additive?","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/24/fact-check-are-cows-in-denmark-dying-over-bovaer-additive","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24 11:19:31 +01:00"}

{"details":"<p>As tech firms race to release new AI tools, users are left unsure how much of their personal data these systems may take.</p><p>By Maria Briceño | PoltiFact</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Leading tech companies are in a race to release and improve artificial intelligence (AI) products, leaving users in the United States to puzzle out how much of their personal data could be extracted to train AI tools.</p><p>Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp), Google and LinkedIn have all rolled out AI app features that have the capacity to draw on users’ public profiles or emails. Google and LinkedIn offer users ways to opt out of the AI features, while Meta’s AI tool provides no means for its users to say “no, thanks.”</p><p>“Gmail just flipped a dangerous switch on October 10, 2025 and 99% of Gmail users have no idea,” a November 8 Instagram post said.</p><p>Posts warned that the platforms’ AI tool rollouts make most private information available for tech company harvesting. “Every conversation, every photo, every voice message, fed into AI and used for profit,” a November 9 X video about Meta said.</p><p>Starting December 16th, Meta will start feeding all your data to AI. This video is an instructional on how to turn these settings off. pic.twitter.com/BUJagaMr5b</p><p>— David Wolfe (@DavidWolfe) November 9, 2025</p><p></p><p>Technology companies are rarely fully transparent when it comes to the user data they collect and what they use it for, Krystyna Sikora, a research analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, told PolitiFact.</p><p>“Unsurprisingly, this lack of transparency can create significant confusion that in turn can lead to fear mongering and the spread of false information about what is and is not permissible,” Sikora said.</p><p>The best – if tedious – way for people to know and protect their privacy rights is to read the terms and conditions, since it often explicitly outlines how the data will be used and whether it will be shared with third parties, Sikora said. The US doesn’t have any comprehensive federal laws on data privacy for technology companies.</p><p>Here’s what we learned about how each platform’s AI is handling your data:</p><p>Social media claim: “Starting December 16th Meta will start reading your DMs, every conversation, every photo, every voice message fed into AI and used for profit.” – November 9 X post with 1.6 million views as of November 19.</p><p>The facts: Meta announced a new policy to take effect December 16, but that policy alone does not result in your direct messages, photos and voice messages being fed into its AI tool. The policy involves how Meta will customise users’ content and advertisements based on how they interact with Meta AI.</p><p>For example, if a user interacts with Meta’s AI chatbot about hiking, Meta might start showing that person recommendations for hiking groups or hiking boots.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean your data isn’t being used for AI purposes. Although Meta doesn’t use people’s private messages in Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger to train its AI, it does collect user content that is set to “public” mode. This can include photos, posts, comments and reels. If the user’s Meta AI conversations involve religious views, sexual orientation and racial or ethnic origin, Meta says the system is designed to avoid parlaying these interactions into ads. If users ask questions of Meta AI using its voice feature, Meta says the AI tool will use the microphone only when users give permission.</p><p>There is a caveat: The tech company says its AI might use information about people who don’t have Meta product accounts if their information appears in other users’ public posts. For example, if a Meta user mentions a non-user in a public image caption, that photo and caption could be used to train Meta AI.</p><p>Can you opt out? No. If you are using Meta platforms in these ways – making some of your posts public and using the chatbot – your data could be used by Meta AI. There is no way to deactivate Meta AI in Instagram, Facebook or Threads. WhatsApp users can deactivate the option to talk with Meta AI in their chats, but this option is available only per chat, meaning that you must deactivate the option in each chat’s advanced privacy settings.</p><p>The X post inaccurately advised people to submit this form to opt out. But the form is simply a way for users to report when Meta’s AI supplies an answer that contains someone’s personal information.</p><p>David Evan Harris, who teaches AI ethics at the University of California, Berkeley, told PolitiFact that because the US has no federal regulations about privacy and AI training, people have no standardised legal right to opt out of AI training in the way that people in countries such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom and South Korea do.</p><p>Even when social media platforms provide opt-out options for US customers, it’s often difficult to find the settings to do so, Harris said.</p><p>Deleting your Meta accounts does not eliminate the possibility of Meta AI using your past public data, Meta’s spokesperson said.</p><p>Social media claim: “Did you know Google just gave its AI access to read every email in your Gmail – even your attachments?”  – November 8 Instagram post with more than 146,000 likes as of November 19.</p><p>The facts: Google has a host of products that interact with private data in different ways. Google announced on November 5 that its AI product, Gemini Deep Research, can connect to users’ other Google products, including Gmail, Drive and Chat. But, as Forbes reported, users must first give permission to employ the tool.</p><p>Users who want to allow Gemini Deep Research to have access to private information across products can choose what data sources to employ, including Google search, Gmail, Drive and Google Chat.</p><p>There are other ways Google collects people’s data:</p><p>A Google spokesperson told PolitiFact the company doesn’t use this information to train AI when registered users are under age 13.</p><p>Google can also access people’s data when they have smart features activated in their Gmail and Google Workplace settings (that are automatically on in the US), which gives Google consent to draw on email content and user activity data to help users compose emails or suggest Google Calendar events. With optional paid subscriptions, users can access additional AI features, including in-app Gemini summaries.</p><p>Turning off Gmail’s smart features can stop Google’s AI from accessing Gmail, but it doesn’t stop Google’s access to the Gemini app, which users can either download or access in a browser.</p><p>A California lawsuit accuses Gemini of spying on users’ private communications. The lawsuit says an October policy change gives Gemini default access to private content such as emails and attachments in people’s Gmail, Chat and Meet. Before October, users had to manually allow Gemini to access the private content; now, users must go into their privacy settings to disable it. The lawsuit claims the Google policy update violates California’s 1967 Invasion of Privacy Act, a law that prohibits unauthorised wiretapping and recording confidential communications without consent.</p><p>Can you opt out? If people don’t want their conversations used to train Google AI, they can use “temporary” chats or chat without signing into their Gemini accounts. Doing that means Gemini can’t save a person’s chat history, a Google spokesperson said.

And here's the extraordinary bit: it had never been opened or disturbed since it was first sealed all those centuries ago.</p><p></p><p>\"The peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact,\" said Gabriella Fényes, the excavation's lead archaeologist.</p><p>When the Budapest History Museum team carefully prised open the heavy stone lid –which had been secured with metal clamps and molten lead – they found a complete skeleton surrounded by a treasure trove of artefacts. Inside were two perfectly preserved glass vessels, bronze figures, and an impressive haul of 140 coins. A bone hair pin, amber jewellery, and traces of gold-threaded fabric, along with the skeleton's size, suggest the tomb belonged to a young woman.</p><p></p><p>The coffin had been placed among the ruins of abandoned houses in a quarter of Aquincum that residents had vacated in the 3rd century, which was later turned into a burial ground. Whilst archaeologists also found a Roman aqueduct and eight simpler graves nearby, none came close to matching the richness or pristine condition of this sealed tomb.</p><p>All the objects were \"items given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey,\" Fényes explained.</p><p>\"The deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives.

In the end, von der Leyen was able to strike a deal that EU-produced goods arriving in the US would be taxed at a rate of 15% while Brussels lifted its duties on most US products.</p><p>Presented by the Commission as the most advantageous deal it could get, the agreement has been widely criticised across the EU. The European Parliament, which has to vote on the Commission’s proposal to remove tariffs on US goods, is set to amend the deal and is discussing a 18-month suspension clause.</p><p>The US is complaining that the EU’s legislative agenda is moving too slowly. EU lawmakers will vote on the text in January and they should agree on a common text with EU member states next March or April – a timescale radically longer than the Trump administration's preference.</p><p>Greer raised the issue in a meeting with European Parliament president Roberta Metsola last Friday.</p><p>The EU is ready to face US criticism “with good confidence” an EU diplomat said, noting that the legislative process in Brussels could have taken a lot longer.</p><p>“To my knowledge, the US administration has not taken its decisions through Congress, so it doesn't take quite as long in the US,” another EU diplomat said, implyingthat the US trade agenda was mainly decided from the White House.</p><p>The EU plans to show unity by handing over a list of proposed exemptions to the 15% tariffs they hope to obtain from the Americans. The list includes products such as wines, spirits and pasta.</p><p>“American friends are very much aware of where the European Union would like to see tariff reductions,” the same EU diplomat said.</p><p>For the Commission, which has competence to negotiate with Washington, the list of exemptions “remains a priority,” according to its deputy chief spokesperson, Arianna Podesta.</p><p>The EU is also concerned about the future of its steel exports. The US already imposes 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium, and has extended them to some 407 derivatives. A consultation already underway may see further derivatives added to the list.</p><p>As EU diplomats see it, adding tariffs on steel derivatives would go against the whole “spirit” of this summer's agreement. The same goes for investigations still open by Washington into products such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and medical devices.</p><p>EU investments will also be on the agenda. Greer and Lutnick will meet in the afternoon, EU business representatives with EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič.</p><p>The trade deal includes an EU pledge of €600 billion in investments in the US even though Brussels has no direct control over the private sector, which is the only force capable of actually delivering those investments.</p><p></p><p>Monday’s meetings will not be an easy task for the Europeans, as US pressure has been unrelenting since Donald Trump returned to the White House, with the president repeatedly threatening new tariffs or targeting EU legislation he deems too restrictive for US companies.</p><p>However, the EU has so far not looked intimidated, and is continuing to enforce the digital legislation that Trump and his administration have condemned.</p><p>In the last few weeks, Brussels has launched antitrust investigations against Amazon and Microsoft and hit Google with a €2.95 billion for abusing its dominant position in the advertising technology industry – moves that have not gone unnoticed in Washington.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"High-stakes showdown looms as US and EU trade member states meet","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/11/24/high-stakes-showdown-looms-as-us-and-eu-trade-member-states-meet","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24 07:00:50 +01:00"}

{"details":"<p>Live Updates</p><p>• Talks on a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine continue on a technical level today after meetings with US and Ukrainian officials praised by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as “substantive” and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “productive.”</p><p>• Washington said the Ukrainians believe the current draft amendment of US President Donald Trump’s 28-point peace proposal “reflects their national security interests.” The Kremlin, meanwhile, said it had not yet received any official information on the talks.</p><p>• As the diplomatic push to end the war gains momentum, EU leaders will also meet today to discuss Ukraine. And 30 countries in the “coalition of the willing”— an alliance of Kyiv’s allies — will meet tomorrow.</p><p>The United Kingdom, France and Germany had drafted a counter-proposal to the US plan with an array of key changes, Reuters has reported. A European official and a European diplomatic source confirmed the text’s accuracy to CNN’s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was striking out the language regarding the restriction of further NATO expansion. According to the draft text obtained by Reuters, the European plan states:</p><p>The European version also removed references to territorial concessions and the US proposal’s recognition of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk as de facto Russian territory.</p><p>The European draft text additionally includes a higher figure for the proposed limit on the Ukrainian military during peacetime, saying it will be capped at 800,000.</p><p>As we’ve reported, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that discussions on a plan to end the war in Ukraine would continue on a technical level today, as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also praised the “substantive” results from yesterday’s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Catch up on how the talks went:</p><p>From Kharkiv region in the north to the farmland of Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces in Ukraine are edging forward, exploiting gaps in Ukrainian defenses and a vast numerical superiority.</p><p>Russia has concentrated more than 150,000 troops in the Pokrovsk direction of Donetsk alone, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.</p><p>Russia is likely losing some 30,000 soldiers killed or wounded every month, according to western analysts. But it’s recruiting a similar number and has caught up with Ukraine in deploying a wide range of attack drones.</p><p>Mobilizing enough soldiers has become a crisis for Ukraine. More than 250,000 criminal cases have been opened into soldiers going AWOL since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Many units are seriously under staffed; for those who do serve rotations out of the frontlines get fewer and shorter.</p><p>The shortage is compounded by the sheer size of the battlefield – 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles) long from the Black Sea to the Russian border.</p><p>The south has become a hotspot as Russian forces have gradually advanced toward the city of Zaporizhzhia. They are now some 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the city and 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the south.</p><p>“Ukraine may now be approaching the point when the country no longer has enough fighters to effectively defend the full length of the front lines,” according to one analysis.</p><p>Ukraine may be able to step up its deep strikes against Russian energy and military infrastructure. But the Kremlin will see no reason to make concessions at the negotiating table while its troops are on the front-foot.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, a day after intensive talks were held between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</p><p></p><p>Trump’s comments come less than 24 hours after a previous Truth Social post where he scolded Ukrainian leadership for reportedly showing “zero gratitude” to the US for its efforts in ending the conflict.</p><p>After a day of intensive talks in Geneva on Sunday, however, US officials appear to be more optimistic that progress can be made to end the war, as we’ve reported.</p><p>We’ve seen a statement this morning from European Council President António Costa.</p><p>He said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning, to “get his assessment of the situation” ahead of the informal EU leaders’ meeting on Ukraine today.</p><p>“A united and coordinated EU position is key in ensuring a good outcome of peace negotiations - for Ukraine and for Europe,” Costa said on social media.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said it has not received any official information regarding the outcome of yesterday’s Ukraine ceasefire talks held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Look, we haven’t seen any plan yet,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing on Monday, adding that Russia would not comment on the details of the draft agreement.</p><p>“We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been plentiful over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Based on initial media reports, Peskov said, “Some adjustments have been made to the peace plan text we saw earlier. But we’ll wait and see.”</p><p>Peskov also said there are “no plans yet” for talks with the US delegation this week, and that Moscow remains open for such contacts.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukraine will continue to work closely with the United States on a proposed plan to end the fighting in his country but stressed the importance of ensuring that any plan strengthens Ukraine’s security.</p><p>“Right now, we are at a critical moment, and we are working closely with the United States, with European partners, with many, many others to define steps that can end Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, and bring real security,” he told a Swedish parliamentary summit by video link.</p><p></p><p>“We will all continue working with partners, especially the United States, looking for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken, us. And we will explain how dangerous it is to pretend that aggression is something one can simply overlook and move on,” he said.</p><p>Zelensky added that Ukraine has successfully convinced Washington to keep “extremely sensitive points” on the table, including securing the full release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, amid ongoing talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>He also called on European nations to make decisions regarding the seizing of Russian assets and said Moscow must “pay fully” for the war.</p><p>America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva on Sunday, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.</p><p>“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.</p><p>“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”</p><p></p><p>But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.</p><p>The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.</p><p>Read the full analysis here.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that talks between the United States and Ukraine in Geneva on amending a 28-point plan to end Russia’s war had produced a “decisive success” for Europeans.</p><p>“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan — this is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,” Wadephul told Deutschlandfunk radio.</p><p>“It was clear from the outset, as we have repeatedly said, that any agreement must not be reached over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he added.</p><p></p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism yesterday after what he described as productive discussions between American and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The talks were “probably the most productive and meaningful” so far, Rubio told reporters after the first session.</p><p>The 28-point peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump continues to evolve as the delegates work to achieve terms that would be acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia, Rubio said.</p><p>“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” he said, “The items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today,” he said.</p><p>The US proposal had attracted bipartisan criticism for its concessions to Russia. The plan puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military’s size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war — all long-standing Kremlin demands.</p><p>Amid the scrutiny, a US State Department spokesperson maintained that the proposal was “authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”</p><p>The White House on Sunday said “revisions and clarifications” were made to the proposal with input from top US, Ukrainian, and European officials in Geneva, adding that the Ukrainians believe that the current draft “reflects their national security interests.”</p><p>We’ll bring you key developments and the latest from any further talks today, stay with us.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A weakened Ukrainian president can now easily be turned into a scapegoat for defeat.</p><p>By Leonid Ragozin</p><p>Leonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Riga.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>On November 10, the Ukrainian anticorruption authorities revealed that close associates of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were allegedly involved in a scheme to embezzle $100m from Ukraine’s energy sector.</p><p>Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.</p><p>The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.</p><p>Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.</p><p>What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.</p><p>Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.</p><p>That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.</p><p>It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.</p><p>The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.</p><p>Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.</p><p>It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.</p><p>To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.</p><p>The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.</p><p>But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.</p><p>He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.</p><p>A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.</p><p>The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"A corruption scandal may well end the war in Ukraine","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/23/a-corruption-scandal-may-well-end-the-war-in-ukraine","message":"","updatedAt":"23 Nov 2025"}

{"details":"<p>Israel kills top Hezbollah commander only two days after Lebanon’s president said he was open to negotiations.</p><p>By Justin Salhani</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Israel has killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, which comes only two days after Lebanon’s president announced the country had succumbed to an Israeli pressure campaign and agreed to hold negotiations.</p><p>Hezbollah confirmed that its chief of staff, Haytham Ali Tabtabai, was among five people killed and 28 others wounded in the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood on Sunday.</p><p>Israeli officials and media have warned of a renewed escalation against Lebanon in recent weeks, claiming Hezbollah is regrouping and rearming. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.</p><p>“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.</p><p>Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.</p><p>Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite an ostensible ceasefire, Israel has intensified attacks in Lebanon’s south and Bekaa Valley in recent days. At least 13 people were killed by an Israeli strike on Lebanon’s largest Palestinian refugee camp last week, in an attack that killed mostly children and marked the highest death toll in a single strike since a ceasefire was agreed in November last year.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since then, including around 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. It also continues to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon, despite the ceasefire stating Israel would withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory.</p><p>“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”</p><p>Tabtabai’s killing marks the highest-ranking Hezbollah target killed since the ceasefire. The attack also came a week to the day before Pope Leo XIV’s planned visit to the country and a day after Lebanon mutedly celebrated its 82nd independence day.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet approved a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.</p><p>Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.</p><p>The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.</p><p>“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks once. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.</p><p>Still, there are concerns in Lebanon that the group may decide to soon change tactics.</p><p>“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”</p><p>Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.</p><p>Analysts said many in the country fervently oppose direct negotiations, though the government has expressed a willingness to enter indirect talks, similar to 2022’s maritime agreement between Israel and Lebanon.</p><p>Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.</p><p>But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has repeatedly violated.</p><p>“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Israel’s bombing of Beirut comes days after Lebanon agreed to talks","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks","message":"","updatedAt":"23 Nov 2025"}

{"details":"<p>Top diplomats from the US, EU and Ukraine are meeting in Geneva to discuss Donald Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia.</p><p>By Yashraj Sharma</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Top United States officials are holding talks with Ukrainian and European diplomats in Geneva to discuss US President Donald Trump’s peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>But the so-called 28-point plan pushed by the Trump administration has alarmed Ukraine and its European allies, who see it as a capitulation to Russian demands, particularly territorial concessions and limits on the size of Ukraine’s military.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Trump had set a November 27 deadline for Ukraine to accept his peace plan, but after pushback from European leaders, Washington appears to have softened its stance, with Trump saying the plan did not represent a “final offer” for Ukraine.</p><p>This will likely create some wriggle room for diplomacy at the high-stakes talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>So, why are Ukraine’s European allies opposed to the draft plan? Who’s participating? What’s on the agenda in Geneva? And does the plan favour Moscow?</p><p>The talks are an attempt to reconcile the contentious draft peace plan, as Kyiv and its European allies want Kyiv’s long-term security interests protected.</p><p>Representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will join top US officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss how to end the war – Europe’s deadliest since World War II. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there will also be a Russian presence.</p><p>The talks, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, “could be the most decisive moment for Ukraine”.</p><p>“There is a great deal of anxiety among Ukrainians and Europeans about the nature of the 28-plan drafted by the Americans,” said Ahelbarra, reporting from Geneva.</p><p>“The concerns are about the territorial concessions: We’re talking about Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which the Ukrainians, as per the plan, have to give up in exchange for the potential of a permanent deal with Russia. They have to freeze the front lines, particularly in Kherson and Zaporizhia.</p><p>“The third element is the reduction of the capacity of the Ukrainian armed forces from 900,000 soldiers to 600,000, and this is widely perceived by the Ukrainians as a major concession they cannot afford to make,” Ahelbarra said.</p><p>In a post on X on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hopes “there will be a result”.</p><p>“The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I am awaiting the results of today’s talks and hope that all participants will be constructive. We all need a positive outcome.”</p><p>The US’s Rubio and Witkoff are leading the Geneva talks, which will also include US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.</p><p>Nine Ukrainian officials are attending the talks, including Ukraine’s presidential office chief Andriy Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, who have been empowered to deal directly with Russia by the president.</p><p>National security advisers from the E3 alliance of France, Britain and Germany will also join the discussions, alongside other officials from the EU, including Italy.</p><p>Ukraine’s European allies say the current peace plan does not address Ukraine’s security concerns. They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.</p><p>She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.</p><p>“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>On the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, European and other Western leaders pushed back against Trump’s plan, saying it required “additional work”.</p><p>“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has since captured large parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region. Moscow had annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.</p><p>According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</p><p>The proposed plan would also see Ukraine cut its army and renounce its ambitions to join NATO, which has been a major sticking point in the earlier proposals. The size of the Ukrainian armed forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.</p><p>“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during the G20 summit briefing. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”</p><p>Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.</p><p>Speaking with reporters ahead of the G20 summit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.</p><p>In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.</p><p>Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.</p><p>EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”</p><p>But US Vice President JD Vance has rebuked criticism of the peace plan.</p><p>“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”</p><p>Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was trying to defend its sovereignty while retaining the support of its most important ally, the United States. Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.</p><p>“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.</p><p>In a 10-minute speech outside the presidential palace, Zelenskyy said that if his country follows through on the proposed plan, it would leave Kyiv “without freedom, dignity and justice”.</p><p>Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will propose alternatives,” said the Ukrainian president. He then referred to the Russian invasion in February 2022, saying: “We did not betray Ukraine then, we will not do so now.”</p><p>On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.</p><p>“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p><p>European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.</p><p>A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.</p><p>“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.</p><p>However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.”</p><p>Later, a US Department of State spokesperson said Rounds’s account of his conversation with Rubio was “blatantly false”.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, said Washington’s 28-point plan could “lay the foundation for a final peace settlement”.</p><p>Putin also threatened to seize more territory if Ukraine does not accept the proposal, warning that the reported capture of the Ukrainian city of Kupiansk “will inevitably be repeated in other key areas of the front line”.</p><p>Speaking from Kyiv, journalist Audrey MacAlpine said Russia has been making battlefield gains in regions of Ukraine where the peace proposal would hand it territory along the line of contact.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera that Moscow had carried out overnight attacks on Kherson and Zaporizhia, two regions where Russia would gain de facto control under the 28-point plan being discussed in Geneva.</p><p>“No doubt Russia is trying to make gains in these particular regions, and they’ve been successful,” she said. “They’ve been making slow but concerted gains.”</p><p>We do not know yet.</p><p>During his presidential campaign leading up to the 2024 US election, Trump claimed that he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within a day. But a deal proved elusive despite Washington’s diplomatic push.</p><p>Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has made resolving foreign conflicts central to US foreign policy. He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.</p><p>But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.</p><p>Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting. But his attempt to organise a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not materialised.</p><p>In August, Trump warned Russia of severe consequences if Putin refused to end the war. He even announced sanctions on Moscow to force it to end the war. He also slapped hefty tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, which he said was financing Moscow’s war efforts.</p><p>As the talks were under way in Geneva on Sunday, Trump again took aim at Ukraine, saying Kyiv has not been grateful for American efforts related to the war with Russia.</p><p>“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA. THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on X, echoing remarks he made during a heated exchange in the White House in February in which Trump and US Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"US-Ukraine talks: Why are European leaders opposing Trump’s peace plan?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan","message":"","updatedAt":"23 Nov 2025"}

{"details":"<p>Slovenia’s move to legalise euthanasia comes as a growing number of countries favour reform.</p><p>By Alex Kozul-Wright and News Agencies</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Slovenia is voting on whether to legalise assisted dying for some terminally ill adults after other European countries have made the change.</p><p>The parliament of the small European Union nation passed a euthanasia bill in July, but a citizens initiative, led by right-wing politician Ales Primc, forced the referendum on Sunday.</p><p>The law will be rejected if at least 20 percent of participating voters oppose the bill. Slovenia has an electorate of 1.69 million people.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said it will alleviate unnecessary pain. Those against said society should care for the sick, not help them die.</p><p>Several European countries – including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland – already allow terminally ill people to receive medical help to end their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Under the disputed law, which was set to take effect this year, lucid but terminally ill patients would have had the right to die if their suffering had become unbearable and all other treatment options had been exhausted.</p><p>The legislation is similar to the assisted dying bill passed by the United Kingdom Parliament in June. Britain’s bill allows assisted suicide for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, the approvals of two doctors, judicial oversight and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>Slovenia’s law would require the approval of two doctors but also cooling-off periods and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>About 54 percent of citizens back the legalisation of assisted dying, almost 31 percent oppose it and 15 percent are undecided, according to a poll published this week by the Dnevnik daily based on 700 responses. In June 2024, 55 percent backed the law.</p><p>Prime Minister Robert Golob urged citizens to back the law “so that each of us can decide for ourselves how and with what dignity we will end our lives”.</p><p>Marijan Janzekovic, an 86-year-old who lives in the town of Sveti Tomaz near the capital, Ljubljana, also supports the bill.</p><p>His wife, Alenka Curin-Janzekovic, was in pain from diabetes-related illnesses before she ended her life at a suicide clinic in Switzerland in 2023.</p><p>“She was in a wheelchair … and in pain so bad my heart hurt just by watching her,” he told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The main political group opposing the law, called Voice for the Children and the Family, has accused the government of using the law to “poison” ill and elderly people.</p><p>Opponents said the law is inhumane and violates Slovenia’s Constitution, which declares human life inviolable.</p><p>Elsewhere, Slovenian Catholic Archbishop Stanislav Zore said the state should focus on palliative care instead.</p><p>“Let’s care for the sick and dying but not offer them suicide,” he said. The Catholic Church is opposed to euthanasia.</p><p>Assisted dying is already permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, several states in the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.</p><p>In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several US states, assisted dying laws are generally framed around medical aid. These jurisdictions typically require that patients be terminally ill, mentally competent and assessed by two independent doctors.</p><p>In many of these countries, the patient must self-administer lethal medication rather than have a doctor provide it directly. These regimes prioritise patient autonomy and strict procedural safeguards, such as waiting periods.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal, the approach to assisted dying is permissive. Active euthanasia or doctor-administered treatment is legal under defined conditions of unbearable suffering, even if the patient is not terminally ill.</p><p>In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, only assisted suicide is legally tolerated as opposed to active euthanasia. Switzerland is an outlier insofar as there is no dedicated regulatory regime for euthanasia, meaning nonresidents may access the service via organisations.</p><p>In May, France’s National Assembly approved a “right-to-die” bill. The legislation would allow adults over 18 who are citizens or residents and suffer from incurable illnesses and “intolerable” physical or psychological suffering to request lethal medication.</p><p>Under the bill, a medical team must assess the patient’s condition before a mandatory reflection period before the prescription of a lethal substance. If the patient is physically unable to self-administer, a doctor or nurse may assist.</p><p>The proposal excludes people with severe psychiatric conditions or neurodegenerative disorders like advanced Alzheimer’s disease. The bill now has to go to the Senate and must return to the National Assembly for a second reading before it could become law.</p><p>Elsewhere, Britain’s lower house voted to legalise assisted dying in June. The House of Commons narrowly voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, marking a major step towards legalising assisted dying in England and Wales.</p><p>The bill would allow mentally competent adults with a prognosis of less than six months to live to request medical help to end their lives, subject to assessments by two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a social worker.</p><p>The legislation is not yet law. It must still get through the House of Lords, where it will be further scrutinised and may be amended. If it does become law, the timeline for implementation may not be until 2029.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Slovenia referendum: Where is assisted dying legal?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/23/slovenia-referendum-where-is-assisted-dying-legal","message":"","updatedAt":"23 Nov 2025"}
{"details":"<p>Live Updates</p><p>• Talks on a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine continue on a technical level today after meetings with US and Ukrainian officials praised by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as “substantive” and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “productive.”</p><p>• Washington said the Ukrainians believe the current draft amendment of US President Donald Trump’s 28-point peace proposal “reflects their national security interests.” The Kremlin, meanwhile, said it had not yet received any official information on the talks.</p><p>• As the diplomatic push to end the war gains momentum, EU leaders will also meet today to discuss Ukraine. And 30 countries in the “coalition of the willing”— an alliance of Kyiv’s allies — will meet tomorrow.</p><p>The United Kingdom, France and Germany had drafted a counter-proposal to the US plan with an array of key changes, Reuters has reported. A European official and a European diplomatic source confirmed the text’s accuracy to CNN’s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was striking out the language regarding the restriction of further NATO expansion. According to the draft text obtained by Reuters, the European plan states:</p><p>The European version also removed references to territorial concessions and the US proposal’s recognition of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk as de facto Russian territory.</p><p>The European draft text additionally includes a higher figure for the proposed limit on the Ukrainian military during peacetime, saying it will be capped at 800,000.</p><p>As we’ve reported, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that discussions on a plan to end the war in Ukraine would continue on a technical level today, as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also praised the “substantive” results from yesterday’s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Catch up on how the talks went:</p><p>From Kharkiv region in the north to the farmland of Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces in Ukraine are edging forward, exploiting gaps in Ukrainian defenses and a vast numerical superiority.</p><p>Russia has concentrated more than 150,000 troops in the Pokrovsk direction of Donetsk alone, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.</p><p>Russia is likely losing some 30,000 soldiers killed or wounded every month, according to western analysts. But it’s recruiting a similar number and has caught up with Ukraine in deploying a wide range of attack drones.</p><p>Mobilizing enough soldiers has become a crisis for Ukraine. More than 250,000 criminal cases have been opened into soldiers going AWOL since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Many units are seriously under staffed; for those who do serve rotations out of the frontlines get fewer and shorter.</p><p>The shortage is compounded by the sheer size of the battlefield – 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles) long from the Black Sea to the Russian border.</p><p>The south has become a hotspot as Russian forces have gradually advanced toward the city of Zaporizhzhia. They are now some 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the city and 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the south.</p><p>“Ukraine may now be approaching the point when the country no longer has enough fighters to effectively defend the full length of the front lines,” according to one analysis.</p><p>Ukraine may be able to step up its deep strikes against Russian energy and military infrastructure. But the Kremlin will see no reason to make concessions at the negotiating table while its troops are on the front-foot.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, a day after intensive talks were held between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</p><p></p><p>Trump’s comments come less than 24 hours after a previous Truth Social post where he scolded Ukrainian leadership for reportedly showing “zero gratitude” to the US for its efforts in ending the conflict.</p><p>After a day of intensive talks in Geneva on Sunday, however, US officials appear to be more optimistic that progress can be made to end the war, as we’ve reported.</p><p>We’ve seen a statement this morning from European Council President António Costa.</p><p>He said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning, to “get his assessment of the situation” ahead of the informal EU leaders’ meeting on Ukraine today.</p><p>“A united and coordinated EU position is key in ensuring a good outcome of peace negotiations - for Ukraine and for Europe,” Costa said on social media.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said it has not received any official information regarding the outcome of yesterday’s Ukraine ceasefire talks held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Look, we haven’t seen any plan yet,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing on Monday, adding that Russia would not comment on the details of the draft agreement.</p><p>“We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been plentiful over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Based on initial media reports, Peskov said, “Some adjustments have been made to the peace plan text we saw earlier. But we’ll wait and see.”</p><p>Peskov also said there are “no plans yet” for talks with the US delegation this week, and that Moscow remains open for such contacts.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukraine will continue to work closely with the United States on a proposed plan to end the fighting in his country but stressed the importance of ensuring that any plan strengthens Ukraine’s security.</p><p>“Right now, we are at a critical moment, and we are working closely with the United States, with European partners, with many, many others to define steps that can end Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, and bring real security,” he told a Swedish parliamentary summit by video link.</p><p></p><p>“We will all continue working with partners, especially the United States, looking for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken, us. And we will explain how dangerous it is to pretend that aggression is something one can simply overlook and move on,” he said.</p><p>Zelensky added that Ukraine has successfully convinced Washington to keep “extremely sensitive points” on the table, including securing the full release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, amid ongoing talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>He also called on European nations to make decisions regarding the seizing of Russian assets and said Moscow must “pay fully” for the war.</p><p>America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva on Sunday, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.</p><p>“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.</p><p>“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”</p><p></p><p>But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.</p><p>The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.</p><p>Read the full analysis here.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that talks between the United States and Ukraine in Geneva on amending a 28-point plan to end Russia’s war had produced a “decisive success” for Europeans.</p><p>“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan — this is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,” Wadephul told Deutschlandfunk radio.</p><p>“It was clear from the outset, as we have repeatedly said, that any agreement must not be reached over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he added.</p><p></p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism yesterday after what he described as productive discussions between American and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The talks were “probably the most productive and meaningful” so far, Rubio told reporters after the first session.</p><p>The 28-point peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump continues to evolve as the delegates work to achieve terms that would be acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia, Rubio said.</p><p>“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” he said, “The items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today,” he said.</p><p>The US proposal had attracted bipartisan criticism for its concessions to Russia. The plan puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military’s size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war — all long-standing Kremlin demands.</p><p>Amid the scrutiny, a US State Department spokesperson maintained that the proposal was “authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”</p><p>The White House on Sunday said “revisions and clarifications” were made to the proposal with input from top US, Ukrainian, and European officials in Geneva, adding that the Ukrainians believe that the current draft “reflects their national security interests.”</p><p>We’ll bring you key developments and the latest from any further talks today, stay with us.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Beijing is expected to strike a conciliatory tone at this year’s G20 and expand its foothold in the African continent.</p><p>By Federica Marsi</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>US President Donald Trump’s decision to snub the G20 summit in South Africa this year has handed an opportunity to China, as it seeks to expand its growing influence in the African continent and position itself as an alternative to the dangers of a unilateralist United States.</p><p>Washington said it would not attend the two-day summit set to kick off on Saturday over widely discredited claims that the host country, previously ruled by its white minority under an apartheid system until 1994, now mistreats white people.</p><p>South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa hit back at Trump’s claim that hosting the summit in Johannesburg was a “total disgrace”. “Boycott politics doesn’t work,” Ramaphosa said, adding that the US was “giving up the very important role that they should be playing as the biggest economy in the world”.</p><p>By Friday morning, Trump appeared to have backtracked on his stance somewhat, when speculation that Washington might send a US official to Johannesburg after all circulated.</p><p>Regardless, the spat comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping sends Premier Li Qiang to represent him on the world stage. China’s 72-year-old president has dialled back foreign visits, increasingly delegating his top emissary.</p><p>“The US is giving China an opportunity to expand its global influence,” Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University, told Al Jazeera. “With the absence of the US, China and EU countries will be the focus of the summit and other countries will look for leadership [from them].”</p><p>But observers say that while Trump’s absence will direct heightened attention to Beijing’s statements and behaviour, it does not spell the end of the US-led order altogether.</p><p>Jing Gu, a political economist at the United Kingdom-based Institute of Development Studies, said the US’s failure to attend “does not automatically make China the new leader, but it creates visible space for China to present itself as a more stable, reliable partner in governance”.</p><p>“It reinforces the perception that the US is stepping back from multilateralism and the shared management of global problems,” she said. “In that context, China can present itself as a more predictable, stable actor and emphasise continuity, support for open trade and engagement with the Global South.”</p><p>This year’s G20 will, for the first time, have an African chair and take place on the African continent. The African Union (AU) will also participate fully as a member.</p><p>South Africa, which holds the G20 presidency, is expected to push for consensus and action on priority issues for African countries, including debt relief, economic growth, climate change and transition to clean energy.</p><p>Zhu, who also serves as editor-in-chief of the academic journal, China and the World, said South Africa’s themes were a “natural fit” for China, Africa’s largest trading partner.</p><p>“China aims to become a leader in green energy, and there’s a lot of room for China and African countries to work on that,” he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The African continent, with its mineral wealth, booming population and fast-growing economies, offers huge potential for Chinese firms. Li, China’s premier, travelled to Zambia this week, marking the first visit to the country by a Chinese premier in 28 years. The copper-rich nation has Beijing as its largest official creditor for $5.7bn.</p><p>Eager to secure access to Zambia’s commodities and expand its exports from resource-rich East Africa, China signed a $1.4bn deal in September to rehabilitate the Tazara Railway, built in the 1970s and connecting Tanzania and Zambia, to improve rail-sea transportation in the region.</p><p>“The Chinese economy and African economy are complementary; they both benefit from trade,” Zhu said. The G20 “is a great platform for China to project its global influence and seek opportunities to work with other countries”, he added.</p><p>Africa’s growing demand for energy and China’s dominance in manufacturing make the two a good fit, observers say. This is playing out. A report by energy think tank Ember, for instance, found Africa’s imports of solar panels from China rose a whopping 60 percent in the 12 months to June 2025.</p><p>According to Gu at the Institute of Development Studies, China will be looking to tap into this growing synergy with Africa and will deliver a three-fold message at this year’s G20.</p><p>“First, it will stress stability and the importance of global rules and regulations,” she said. Second, “it will link the G20 to the Global South and highlight issues like development and green transformation”.</p><p>Third, “by offering issue-based leadership on topics such as digital economy, artificial intelligence and governance, it will position itself as a problem-solver rather than a disruptor”, the economist added.</p><p>An absence of American officials at this year’s G20 – after skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Korea as well as the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil – would be “another opportunity for China”, Rosemary Foot, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It can contrast, yet again, its declared commitment to multilateralism and responsible behaviour as a major state versus the dangers of a unilateralist America focusing not on public goods but on benefits to itself only.”</p><p>China has been looking to expand its influence in Africa as a counterweight to the US-led world order. In stark contrast to Trump’s decision to end Africa’s duty-free era and slap 15-30 percent tariffs on 22 nations, Xi announced at the APEC summit last month a zero-tariff policy for all African nations with diplomatic ties to Beijing.</p><p>On that occasion, Xi emphasised China’s commitment “to joint development and shared prosperity with all countries”, stressing the country’s goal to “support more developing countries in achieving modernisation and opening up new avenues for global development”.</p><p>Similarly, Li, China’s premier, marked the United Nations’ 80th anniversary at the General Assembly in September by expressing the need for stronger collective action on climate change and emerging technologies, calling for greater solidarity to “[lift] everyone up, while division drags all down”.</p><p>His remarks were in stark contrast to Trump’s, who, in his speech, described climate change as the “greatest con job ever perpetrated” and called renewable sources of energy a “joke” and “pathetic”.</p><p>Foot said the spotlight will now be on Beijing as it seeks to strike a similar conciliatory pose – and in doing so, set itself apart from the US – at the G20. “Whether Beijing will have a major impact on the G20 agenda is more difficult to determine,” she said.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"How Trump’s absence marks leadership opportunity for China at G20","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/how-trumps-absence-marks-leadership-opportunity-for-china-at-g20","message":"","updatedAt":"21 Nov 2025"}

{"details":"<p>Test your eye for visual effects. What’s real and what’s not might surprise you.</p><p>In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.</p><p>But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.</p><p>“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”</p><p>Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.</p><p>To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>2. Production</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.</p><p>“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.</p><p>Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.</p><p>“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”</p><p>Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.</p><p>But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)</p><p>Take a look below at how “Severance” planned out its Season 2 opening using rough 3D models.</p><p>An animatic, or basic animation with simple, undetailed 3D models, helped the “Severance” crew plan the exact cadence, camera angles and more.</p><p></p><p>In this first shot, a Bolt motion camera uses a robotic arm for rapid back-and-forth shots.</p><p>Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-</p><p>generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.</p><p>The visual effects team also coordinates with other departments to ensure production goes smoothly.</p><p>“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.</p><p>The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”</p><p>Case in point: “Wicked” used exclusively blue screens because of how prominent green in the story, including Elphaba’s skin, the Emerald City and guard uniforms. And certain scenes required a scale that was unrealistic to build. So instead, production design built interior sets up to 25 feet and exterior sets up to 55 feet. Visual effects took care of the rest.</p><p>“Filmmaking is one of the those disciplines where everything is done through collaborating with each other,” said Helman. “There are about 1,000 people just on visual effects” for the “Wicked” films, he said. He added, “We all put a little bit into the creative process so that the movie has texture and has layers.”</p><p>2. Production</p><p>Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>Shooting begins on the project.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.</p><p>“Maybe it was this perfect shot of the sunset, and my two leads were finally getting together. And a car drove by in the background that no one knew about,” said ILM’s Eric Leven, the visual effects supervisor for Season 2 of “Severance.”</p><p>Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.</p><p>That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.</p><p>Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.</p><p>Early, simple 3D models can also help directors and actors in the shooting process. James Cameron’s Avatar films, which feature the blue alien species called Na’vi, heavily relied on a depth compositing tool that rendered those aliens, CGI objects and environments in real time on the camera screen as filming took place.</p><p>“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”</p><p>The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.</p><p>This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.</p><p>“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.</p><p>The “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage. This allows James Cameron to walk through an empty set but see things as if he were filming in</p><p>real time.</p><p>How the “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

Marketing and trailers start in earnest at this stage.</p><p>Once shooting wraps, the postproduction phase begins and the team puts together the final product.</p><p>“[“Jurassic World Rebirth” director] Gareth Edwards said that prep and shoot is where you go shopping for your meal, and post is where you actually get to cook it,” said Vickery.</p><p>The visual effects team works in close conjunction with the director and editor throughout this phase. Artists will create rough drafts of the visual effects with the real footage for the director’s approval and feedback. The editor will incorporate the evolving VFX shots into the main edit. As the shots come together, the director can see the overall flow of the film and slowly, the picture comes alive.</p><p>“In visual effects, everything happens in layers,” said Helman. “There could be 30, 40 people working on one shot at the same time.”</p><p>The number of visual effects shots can rack up quickly. “Jurassic World Rebirth” had about 1,500 VFX shots; “Wicked: For Good” had about 2,000 and “Avatar: The Way of Water” had over 3,200. Comparatively, a 2010 study found that the average number of total shots per movie (including non-VFX and VFX) was about 1,100.</p><p>But Helman emphasizes that regardless of how many shots there are, the end goal is to make a cohesive story. “It always goes back to sitting around a fire with a bunch of people at night, listening to somebody telling a story. You’re just changing the tools a little bit. And that’s all we are. We are a tool to tell a story,” Helman said.</p><p>Leven estimates a single visual effect shot passes through four to six people and takes three to six weeks to complete. For Severance’s Season 2 hallway run, the  total — including previs and postvis teams and people on set —  involved about 20 to 25 people for the two-minute scene.</p><p>A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual one in a CG world.</p><p>Environmental specialists build the CG world.

For instance, the elevator doorway needed to be blended with the real-life set.</p><p>Every visual effects shot goes through multiple rounds of feedback and painstaking edits. Maybe the edges of moving hair don’t quite have the right amount of blur. Maybe a door looks too narrow. The “Wicked” team, for example, paid particular attention to the animals so they could get across emotional nuances despite limited facial expressions.</p><p>And if that weren’t enough, the marketing team starts its job well in advance of the finish line. “It’s like releasing an ad campaign out before the product’s ready,” said Vickery. Audience screenings often happen midway through post production, and trailers are needed before the film is finished. “They’re definitely things that make for a lot of hard work from the visual effects department.”</p><p>This year’s “Superman,” for example, released a trailer that got some people up in arms over a oddly edited shot of Superman flying. Fans claimed there was “bad CGI” on actor David Corenswet’s face, but director James Gunn later said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was just an unfinished VFX composite shot that’s “not even the shot that’s in the movie.”</p><p>At the end of the day, even the best visual effects team can be undercut by unreasonable expectations and timelines. And for the artists, it can be frustrating when only the worst of their work gets noticed.</p><p>“What [the audience has] to understand is that visual effects artists are incredibly passionate artists who put a lot of love and care and attention into what they do. … [You] don’t see 90 percent of the visual effects work that they do. [You] only notice the 10 or 5 percent that’s not perfectly executed,” said Vickery.</p><p>Leven also echoed similar sentiments and explained poor work is rarely because of a lack of talent or technology.</p><p>“Usually the effects artists working on it don’t have enough time. Maybe it was a last-minute addition.

{"details":"<p>Islamabad balances alliances, economic needs and public sentiment as it weighs potential troop deployment to Gaza.</p><p>By Abid Hussain</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Islamabad, Pakistan – When the United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a United States-authored resolution that paves the way for a transitional administration and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, Pakistan – which was presiding over the council – had a seemingly contradictory response.</p><p>Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, thanked the US for tabling the resolution and voted in its favour. But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.</p><p>Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the mandate of the ISF.</p><p>“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.</p><p>But the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.</p><p>The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.</p><p>“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”</p><p>In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.</p><p>Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.</p><p>Pakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.</p><p>In September, Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.</p><p>By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it shot down Indian jets, Munir met Trump in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.</p><p>In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s rare earth minerals.</p><p>Now, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”</p><p>That’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.</p><p>Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.</p><p>That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.</p><p>Officially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.</p><p>Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.</p><p>“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.</p><p>In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.</p><p>“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.</p><p>Some retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.</p><p>Muhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.</p><p>“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.</p><p>Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.</p><p>Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.</p><p>The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.</p><p>Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.</p><p>So far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.</p><p>US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.</p><p>King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.</p><p>Bokhari argued Pakistan has limited options, adding that many of its close allies are “deeply committed” to the initiative and have sought Islamabad’s participation.</p><p>“Pakistan’s economic and financial problems mean it will need to reciprocate militarily in order to secure” the goodwill of the US and Islamabad’s Gulf allies, he said. “We have to assume that the current civilian-military leadership is aware of the domestic political risks.”</p><p>Others point to Pakistan’s long experience with UN peacekeeping. As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.</p><p>Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.</p><p>Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.</p><p>“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.</p><p>“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.</p><p>Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.</p><p>Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.</p><p>Still, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.</p><p>Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.</p><p>“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.</p><p>Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.</p><p>“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.</p><p>But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.</p><p>Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.</p><p>“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Can Pakistan join the Gaza stabilisation force without facing backlash?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash","message":"","updatedAt":"22 Nov 2025"}
{"details":"<p>Test your eye for visual effects. What’s real and what’s not might surprise you.</p><p>In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.</p><p>But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.</p><p>“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”</p><p>Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.</p><p>To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>2. Production</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.</p><p>“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.</p><p>Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.</p><p>“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”</p><p>Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.</p><p>But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)</p><p>Take a look below at how “Severance” planned out its Season 2 opening using rough 3D models.</p><p>An animatic, or basic animation with simple, undetailed 3D models, helped the “Severance” crew plan the exact cadence, camera angles and more.</p><p></p><p>In this first shot, a Bolt motion camera uses a robotic arm for rapid back-and-forth shots.</p><p>Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-</p><p>generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.</p><p>The visual effects team also coordinates with other departments to ensure production goes smoothly.</p><p>“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.</p><p>The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”</p><p>Case in point: “Wicked” used exclusively blue screens because of how prominent green in the story, including Elphaba’s skin, the Emerald City and guard uniforms. And certain scenes required a scale that was unrealistic to build. So instead, production design built interior sets up to 25 feet and exterior sets up to 55 feet. Visual effects took care of the rest.</p><p>“Filmmaking is one of the those disciplines where everything is done through collaborating with each other,” said Helman. “There are about 1,000 people just on visual effects” for the “Wicked” films, he said. He added, “We all put a little bit into the creative process so that the movie has texture and has layers.”</p><p>2. Production</p><p>Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>3.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.</p><p>“Maybe it was this perfect shot of the sunset, and my two leads were finally getting together. And a car drove by in the background that no one knew about,” said ILM’s Eric Leven, the visual effects supervisor for Season 2 of “Severance.”</p><p>Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.</p><p>That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.</p><p>Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.</p><p>Early, simple 3D models can also help directors and actors in the shooting process. James Cameron’s Avatar films, which feature the blue alien species called Na’vi, heavily relied on a depth compositing tool that rendered those aliens, CGI objects and environments in real time on the camera screen as filming took place.</p><p>“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”</p><p>The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.</p><p>This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.</p><p>“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.</p><p>The “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage. This allows James Cameron to walk through an empty set but see things as if he were filming in</p><p>real time.</p><p>How the “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

Marketing and trailers start in earnest at this stage.</p><p>Once shooting wraps, the postproduction phase begins and the team puts together the final product.</p><p>“[“Jurassic World Rebirth” director] Gareth Edwards said that prep and shoot is where you go shopping for your meal, and post is where you actually get to cook it,” said Vickery.</p><p>The visual effects team works in close conjunction with the director and editor throughout this phase. Artists will create rough drafts of the visual effects with the real footage for the director’s approval and feedback. The editor will incorporate the evolving VFX shots into the main edit. As the shots come together, the director can see the overall flow of the film and slowly, the picture comes alive.</p><p>“In visual effects, everything happens in layers,” said Helman. “There could be 30, 40 people working on one shot at the same time.”</p><p>The number of visual effects shots can rack up quickly. “Jurassic World Rebirth” had about 1,500 VFX shots; “Wicked: For Good” had about 2,000 and “Avatar: The Way of Water” had over 3,200. Comparatively, a 2010 study found that the average number of total shots per movie (including non-VFX and VFX) was about 1,100.</p><p>But Helman emphasizes that regardless of how many shots there are, the end goal is to make a cohesive story. “It always goes back to sitting around a fire with a bunch of people at night, listening to somebody telling a story. You’re just changing the tools a little bit. And that’s all we are. We are a tool to tell a story,” Helman said.</p><p>Leven estimates a single visual effect shot passes through four to six people and takes three to six weeks to complete. For Severance’s Season 2 hallway run, the  total — including previs and postvis teams and people on set —  involved about 20 to 25 people for the two-minute scene.</p><p>A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual one in a CG world.</p><p>Environmental specialists build the CG world.

Maybe the edges of moving hair don’t quite have the right amount of blur. Maybe a door looks too narrow. The “Wicked” team, for example, paid particular attention to the animals so they could get across emotional nuances despite limited facial expressions.</p><p>And if that weren’t enough, the marketing team starts its job well in advance of the finish line. “It’s like releasing an ad campaign out before the product’s ready,” said Vickery. Audience screenings often happen midway through post production, and trailers are needed before the film is finished. “They’re definitely things that make for a lot of hard work from the visual effects department.”</p><p>This year’s “Superman,” for example, released a trailer that got some people up in arms over a oddly edited shot of Superman flying. Fans claimed there was “bad CGI” on actor David Corenswet’s face, but director James Gunn later said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was just an unfinished VFX composite shot that’s “not even the shot that’s in the movie.”</p><p>At the end of the day, even the best visual effects team can be undercut by unreasonable expectations and timelines. And for the artists, it can be frustrating when only the worst of their work gets noticed.</p><p>“What [the audience has] to understand is that visual effects artists are incredibly passionate artists who put a lot of love and care and attention into what they do. … [You] don’t see 90 percent of the visual effects work that they do. [You] only notice the 10 or 5 percent that’s not perfectly executed,” said Vickery.</p><p>Leven also echoed similar sentiments and explained poor work is rarely because of a lack of talent or technology.</p><p>“Usually the effects artists working on it don’t have enough time.

{"details":"<p>America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.</p><p>“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.</p><p>Even President Donald Trump, who just hours earlier had again publicly scolded the Ukrainian leadership for expressing what he regarded as insufficient gratitude, was now “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made,” Rubio added.</p><p>But the Secretary of State, who unexpectedly appeared in the briefing room alone, instead of being accompanied, as he had been earlier that day, by the powerful head of the Ukrainian delegation, Andriy Yermak, repeatedly refused to be drawn on the specifics of what had been achieved.</p><p>“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”</p><p>But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.</p><p>The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.</p><p>The US proposals seen by CNN suggest the area becomes a Russian demilitarized zone, which the Kremlin’s military forces would agree not to enter. But ordering the Ukrainian military to hand over land that its troops have fought and died to keep would be a hard sell.</p><p>Same too, the proposed limitation on Ukraine’s armed forces. Although set at a maximum of 600,000-strong in the US plan, European officials say they fear it would leave the country vulnerable to future attack.</p><p>But Washington, seemingly even more determined to force through a peace deal, has made it clear it expects Ukraine to comply, threatening to withdraw US military support for Kyiv and to essentially abandon the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – in the words of President Trump – “to fight his little heart out.”</p><p>In a statement on Sunday night from Washington, the White House said that the Ukrainians believe the latest draft of the peace proposals “reflects their national security interests,” after various revisions and clarifications made with input from top US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva.</p><p>“The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal concerns – security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty – were thoroughly addressed during the meeting,” the statement said.</p><p>The 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine, annotated</p><p>And it’s not just the White House that appears to be talking up the Geneva negotiations. Earlier, the Ukrainian delegation head Yermak, heaped praise on the talks, calling them “very productive.”</p><p>“We have had very good progress and we are moving forward to a just and lasting peace,” Yermak added, standing alongside Rubio in an earlier press briefing.</p><p>Even some Europeans – who had previously expressed concern at being sidelined at the talks in Geneva – seemed to praise their outcome. The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the talks produced a “decisive success” for Europe.</p><p>“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan,” Wadephul told the German Deutschlandfunk radio station.</p><p>There have been some words of caution, such as from the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart before commenting on X that “negotiations were a step forward but there are still major issues to be resolved.”</p><p>But even if the current draft US peace proposal, which Rubio called a changeable “living, breathing document” does indeed now work for the US, Ukraine and it’s European backers, it is very possible that it would no longer work for the Kremlin, which has consistently refused to back down from its maximalist demands.</p><p>And Moscow has so far faced limited US pressure to do so.</p><p>In Geneva, Rubio repeatedly side-stepped my attempts to ask him whether the US would also expect Russia, not just Ukraine, to make any significant concessions.</p><p>But if the White House is actually serious about achieving what it now calls “a durable, comprehensive peace” in Ukraine, somehow convincing the Kremlin to compromise may be its best bet.</p><p>This story has been updated with additional developments.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A weakened Ukrainian president can now easily be turned into a scapegoat for defeat.</p><p>By Leonid Ragozin</p><p>Leonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Riga.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>On November 10, the Ukrainian anticorruption authorities revealed that close associates of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were allegedly involved in a scheme to embezzle $100m from Ukraine’s energy sector.</p><p>Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.</p><p>The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.</p><p>Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.</p><p>What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.</p><p>Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.</p><p>That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.</p><p>It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.</p><p>The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.</p><p>Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.</p><p>It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.</p><p>To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.</p><p>The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.</p><p>But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.</p><p>He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.</p><p>A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.</p><p>The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"A corruption scandal may well end the war in Ukraine","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/23/a-corruption-scandal-may-well-end-the-war-in-ukraine","message":"","updatedAt":"23 Nov 2025"}
{"details":"<p>One Monday in mid-October, after a year in US immigration detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.</p><p>They told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.</p><p>Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.</p><p>When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.</p><p>Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.</p><p>Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p>A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, which was a central plank of Trump's winning re-election campaign, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers.</p><p>In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.</p><p>Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.</p><p>Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.</p><p>\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"</p><p>For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.</p><p>Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.</p><p>Converts from Islam make up a significant share of Iran's estimated 800,000 Christian population, says Steve Dew-Jones of Article 18, a UK-based advocacy group that monitors violations against Christians in the country.</p><p>With officially recognised churches tightly restricted, house churches have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.</p><p>Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.</p><p>Arrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.</p><p>Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.</p><p>But it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.</p><p>\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"</p><p>Asylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.</p><p>In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.</p><p>After their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"</p><p>Pastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.</p><p>He says they entered legally through a humanitarian programme and had work authorisations. \"How can it be dangerous for the wife but not for the husband?\" asks pastor, Ara Torosian, who himself fled Iran in 2010 after being detained for smuggling Bibles.</p><p>Majid, who managed to slip through the airport in Turkey, has been living in limbo since, while his lawyer follows up on his case. His wife, whose asylum case is still pending, now lives in Los Angeles with their 1.5-year-old daughter - a child who has never met her father.</p><p>In the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.</p><p>\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran? If they deport me, I could go to prison the moment I land.\"</p><p>Unable to work legally or open a bank account. He first stayed with a distant relative \"just until my wife's case was resolved,\" but she was never released and, after nearly a year in detention, was deported. A small church later offered him temporary shelter.</p><p>\"Anytime they ask me to leave, I have to sleep in parks,\" he says.</p><p>He is awaiting an immigration hearing but sees no good outcome. His wife has received another summons from Iranian intelligence.</p><p>\"If they arrest her and demand I return,\" he says quietly, \"I'll have no choice.\"</p><p>Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.</p><p>According to the United States Geological Survey, this is the 37th eruption episode since December 2024.</p><p>Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, says she was diagnosed shortly after giving birth in 2024 and has less than a year to live.</p><p>The Church of England is grappling with what to do about followers of the far-right figure embracing faith.</p><p>While the US escalates a military threat in nearby waters, Venezuelans say the real enemy of the people is a sharp rise in food prices.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Top diplomats from the US, EU and Ukraine are meeting in Geneva to discuss Donald Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia.</p><p>By Yashraj Sharma</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Top United States officials are holding talks with Ukrainian and European diplomats in Geneva to discuss US President Donald Trump’s peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>But the so-called 28-point plan pushed by the Trump administration has alarmed Ukraine and its European allies, who see it as a capitulation to Russian demands, particularly territorial concessions and limits on the size of Ukraine’s military.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Trump had set a November 27 deadline for Ukraine to accept his peace plan, but after pushback from European leaders, Washington appears to have softened its stance, with Trump saying the plan did not represent a “final offer” for Ukraine.</p><p>This will likely create some wriggle room for diplomacy at the high-stakes talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>So, why are Ukraine’s European allies opposed to the draft plan? Who’s participating? What’s on the agenda in Geneva? And does the plan favour Moscow?</p><p>The talks are an attempt to reconcile the contentious draft peace plan, as Kyiv and its European allies want Kyiv’s long-term security interests protected.</p><p>Representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will join top US officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss how to end the war – Europe’s deadliest since World War II. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there will also be a Russian presence.</p><p>The talks, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, “could be the most decisive moment for Ukraine”.</p><p>“There is a great deal of anxiety among Ukrainians and Europeans about the nature of the 28-plan drafted by the Americans,” said Ahelbarra, reporting from Geneva.</p><p>“The concerns are about the territorial concessions: We’re talking about Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which the Ukrainians, as per the plan, have to give up in exchange for the potential of a permanent deal with Russia. They have to freeze the front lines, particularly in Kherson and Zaporizhia.</p><p>“The third element is the reduction of the capacity of the Ukrainian armed forces from 900,000 soldiers to 600,000, and this is widely perceived by the Ukrainians as a major concession they cannot afford to make,” Ahelbarra said.</p><p>In a post on X on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hopes “there will be a result”.</p><p>“The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I am awaiting the results of today’s talks and hope that all participants will be constructive. We all need a positive outcome.”</p><p>The US’s Rubio and Witkoff are leading the Geneva talks, which will also include US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.</p><p>Nine Ukrainian officials are attending the talks, including Ukraine’s presidential office chief Andriy Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, who have been empowered to deal directly with Russia by the president.</p><p>National security advisers from the E3 alliance of France, Britain and Germany will also join the discussions, alongside other officials from the EU, including Italy.</p><p>Ukraine’s European allies say the current peace plan does not address Ukraine’s security concerns. They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.</p><p>She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.</p><p>“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>On the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, European and other Western leaders pushed back against Trump’s plan, saying it required “additional work”.</p><p>“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has since captured large parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region. Moscow had annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.</p><p>According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</p><p>The proposed plan would also see Ukraine cut its army and renounce its ambitions to join NATO, which has been a major sticking point in the earlier proposals. The size of the Ukrainian armed forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.</p><p>“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during the G20 summit briefing. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”</p><p>Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.</p><p>Speaking with reporters ahead of the G20 summit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.</p><p>In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.</p><p>Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.</p><p>EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”</p><p>But US Vice President JD Vance has rebuked criticism of the peace plan.</p><p>“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”</p><p>Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was trying to defend its sovereignty while retaining the support of its most important ally, the United States. Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.</p><p>“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.</p><p>In a 10-minute speech outside the presidential palace, Zelenskyy said that if his country follows through on the proposed plan, it would leave Kyiv “without freedom, dignity and justice”.</p><p>Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will propose alternatives,” said the Ukrainian president. He then referred to the Russian invasion in February 2022, saying: “We did not betray Ukraine then, we will not do so now.”</p><p>On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.</p><p>“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p><p>European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.</p><p>A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.</p><p>“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.</p><p>However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.”</p><p>Later, a US Department of State spokesperson said Rounds’s account of his conversation with Rubio was “blatantly false”.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, said Washington’s 28-point plan could “lay the foundation for a final peace settlement”.</p><p>Putin also threatened to seize more territory if Ukraine does not accept the proposal, warning that the reported capture of the Ukrainian city of Kupiansk “will inevitably be repeated in other key areas of the front line”.</p><p>Speaking from Kyiv, journalist Audrey MacAlpine said Russia has been making battlefield gains in regions of Ukraine where the peace proposal would hand it territory along the line of contact.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera that Moscow had carried out overnight attacks on Kherson and Zaporizhia, two regions where Russia would gain de facto control under the 28-point plan being discussed in Geneva.</p><p>“No doubt Russia is trying to make gains in these particular regions, and they’ve been successful,” she said. “They’ve been making slow but concerted gains.”</p><p>We do not know yet.</p><p>During his presidential campaign leading up to the 2024 US election, Trump claimed that he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within a day. But a deal proved elusive despite Washington’s diplomatic push.</p><p>Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has made resolving foreign conflicts central to US foreign policy. He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.</p><p>But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.</p><p>Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting. But his attempt to organise a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not materialised.</p><p>In August, Trump warned Russia of severe consequences if Putin refused to end the war.

{"details":"<p>The US-brokered proposal requires Kyiv to make territorial concessions to Russia and to stay out of NATO.</p><p>By Sarah Shamim</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>The United States has revealed all 28 points of its proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The plan, which has been heavily criticised as far too favourable to Russia by many observers, is in its draft stage and has yet to be made public. However, a Ukrainian official is understood to have provided the details to international media.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Here is a closer look at the points and the significance of this plan.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed.</p><p>2. A comprehensive, non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. All ambiguities of the last 30 years will be considered settled.</p><p>3. It is expected that Russia will not invade neighbouring countries and NATO will not expand further.</p><p>4. A dialogue will be held between Russia and NATO, mediated by the US, to resolve all security issues and create conditions for de-escalation to ensure global security and increase opportunities for cooperation and future economic development.</p><p>5. Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees.</p><p>6. The size of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be limited to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>7. Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO, and NATO agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.</p><p>8. NATO agrees not to station troops in Ukraine.</p><p>9. European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland.</p><p>10. The US security guarantee will have the following caveats:</p><p>11. Ukraine is eligible for European Union (EU) membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the EU market while this issue is being considered.</p><p>12. A powerful global package of measures will be provided to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:</p><p>13. Russia will be reintegrated into the global economy:</p><p>14. Frozen funds will be used as follows:</p><p>15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.</p><p>16. Russia will enshrine in law its policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine.</p><p>17. The US and Russia will agree to extend the validity of treaties on the non-proliferation and control of nuclear weapons, including the START I Treaty.</p><p>18. Ukraine agrees to be a non-nuclear state in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</p><p>19. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant will be launched under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the electricity produced will be distributed equally between Russia and Ukraine, 50:50.</p><p>20. Both countries undertake to implement educational programmes in schools and society aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance of different cultures and eliminating racism and prejudice:</p><p>21. Territories:</p><p>22. After agreeing on future territorial arrangements, both the Russian Federation and Ukraine undertake not to change these arrangements by force. Any security guarantees will not apply in the event of a breach of this commitment.</p><p>23. Russia will not prevent Ukraine from using the Dnipro River for commercial activities, and agreements will be reached on the free transport of grain across the Black Sea.</p><p>24. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:</p><p>25. Ukraine will hold elections in 100 days.</p><p>26. All parties involved in this conflict will receive full amnesty for their actions during the war and agree not to make any claims or consider any complaints in the future.</p><p>27. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by the Peace Council, headed by President Donald J Trump. Sanctions will be imposed for violations.</p><p>28. Once all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to the agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Zelenskyy met with US Army officials in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss the proposals, which have been drawn up by US and Russian officials without any input from Ukraine or its European allies.</p><p>After the meeting, Zelenskyy said in an address: “The American side presented points of a plan to end the war – their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it’s all genuine.”</p><p>Zelenskyy added, “From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace – one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace – with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”</p><p>The Ukrainian president said that he will now discuss the proposals with Ukraine’s European allies.</p><p>No.</p><p>“Zelenskyy had a nuanced response – he said ‘We will work on it’,” Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert at the London political think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, he added that agreeing to the terms of the plan in its current form would be “catastrophic” for Ukraine because of the heavy concessions Kyiv is being asked to make.</p><p>While European leaders have not reacted to the 28-point plan, they have indicated that they would not accept a plan that requires Ukraine to make such concessions.</p><p>“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”</p><p>For now, Ukraine’s allies are not commenting. European Council President Antonio Costa said that the EU has not yet been officially informed about the US plan, so “it makes no sense to comment” on it.</p><p>More reactions from Europe might come starting from Saturday, when Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak at the G20 summit.</p><p>“A 28-point plan was made public. We will discuss the situation both with European leaders and with leaders here on the sidelines of the G20,” von der Leyen said, according to UK media.</p><p>The US has not made details of the plan public, and officials from Washington have not commented on it.</p><p>Russia has denied that there have been formal consultations between the US and Russia on a peace plan.</p><p>“Consultations are not currently under way. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hungarian PM and close Trump ally Viktor Orban seemed to back the plan on Friday.</p><p>In an X post, Orban wrote that Trump’s plan had “gained new momentum”.</p><p>“The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time, the war would never have broken out. It is clear that once he sets his mind on something, he does not let it go, and he has certainly set his mind on ending the Russian-Ukrainian war,” Orban wrote.</p><p>President @realDonaldTrump's peace initiative has gained new momentum. A 28-point peace plan is on the table, an American negotiating delegation is in Kyiv, and expectations are high worldwide. The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time,… pic.twitter.com/J2cagATvc5</p><p>— Orbán Viktor (@PM_ViktorOrban) November 21, 2025</p><p></p><p>Experts said the terms of the 28-point plan and how they would be implemented are far from clear.</p><p>“The terms are unenforceable, nonsensical and vague that they cannot be enforced without months of wrangling,” Giles said.</p><p>For instance, he said, point 9 states that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. However, it is unclear what “European” or “fighter jets” mean.</p><p>Giles said “European” could mean the European Union or European countries. “‘Fighter jets’ is a militarily meaningless term, which provides plenty of room for argument,” he added.</p><p>It is unclear what security guarantees the US is offering Ukraine. Further details of these have not been released.</p><p>Point 10 states that the “US will receive compensation for the guarantee”. While it is unclear what the specific compensation would be, experts suggest that point 14 may shed some light on this.</p><p>Point 14 of the plan states that $100bn in frozen Russian assets plus $100bn from Europe would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction.</p><p>The plan further states that the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is not specified how these profits would be generated.</p><p>The plan also states that remaining Russian funds would go into a joint US-Russia investment vehicle for projects to build ties and deter future conflict, again with little detail.</p><p>Giles said this likely refers to about $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets, which have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>In October this year, EU leaders suggested a “reparations plan” under which it would use frozen Russian assets to lend Ukraine $164bn to buy European weapons, and for reconstruction.</p><p>Giles said that the point about Russian frozen assets was likely deliberately added by negotiators from Moscow because “Russia has already written off frozen assets abroad, and now is dangling that as a carrot in front of the US”.</p><p>Giles added that, according to earlier plans, however, “those funds were supposed to rebuild Ukraine”.</p><p>However, now we don’t know whether the reconstruction will be of a “free Ukraine or Russian efforts of Russification in occupied Ukraine”, he said.</p><p>Point 26 of the plan states that all parties involved in the conflict will receive “full amnesty for their actions during the war”.</p><p>In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.</p><p>The US cannot unilaterally grant amnesty to an individual convicted of war crimes by an international organisation.</p><p>“Writing off the war, pretending it never happened, rolling back sanctions and ignoring war crimes is just one of the elements of this draft list where the US is assuming the cooperation of the rest of the world,” Giles said.</p><p>He added that a large number of countries across the world strongly believe in international law, and are likely to push back on this point.</p><p>“If a negotiation like this were to be enforced, then it is the US endorsing the seizure of territory through open arms aggression, and it will be encouragement to other aggressors around the world that they have the US blessing,” Giles warned.</p><p>The plan says that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be considered Russian territory.</p><p>Donetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas region.</p><p>Crimea was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and remains a matter of dispute.</p><p>According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas, including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p><p>Russia also controls 75 percent of Zaporizhia and Kherson in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. The plan says that the current battle lines will be frozen in these regions.</p><p>Parts of the proposal aim to bring Russia out of the isolation imposed on it by the Western world since it started the Ukraine war.</p><p>Point 12 states that Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.</p><p>The G8 – currently the G7 – was an unofficial forum for the leaders of eight major industrialised nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US.</p><p>Russia was part of the G8 but was ejected following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p><p>The plan also mentions the establishment of a US-Russian investment vehicle that would implement joint projects in specific areas. However, further details about this have not been revealed.</p><p>The plan also mentions the formation of a joint US-Russian working group on security issues to ensure compliance with the plan.</p><p>Analysts are doubtful. “This agreement is not going anywhere – similar to the previous ones,” Giles said.</p><p>He called it “another iteration of the merry-go-round that we’ve been on many times before”.</p><p>He said he believes the plan will receive pushback from Ukraine and Europe, which will want to negotiate changes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Trump’s 28-point Ukraine plan in full: What it means, could it work?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work","message":"","updatedAt":"21 Nov 2025Updated: 21 Nov 2025 12:38 PM (GMT)"}

Everyone is belted in, including the dog. Now the adventure begins.</p><p>The road trip is a great American pastime. The slideshow of landscapes, from prairie to forest to city. The spontaneous stops for homemade pie or tacky souvenirs. The ocean air or evergreen scents wafting through the open windows (okay, it’s more likely asphalt).</p><p>Everything is going well — until it’s not. The driver is tired. The kids are fighting. Someone is asking for another bathroom break. Many of these incidents could be avoided, if only we all agreed on some ground rules.</p><p>So, we compiled 33 tips and tenets that will make sure every trip is epic, with smooth roads ahead and only the best memories in the rearview mirror.</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>Start with a clean car. While you are at it, check all the levels. Check your tire pressure. Change your windshield wipers if you know they’re on their last legs.</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>That little pine tree dangling from the mirror might look cute, but it’s a big no for road trip purposes. For the scent-sensitive, any kind of artificial smell could mean an instant headache and miserable drive.</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>Does someone want to nap while someone else drives, then switch places? Or does one driver want to power through all day? Whatever floats your boat. Just make sure everyone is on the same page from the get-go.</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>In the car, the seating order is determined by age — adults in the front, kiddos in the back — and height (long legs come with privileges). Youngest and smallest go in the middle seat.</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>Helmholtz Resonance is not the name of a cool new band. It’s the throbbing hum that occurs when you drive fast with the windows open. So shut ’em and crank up Social Distortion instead.</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>Check the route. Determine the best exits for meals, restrooms and any along-the-way sights ahead of time so you’re not making hangry decisions on the fly.</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>Around the time they get their license, every driver should have to acquaint themselves with a jack, a tire iron, lug nuts and little backup doughnut tires. They’ll come in handy one day.</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>Yes, the car has more storage than an overhead bin. But remember that the space in the back is not all yours. Keep a smaller bag with essentials close by so no one has to dig through the luggage mountain to get to your magazine.</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>What the driver says goes. There shall be no debate over music, temperature settings or wacky roadside attraction stops. Got a problem with that? Well, do you want to drive?</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>The driver has one job: to drive without distraction. Leave the auxiliary activities — navigation, Spotify playlists, Buc-ee’s mile countdowns — to the passengers. Absolutely no texting and driving. And no drinking (duh).</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>For the sake of your fellow passengers alone, take a deep breath. Somebody cut you off? Put “the bird” away and wish them a nice day.</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>You’re the driver’s right hand, the first level of defense against distraction and discomfort. This means you have to navigate, play DJ upon request, change the temperature and generally be an extra set of hands. Don’t be shocked if you’re asked to feed the driver a grape.</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>Sorry you get carsick, but if you’re about to hurl, you better say something. Make your condition known at the start of the trip, maybe sit shotgun if that helps, and stay! off! your! phone! If you do start to feel nauseous, give the driver a heads up ASAP so you can pull over before the point of no return.</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>Everyone must try to use the restroom at scheduled stops. If nature calls at other times, just say the word to be accommodated — but make sure to give fair warning.</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>You had your chance, so hold it and avoid looking at waterfalls.</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>Keep your opinions and shrieks to yourself. The driver is the boss here, remember?</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>You are not the only person cramped in this car. Resist the urge to ask “Are we there yet?”</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>In a perfect world, everyone would board the car with devices fully charged. But you should still pass the charging cable when someone’s phone needs a boost. If you’re the kind of person who gets nervous when your battery life dips below 50 percent, consider bringing your own portable charger on board.</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>The sun warming your head and the wind ruffling your hair might feel glorious to one traveler but torturous to another. All in favor of an open sunroof, say “aye.”</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>Yes, engage and entertain young passengers with all the I Spy games and “Wheels on the Bus” rounds you can handle. Pack knickknacks and crafts galore. But if all else fails, this is a fine time to let the kids watch “Bluey” to their hearts’ content.</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>It may be comfortable to stretch out. But resist the urge to rest those tootsies on the dash: If the air bag were to deploy, it could cause serious injuries. The folks over at MythBusters even used a crash dummy to illustrate the risk.</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>For your safety and your pet’s, the front seat — including your lap — should be a dog-free zone. Use a harness, travel carrier or car seat — with a booster if Buster is tiny.</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>There is a time and a place for Whoppers and Combos. This is it. Stock up accordingly, and bring enough to share.</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>Before you crack open the container of pickled eggs, ask yourself: is this snack going to stink up the car? Unless you have group consensus, save your fragrant food for pit stops. Here are some better options.</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>If you’re going to inflict fast food on your body, you better be sure it’s worth it. Don’t just take the first exit after your stomach grumbles. Know your personal junk food rankings, taking into account independent unicorns and regional chains. Nobody wants stale fries. But a Cook Out milkshake? Revelatory.</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>Formal table manners have no place inside a car. You have permission to eat all food groups with your hands and wipe your fingers on your pants.</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>These are precious real estate. If you have several beverages, you should stack, combine or chug them.</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>Don’t you dare chuck trash out the window. Circulate a communal trash bag and toss it (in a bin, please) whenever it reaches capacity.</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>This is not the time to live dangerously, Kramer! Don’t let your gas dip below a quarter tank, let alone push the limits of E.</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>It’s a dirty job, but someone’s got to do it. It would be nice if that someone weren’t the driver, who deserves a little break from responsibility.</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>The driver might not let you contribute, but it’s polite to offer. This applies to tolls and filling station snacks, too.</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>Yes, someone will pump your gas for you. No, do not tip. In the lone Full-Service State, the custom is to thank the gas station attendant with words not cash.</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>It’s your last act, so end the trip with a solid dismount. Park near the hotel, not in another Zip code. Find a real spot, not a gap in the bike lane. If you are still circling after 15 minutes, find a garage or drop off your passengers and the luggage. You better know how to parallel park.</p><p>About this story</p><p>Editing by Gabe Hiatt and Amanda Finnegan. Design editing by Christine Ashack. Design and development by Katty Huertas.

{"details":"<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene came into Congress as one of Donald Trump's staunchest defenders.</p><p>Sworn into office just days before the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, Greene supported the president - and echoed his contention that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" - when many in the Republican Party disavowed him.</p><p>Now, five years later, Greene will leave Congress having been branded a \"traitor\" by the man she once revered.</p><p>Over the course of just a handful of months, Greene broke with Trump in the most dramatic fashion.</p><p>Although Greene had criticised Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran, his support for Israel during the Gaza War and a lack of sufficient regulation of big technology companies earlier this year, the final fracture began over Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile who had connections to the wealthy and powerful.</p><p>She condemned Trump's unwillingness to order his justice department to fully release its files on the case, and appeared alongside Epstein's victims – and Democrats - to force a House vote on the matter.</p><p>It didn't end there, however.</p><p>Greene would also question Republican strategy during the recent government shutdown, siding with Democrats in calling on her party to address expiring healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans.</p><p>She publicly berated Trump for what she said was an undue emphasis on foreign policy at the expense of addressing economic and affordability concerns.</p><p>\"The American people aren't motivated by foreign wars or bailouts for other countries,\" she wrote on X earlier this month. \"They want leaders who show up, do the job, and fight for them every single day!\"</p><p>Greene continued to insist that she supported Trump, but it became increasingly clear that she has a view of the \"America First\" movement that differs from the US president's.</p><p>An activist turned congresswoman who made her name railing against the political establishment had now found that the Maga – \"Make America Great Again\" - movement she supported had become the establishment.</p><p>And as the weight of Trump's power focused on her ouster – she broke for the exits with a few parting shots.</p><p>\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better,\" she said in her resignation statement.</p><p>\"If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.\"</p><p>Throughout her career, she often embraced controversy and leaned into conflict.</p><p>A gym instructor in Georgia, she began engaging in politics in 2016, as Trump started his successful campaign for the White House. She made frequent trips to Washington DC, where she would berate Democratic members of Congress for what she said were their socialist and pro-Islam policies.</p><p>She promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, questioning whether shootings in a US school were \"staged\" and alleging that the Democratic party was secretly run by a group of powerful paedophiles.</p><p>Once in Congress, she clashed with Democrats - and members of her own party. Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the House voted to remove her from her committee assignments shortly after she took office.</p><p>When Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson, and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well.</p><p>In 2023, she was expelled from the conservative House Freedom Caucus.</p><p>She had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington.</p><p>And then she didn't.</p><p>In a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene's departure from Congress was \"great news for the country\".</p><p>He would later post on Truth Social that Greene \"went bad\" but that he would \"always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to our country\".</p><p>Greene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a \"new path ahead\". Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state's governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.</p><p>Her decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without Trump's support.</p><p>The move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never appear on a presidential ballot again.</p><p>At 51, Greene's tenure in Congress may be at an end, but her involvement in American political life may be far from over.</p><p>Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.</p><p>According to the United States Geological Survey, this is the 37th eruption episode since December 2024.</p><p>Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, says she was diagnosed shortly after giving birth in 2024 and has less than a year to live.</p><p>While the US escalates a military threat in nearby waters, Venezuelans say the real enemy of the people is a sharp rise in food prices.</p><p>US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>• US Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted “tremendous progress” in today’s talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, saying the sticking points on the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine peace proposal are “not insurmountable.” Ukraine has also said the delegations made good progress.</p><p>• It remains to be seen if Moscow would sign on to the terms being hammered out between Washington and Kyiv. Trump’s original 28-point peace plan had been widely considered favorable to Russia and was met with concern from European allies.</p><p>• Even as the talks progressed, President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukraine’s leaders this morning, claiming they have “expressed zero gratitude” for his efforts to end the war. Ukraine’s president has repeatedly thanked the US publicly. Rubio later signaled that those tensions had been smoothed over and said Trump is “pleased” with the progress.</p><p>Our live coverage has ended. Get the latest here.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has departed Geneva, Switzerland, and is heading back to Washington, DC, following high-level meetings on a peace plan for Ukraine, a senior State Department official said today.</p><p>Rubio indicated that discussions would continue on a technical level as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”</p><p>It’s not clear whether other US officials have left Geneva, though Rubio said earlier that “we have all kinds of people at technical levels that are working full time on this and engaged in this full time.”</p><p>Earlier today, Rubio heralded “tremendous progress” following meetings with Ukrainian officials to end the war, calling the discussions “the most productive day in the entirety of our efforts.”</p><p>The final agreement, he noted, will require sign-off from US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia will also need to sign off on the plan.</p><p>The White House said today that the Ukrainians believe the current draft of a peace plan to end the war “reflects their national security interests,” after “revisions and clarifications” were made with input from top US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>A draft 28-point plan had faced criticism for appearing to favor Russia. But the White House said in a statement today that Ukraine’s key concerns were “thoroughly addressed” and “today marked a significant step forward.”</p><p>“The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting,” the statement said.</p><p></p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had praised the “substantive” results from the meeting. “Much is changing: We are working very carefully on the steps needed to end the war,” he said in a video address posted on Telegram.</p><p>Separately, Ukraine also expressed its gratitude toward the US and President Donald Trump in a joint statement released by the White House.</p><p>“The Ukrainian delegation reaffirmed its gratitude for the steadfast commitment of the United States and, personally, President Donald J. Trump for their tireless efforts aimed at ending the war and the loss of life,” the statement said.</p><p></p><p>Just this morning, Trump lashed out at Ukrainian leadership for what he called a lack of gratitude, and it seems the Ukrainians have responded, in kind, with several mentions of thanks to the US and Trump.</p><p>Zelensky posted on X that “Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump” for assistance that has saved Ukrainian lives.</p><p>Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak told reporters, “We thank our big friends, United States, and personally President Trump and his team to their commitment to bring this peace.”</p><p>The draft of the Trump administration’s 28-point Ukraine peace plan that has been viewed publicly amounts to a surrender, Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today.</p><p>“My thoughts is that this is not a peace plan, it’s a surrender plan,” Meeks told CNN’s Jessica Dean.</p><p></p><p>The New York Democrat accused the Trump administration of essentially giving “Russia more than Russia would’ve asked for.” Meanwhile, Moscow will give up “absolutely nothing,” he claimed.</p><p>Meeks said the deal sends the wrong message to European allies.</p><p>“If we do this to Ukraine, then what does that mean for the rest of NATO? Because that means Putin can continue to go wherever he wants, knowing that the United States of America may not have their back,” he said.</p><p></p><p>Key context: The original draft of the Trump administration’s proposal has been widely criticized for being too favorable to Russia, as it would concede many long-standing Kremlin demands.</p><p>After talks in Geneva today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed that the proposal is a “living, breathing document” that is shifting in response to input from Ukraine and other parties. Rubio said “the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” and the Ukrainian delegation also emerged from the talks with a positive assessment.</p><p>The current outline of the proposal — and whether it’s one Moscow would ever sign on to — remains to be seen.</p><p>Watch the interview with Meeks:</p><p>CNN’s Kit Maher, Svitlana Vlasova and Mitchell McCluskey contributed to this post.</p><p>Top US diplomats and Ukrainian officials are expressing optimism after holding talks in Geneva today, though it remains to be seen if Moscow would sign on to the terms the two sides have been discussing.</p><p>The positive messaging came despite President Donald Trump lashing out at Kyiv’s leaders this morning, claiming they have “expressed zero gratitude” for his efforts to end the war with Russia, despite many examples to the contrary.</p><p>If you’re just joining us, here’s the latest on the talks and potential peace plan:</p><p>CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova, Mitchell McCluskey, Kit Maher, Nina Subkhanberdina and Betsy Klein contributed to this post.</p><p>Europe’s E3 powers of Britain, France and Germany created a counter-proposal to the United States’ 28-point Ukraine peace plan, according to Reuters, which saw the text on Sunday.</p><p>The text was confirmed as accurate by one European official and one European diplomatic source speaking to CNN’s chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>One of those officials said the text was an accurate reflection of European bids to change the US draft proposal, but that further alterations could have been made during fast-moving talks in Geneva today.</p><p>Here’s how the plan differs: Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was a softening of the language around restricting NATO in Europe.</p><p>The European version also removed mention of territorial concessions. The regions of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk were all explicitly recognized as de facto Russian in the US plan. In the new European proposal, all recognitions of Russian control are removed. It demands a ceasefire before determining territorial swaps, and that the current front line be the basis for any future discussions.</p><p>The Europeans also removed the 100-day deadline for elections in Ukraine, instead saying elections will be held as soon as possible after the signing of the peace agreement.</p><p>The European proposal removes all references to US-Russia investment structures, shifting toward an approach where Russia pays reparations to Ukraine.</p><p>It also said the size of Ukraine’s military would be “capped at 800,000 in peacetime,” which is the amount of military personnel it currently has, compared to limit of 600,000 stated in the US-plan.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the “substantive” results from diplomatic discussions held today in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Much is changing: We are working very carefully on the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel this evening.</p><p>As the delegates headed into today’s talks, US President Donald Trump had accused the Ukrainians of showing insufficient gratitude for US efforts — echoing a past criticism that’s at odds with Kyiv’s public record of thanking US leaders.</p><p>But Zelensky said “there are signs that President Trump’s team is listening” to their side.</p><p>“Diplomacy has been activated, which is good,” Zelensky said. “The first priority is reliable peace, guaranteed security, respect for our people, respect for everyone who gave their lives defending Ukraine from Russian aggression.”</p><p></p><p>He also urged Ukrainians not to send “conflicting signals” and to maintain unity in their messaging.</p><p>The Ukrainian president held discussions with several world leaders today, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and the prime ministers of Canada, Croatia and Luxembourg.</p><p>You can watch a portion of Zelensky’s comments below:</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated Sunday that the Thursday deadline set by President Donald Trump for Ukraine to accept the United States’ peace proposal is fluid.</p><p>“The deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible. Obviously, you know, we would love it to be Thursday. … We’ve really moved forward, so I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon,” Rubio said in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p></p><p>“Whether it’s Thursday, whether it’s Friday, whether it’s Wednesday, whether it’s Monday of the following week, we want it to be soon, because people are going to die,” Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio said the US recognizes that Ukraine needs to have security guarantees as part of a peace proposal, but he did not delve into specifics of what was discussed.</p><p>“I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel as it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again,” Rubio said.</p><p>While Rubio said it’s “possible” a call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky could occur later, he said was unsure.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the 28-point peace plan for the end of the war in Ukraine continues to change with input from the parties involved, calling the moment “very delicate.”</p><p>“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” Rubio said, later adding: “I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today.”</p><p></p><p>Russia was not involved in Sunday’s talks in Geneva, Switzerland, between the US and Ukraine.</p><p>Rubio declined to get into the specifics when pressed by CNN’s Matthew Chance on whether the Ukrainians have indicated they are prepared to compromise, given that it’s “an ongoing process.”</p><p>“Just because it’s printed on a piece of paper doesn’t indicate finality, so you get input, and based on that input, you make adjustments and then you get more input,” Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio noted that “the Russians get a vote here” and will be consulted in the next step toward peace.</p><p>“Obviously, we now have to take what we come up with — if we can reach that agreement with the Ukrainian side — to the Russian side,” he said.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Sunday that he conveyed to President Donald Trump that talks with Ukrainian officials were “very positive” and that the president is “pleased” with the progress.</p><p>“It was very positive — I’m telling you today was the most productive,” Rubio said upon conclusion of Sunday’s discussions in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Pressed by CNN’s Matthew Chance on Trump’s comments earlier in the day lashing out at Ukraine for what the president described as a lack of gratitude, Rubio signaled those tensions had been smoothed over.</p><p>Trump said in a social media post earlier that “Ukraine’s ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts.”</p><p>Rubio said he had subsequently spoken with the president.</p><p>“Today — and we’ve talked to him since — I think he’s quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made,” he said.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio heralded “tremendous progress” following diplomatic talks with Ukrainian officials to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, calling Sunday’s discussions “the most productive day in the entirety of our efforts.”</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, Rubio touted “extensive engagement” from Ukraine on the US-backed 28-point peace plan, which is widely considered favorable to Russia.</p><p>Going into the talks, he said, there was “one goal” — to “try to narrow” the disagreements around key points.</p><p>“We have achieved that today in a very substantial way,” Rubio said.</p><p>The final agreement, he noted, will require sign-off from US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia will also need to sign off on the plan to end the nearly four-year war.</p><p>There are still some sticking points, Rubio said, characterizing the outstanding issues as “a couple issues that we need to continue to work on.”</p><p>“I don’t want to declare victory or finality here. There’s still some work to be done, but we are much further ahead today, at this time, than we were when we began this morning,” he said.</p><p></p><p>We heard from both the US and Ukrainian delegations after the early session of talks in Geneva, with each side projecting optimism.</p><p>In case you missed it, here’s US Secretary of State Marco Rubio first. Rubio described the meeting as the “most productive and meaningful” so far:</p><p>And here’s Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian presidential office, who also said the sides were making progress today:</p><p>We may hear more from the two sides this evening, and we’ll have updates for you as we learn more.</p><p>President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is part of the US delegation meeting with Ukrainian officials in Geneva.</p><p>Kushner has played a key role at times in US diplomacy in the Middle East and elsewhere during Trump’s first and second term.</p><p>The Trump administration has been rushing to move forward a deal to end the war in Ukraine in the weeks since a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which Kushner also helped broker.</p><p>The delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Other members include special envoy Steve Witkoff, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, State Department counselor Mike Needham, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Alexis Grynkewich, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, and the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Julie Davis.</p><p>It’s been a rollercoaster 24 hours — with confusion and uncertainty among Ukrainian and European diplomats on whether Washington’s 28-point peace plan was final or marked the basis for further negotiation.</p><p>Earlier in the day, when I asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio whether the US would turn its back on Ukraine if it rejected the peace proposal, Rubio stormed past, stony-faced.</p><p>Hours later, he came out to speak to the press — alongside Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak — and seemed more upbeat. Both Rubio and Yermak were speaking of progress and appeared to be in a positive frame of mind.</p><p>Intensive face-to-face negotiations are now continuing into the evening here in Geneva with US and Ukrainian officials indicating they may have more to say on the outcome of the talks later tonight.</p><p>But the big question remains whether the process underway right now may be the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine or yet another performative dead end.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his call for a strong and lasting peace as US and Ukrainian delegations hold talks in Geneva.</p><p>Zelensky said the “crux of the entire diplomatic situation” is that Russia has refused to end its invasion.</p><p>“Putin has been waging this war with complete disregard for how many of his own people he loses and how many of ours he kills,” Zelensky wrote in an X post today.</p><p>The Ukrainian leader said he was grateful to President Donald Trump and European leaders for engaging in discussions about the US-proposed peace deal. His comments come after Trump accused Ukraine’s leaders of showing “zero gratitude” for US assistance, despite Zelensky and others repeatedly thanking the president publicly.</p><p>“It is important not to forget the main goal — to stop Russia’s war and prevent it from ever igniting again. And to achieve that, peace must be dignified,” Zelensky said. “That is why we work so carefully on every point, on every step toward peace. Everything must work out the right way — so that this war is truly ended and so that it does not happen again.”</p><p></p><p>Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she was mostly concerned with the use of the US military on domestic soil when she recently taped a video alongside fellow Democrats advising service members to refuse illegal orders the Trump administration might issue.</p><p>“My primary concern is the use of US military on American shores, on our city, in our cities and in our streets,” Slotkin said today on ABC’s “This Week.”</p><p></p><p>Slotkin advised service members to speak to their judge advocate general officers to “ask them for explanation, for top cover, for their view on things.”</p><p>“It is very clear that no one should follow an illegal order, but it’s very murky when you look at, what is an illegal order, and if you go into morally, ethically, that’s a pretty tough thing to look at and say, ‘How do I navigate this?’” she added.</p><p>President Donald Trump reacted furiously to the video last week, suggesting the lawmakers’ actions were, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”</p><p>Slotkin criticized Trump’s response, though she said it won’t prevent her from continuing to speak her mind. “But obviously the president took issue with one sentence in a video and was calling for our death. I think that’s inappropriate,” Slotkin said.</p><p>While the president’s call to arrest the lawmakers — which he doubled down on today — has been roundly criticized by Democrats, the remarks have also attracted some rare criticism from Republicans.</p><p>GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky rebuked Trump’s rhetoric toward the six Democrats today, calling the president’s behavior “reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible” in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p><p>Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian president’s office, said the Ukrainian delegation had “a very productive first session” with US officials in Geneva today, as talks continue to bring an end to the war with Russia.</p><p>“We have very good progress, and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace. Ukrainian people deserve and want this peace more than anyone in this planet,” Yermak said alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also shared an upbeat assessment.</p><p></p><p>President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian leadership on social media this morning for what he described as a lack of gratitude. In his remarks to reporters, Yermak thanked the US president: “We thank our big friends, United States, and personally President Trump and his team for their commitment to bring this peace.”</p><p>It marked another example of the many times Ukrainian officials have publicly expressed appreciation for the administration.</p><p>Yermak said the group would continue working today and join proposals in the coming days.</p><p>“We also will engage our European friends, and of course, the final words will be of our leaders, of the President of United States and Ukraine, and I hope that we can achieve the good progress today,” Yermak said.</p><p></p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism after what he described as productive discussions between the US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva today.</p><p>“It is my personal view that we’ve had probably the most productive and meaningful meeting so far in this entire process since we’ve been involved,” Rubio told reporters in Switzerland a short time ago.</p><p></p><p>Rubio described the administration’s 28-point peace plan, which has been criticized on both sides of the aisle for its concessions to Russia, as a “very good work product,” and said it was “built on a foundation of input from all the relevant parties involved here.”</p><p>According to a draft, its provisions would include Kyiv ceding territory to Russia, giving up any ambitions to join NATO, and limiting the size of its army.</p><p>US and Ukrainian officials, Rubio said, are now meeting separately to work through some adjustments to the plan, with the hopes “of further narrowing the differences.”</p><p>Ultimately, he added, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will need to approve the plan. Rubio said he felt “very comfortable about that happening, given the progress we’ve made.”</p><p>Russia will also need to sign off on the plan.</p><p>Rubio said there would be additional updates later today.</p><p>The US says talks with Ukraine today in Geneva have been “productive and even conclusive in some areas” as they discussed President Donald Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia.</p><p>“As the day progressed, the Ukrainians and US delegation got together to have detailed discussions about the peace agreement,” a US official said. “There’s a formal meeting between the two delegations where they will be ironing out the details of the agreement,” they added.</p><p></p><p>The US-backed proposal has come under fire from critics who say it is too friendly to Russia.</p><p>While it’s important for Ukraine to iron out its differences with the US, the ultimate test will be if it can come to an agreement with Moscow.</p><p>While we await further updates on the Russia-Ukraine talks in Geneva, let’s update you on some of the other stories we’ve been reporting from Washington in the last 24 hours.</p><p>CNN’s Ali Main, Manu Raju, Auzinea Bacon, Natasha Bertrand, Avery Schmitz and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>From 10 December, social media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.</p><p>The government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\".</p><p>A study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.</p><p>One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.</p><p>The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.</p><p>It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord have recently introduced age checks on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban.</p><p>The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p>These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p>YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.</p><p>Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.</p><p>The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.</p><p>Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.</p><p>The government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.</p><p>Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has announced it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said.</p><p>Snapchat has said users can use bank accounts or photo IDs to verify their age or take a selfie, which will be used to estimate their age.</p><p>The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.</p><p>Without a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.</p><p>The government's own report found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.</p><p>Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".</p><p>Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.</p><p>Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.</p><p>Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\".</p><p>\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"</p><p>Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages.</p><p>Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.</p><p>But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches.</p><p>It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p><p>Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy.</p><p>They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.</p><p>YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.</p><p>Even as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\".</p><p>At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it.</p><p>Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.</p><p>The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p>In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p>Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a French parliamentary enquiry recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p>Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p>Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p><p>Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p>Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p>Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules.</p><p>Skye Gyngell, a former private chef to Nigella Lawson and Madonna, was diagnosed with skin cancer last year.</p><p>A Manchester nightclub that enforced a strict no-mobile phone policy puts out a reminder of the rules.</p><p>England fans \"should be better than\" the \"abuse\" they direct at Australia batter Steve Smith, says former coach Darren Lehmann.</p><p>Disgruntled England fans in Perth watch the Lions instead of day three of the First Test.

{"details":"<p>Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema’s most popular stars, whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday. He was 89.</p><p>The actor, who would have turned 90 on December 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.</p><p>A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra’s doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor’s death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.</p><p>“He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on social media platform X.</p><p>Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man,” Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India’s most iconic actors.</p><p>Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero — upright, patriotic and fearless — his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.</p><p>Dharmendra’s performance in “Sholay” (1975) — Bollywood’s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India’s greatest films — earned him enduring popularity.</p><p>His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy “Chupke Chupke” (1975) to the action drama “Mera Gaon Mera Desh” (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.</p><p>His role in Bollywood classic “Sholay,” where he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo’s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood’s most iconic pairings.</p><p>His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood’s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films.</p><p>A ‘tidal change’ in Bollywood: How the world’s largest film industry veered to the right during the Modi era</p><p>But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps — Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.</p><p>Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her.</p><p>According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.</p><p>Dharmendra and Malini had two daughters, including Bollywood actor Esha Deol. His nephew, Abhay Deol, also joined the industry.</p><p>A ‘beautiful bridge’: The unlikely love affair between Australia and Bollywood</p><p>Later in his career, Dharmendra moved to more character-driven roles, frequently portraying paternal figures in the 1990s and 2000s in a career that continued through 2025. He was last seen in war biopic film “Ikkis.”</p><p>“I never thought I would come this far,” he said in a 2021 interview with Indian news website Rediff.</p><p>Born Dharmendra Kewal Krishan Deol in India’s northern state of Punjab in 1935, he grew up in a farming family and moved to Mumbai in the late 1950s, making his Bollywood debut in 1960.</p><p>Over a career spanning six decades, he acted in more than 300 films.</p><p>In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India’s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema.</p><p>He also briefly turned to politics, serving as a Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Parliament from 2004 to 2009, though his political stint was short-lived.</p><p>Dharmendra is survived by his wives, children and grandchildren.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Garlic simmers in huge metal pots heated over open wood fires and set up in a long line.</p><p>Cooks add canned tomatoes and peppers with handfuls of spices, stirring the sauce with giant spoons.</p><p>What is being prepared here is not just lunch, it is a lifeline.</p><p>American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) opened this community kitchen in al-Zawayda in central Gaza after the ceasefire began six weeks ago.</p><p>The US humanitarian organisation has another kitchen in al-Mawasi in the south of the strip, which the BBC visited in early May.</p><p>Back then, two months into an Israeli blockade, preventing the entry of all food and other goods, stocks were dwindling.</p><p>Now, with more food allowed to enter, the situation has improved.</p><p>Each day, Anera feeds a hot meal to more than 20,000 people.</p><p>\"We have moved from using 15 pots in the past, and now we increased to up to 120 pots in a day, targeting more than 30 internally displaced people's camps,\" says team leader Sami Matar. \"We're serving more than 4,000 families compared to just 900 families six months ago.\"</p><p>Access to food has been a constant concern since the start of the war in October 2023, with Israel heavily restricting supplies allowed through Gaza's crossings.</p><p>This has exacerbated the dire humanitarian situation. Famine was confirmed in Gaza City in August and projected to spread to other areas of the strip.</p><p>The UN continues to call for more aid to be allowed in.</p><p>On the menu today is spaghetti served with canned vegetables and tomato sauce and flavoured with generous handfuls of spices. Sami gives an approving nod as he tastes a spoonful.</p><p>But while Anera is managing to get access to more food, brought into Gaza by its partner, the US humanitarian organisation World Central Kitchen, there are still vital ingredients missing to improve people's diets.</p><p>\"We are mostly confined to cooking just three types of meals in a week: rice, pasta and lentils,\" Mr Matar says. \"We work hard to include vegetables like sweet peppers, onion and potatoes. This enables us to improve the taste and the nutritional value.\"</p><p>\"We need the food to be more diverse, to secure fresh vegetables and essential proteins like meat and chicken,\" he goes on. \"Those essentials are not allowed to enter Gaza for humanitarian aid distribution.\"</p><p>For now, fresh meat and poultry are only being imported by commercial sellers. They are too expensive for aid organisations to buy locally.</p><p>Since the ceasefire, Anera has only once served a meal with meat, which came from tins. Anera says its kitchens also lack utensils, packaging and canisters of gas, with which it would be cleaner to cook.</p><p>Six months ago, when a BBC freelance journalist visited the al-Mawasi kitchen, horses and carts were being used to take pots of food to the camps.</p><p>Now, with some fuel entering Gaza once again, a small truck is used to transport the meals to where crowds are waiting for them.</p><p>The pasta is a popular choice.</p><p>A little red-haired boy squeals with delight. \"Sweetcorn and everything!\" he exclaims.</p><p>Other children grin as they immediately sit on the ground and start slurping on the spaghetti, eating it with their hands.</p><p>In the past week, the UN says that the daily number of meals distributed in Gaza through a network of kitchens, run by different organisations, has reached 1.4 million - up from fewer than one million meals just a month ago. The total population of the strip is over two million.</p><p>Anera has a list of those vetted to receive aid in the tent camps. Most people come from northern Gaza, they have had their homes destroyed in the war, lost loved ones, and have no money.</p><p>\"We live off the community kitchen, the takia,\" says Aida Salha from Gaza City. \"They bring us food, water and bread. There is bread maybe once a week or once every four days.\"</p><p>The mother-of-six is living with other relatives in a borrowed tent, which she says collapsed on them during the recent heavy rain.</p><p>\"I swear nothing has changed since the ceasefire,\" she continues. \"We were only happy that the constant bloodshed stopped.\"</p><p>Aid agencies are pushing for Israel to open up all five crossing points into Gaza; currently only three are operating.</p><p>They also want restrictions to be eased on the operations of some established humanitarian organisations - caused by Israeli registration issues - so that they can bring in their own supplies.</p><p>For now, the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) reports that a quarter of households in Gaza are eating just one meal daily.</p><p>It says the prices of basics such as vegetables, sunflower oil and flour have dropped on local markets, although they remain far higher than they were two years ago, before the war.</p><p>In surveys, two-thirds of households reported difficulties buying food – in almost all cases because of a lack of cash.</p><p>\"We've entered the third year since the war and I have no money left - no gold, no possessions. I'm totally wiped out,\" says Abdul Karim Abdul Hadi, a father-of-seven from Jabalia in northern Gaza who receives food from Anera.</p><p>\"My son was martyred. All four floors of our house were destroyed. We lost two cars. We are totally destroyed. We live in a catastrophic situation every day.\"</p><p>With the onset of cold, wet weather, life has been getting harder.</p><p>Aid workers like Sami Matar, do their best to help those living in the camps.</p><p>\"The conversations we have with the families in the camps are heartbreaking,\" he says.</p><p>\"The overwhelming feelings are deep uncertainty and exhaustion. They see no clear path to return to their homes. They worry how to keep their children warm and fed.\"</p><p>After the UN Security Council approved the Trump blueprint for Gaza this week, people are waiting to see what happens next.</p><p>They know the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas remains shaky but desperately need it to stick.</p><p>\"The future hope is very simple,\" Mr Matar says. \"People want to live in a safe secure place and be able to cook a hot meal for their children with love and dignity.\"</p><p>Israel has escalated its campaign on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, raising fears of a resumption of hostilities.</p><p>A Human Rights Watch report claims Israel’s forcible displacement of residents from three refugee camps violates international humanitarian law.</p><p>Several groups - some of them backed by Israel - are ranged against Hamas in Gaza, with complex and overlapping ties.</p><p>Soldiers from more than 20 countries, diplomats and aid workers are based at the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC).</p><p>The Israeli military says it struck several Hamas targets after gunmen fired at soldiers in Gaza in violation of the five-week-old ceasefire.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>A 21-year-old Ukrainian sumo wrestler who fled the Russian invasion has won an elite-level sumo competition in Japan, where he’s been lauded for his rapid rise in the hyper-competitive sport.</p><p>Yavhusishyn Danylo, known by his ring name Aonishiki, emerged victorious from the November Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday, according to national broadcaster NHK. In the deciding match, he defeated Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, a top-ranked wrestler.</p><p>“It’s a feeling that words can’t express,” Aonishiki said after his win, according to NHK. “It felt like I was just letting my body do its thing, using my own strength. I’ve been diligently doing what my master told me, and it led to this result.”</p><p>His win caps a meteoric rise within the sport, dictated by ritual and tradition, in the three years since the 21-year-old arrived in Japan as war ravaged his home country.</p><p>He had started with wrestling and judo as a child in Ukraine, where martial arts have long been popular; the country boasts a long list of Olympic medal-winning wrestlers. At seven years old, he switched to sumo after seeing sumo athletes training at his judo facility, according to CNN affiliate Asahi Shimbun.</p><p>He quickly demonstrated a talent for the sport, placing third at the junior world sumo championships in Japan at just 15 years old – which is where he befriended Japanese sumo wrestler Arata Yamanaka.</p><p>Then, that all shuddered to a halt in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Wrestling facilities were destroyed, and athletes and their families fled abroad – including Aonishiki, whose family moved to Germany.</p><p>“I thought it would be a shame to end my sports career there,” Aonishiki told NHK in a documentary about his journey that aired in July. “I liked sumo, I felt I should try to compete in sumo somehow on the path I’d chosen.”</p><p>So, at 18 years old, he came alone to Japan – where his friend Yamanaka, at the time captain of the sumo club at Kansai University, offered to house Aonishiki at his family home and arranged for the Ukrainian to train at the university club.</p><p>His ring name translates to “blue” – one of the colors of the Ukrainian flag.</p><p>Aonishiki began rebuilding his career in a new country and a new language. Soon, he became fluent in Japanese and climbed the ranks at record speed – defeating his fellow university wrestlers despite not being the largest or heaviest (at only 140 kilograms, or 308 pounds – lower than average for top-division sumo wrestlers).</p><p>He eventually joined the Tokyo-based Ajigawa stable to live, train and compete professionally. By Sunday’s tournament, he had reached the third-highest rank of Sekiwake after competing in just 13 tournaments, a record pace in a sport where rankings often fluctuate, and wrestlers can be promoted or demoted depending on their competition performance.</p><p>After Aonishiki’s win on Sunday, the national sumo governing body held an extraordinary meeting to discuss his potential promotion to the second-highest title of Ozeki, according to NHK.</p><p>But the Ukrainian wrestler wants to go one better. “There’s one more rank above this, so I want to aim for that,” he said, with his eyes firmly on the top title of Yokozuna.</p><p>CNN’s Junko Ogura contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president convicted of plotting a coup, has blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to his ankle monitor - a day after he was removed from house arrest into detention.</p><p>At a hearing in Brasília, he admitted trying to open the monitor with a soldering iron on Friday until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing.</p><p>Officials say the right-wing politician, 70, was taken into custody because he was a flight risk ahead of a supporters' vigil outside his home. He will remain in detention.</p><p>In September, Bolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for the coup plot.</p><p>Bolsonaro is being held in a police station in the capital.</p><p>His legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.</p><p>Bolsonaro was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p><p>Supreme Court justices said that he had known of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.</p><p>The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.</p><p>But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.</p><p>The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.</p><p>Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.</p><p>The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.</p><p>What did we learn from a climate summit that ended in a deal with no new mention of fossil fuels?</p><p>Countries have reached a new deal to tackle climate change - but not everyone is happy.</p><p>A row over fossil fuels has broken out at COP30 but this is also likely to be a negotiating tactic.</p><p>President Lula's government recognises 10 new Indigenous lands in an effort to protect their culture and environment.</p><p>Arsenal are set to discover the full extent of the thigh injury suffered by centre-back Gabriel while on international duty with Brazil.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Business leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year.</p><p>Firms are still reeling from those: the £25bn National Insurance increase and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage.</p><p>Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.</p><p>So what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves?</p><p>We are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.</p><p>And, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the \"big things\" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.</p><p>When it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.</p><p>The head of the CBI business group, Rain Newton-Smith, has said \"stability is the only road to growth\" and urged the government not to hit businesses with more taxes.</p><p>Speaking to the CBI's annual conference, she said the government needed to make \"hard choices for growth now before they get harder, having the courage to take two tough decisions rather than 20 easier ones\".</p><p>\"It means one or two broad tax rises, rather than death by a thousand taxes.\"</p><p></p><p>So what might be in the mix?</p><p>Business rates are a bug-bear. Many firms have seen their bills almost double, after a pandemic-era discount of 75% for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses was cut to 40% last year.</p><p>The chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.</p><p>Business Secretary Peter Kyle addressed the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference on Monday, and had a couple of business-friendly policies to announce.</p><p>He pledged to lower electricity bills for 7,000 British businesses, and said the British Business Bank would focus its lending on the eight \"high potential\" sectors identified in the industrial strategy.</p><p>He told the conference: \"Let's not kid ourselves — actual growth, real growth, comes from enterprise and wealth creation.</p><p>\"We will build a pro-business, pro-wealth creation, pro-growth Britain. This week's budget will take the fair and necessary choices to embed that further.\"</p><p>The chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as \"probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament\", as a way of removing barriers to growth.</p><p>Bank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative.</p><p>It is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis.</p><p>That in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.</p><p>The oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the \"windfall\" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.</p><p>The additional 38% tax, which is on top of a 40% tax rate specific to the industry, is due to expire in 2030. There is a chance it could be phased out earlier.</p><p>Among bosses there is still concern over the government's flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one.</p><p>Rain Newton-Smith told the CBI conference that the government should \"change course\" on the bill and that businesses were not being listened to.</p><p>There is no sign the government is backing off, but Kyle recently told a committee of MPs that there were 26 consultations to come on exactly how these measures will be implemented.</p><p>The business secretary told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that any changes to the law would \"be implemented in a way that is benefiting business and benefiting the people who work in business\".</p><p>\"We do not see this as zero-sum,\" he said.</p><p>The chancellor is also expected to speak in the Budget about consumers having the \"confidence to spend\".</p><p>Some in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm's wage structure.</p><p>One other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.</p><p>Such schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come.</p><p>What the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.</p><p>After months of anxious waiting business may then breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>According to a recent survey by Barclays, 55% of business leaders say they are delaying investment decisions until they have seen the Budget. But 43% say they expect to increase investment after it, a sign of possible pent-up optimism.</p><p>But confidence is still very fragile. The chancellor will need to handle with care.</p><p>Imtyaz Begum, from Bradford, joins calls, including from Yorkshire's mayors, for an end to the cap.</p><p>Business owners suggest measures like a cut in the rate of VAT to help the struggling sector.</p><p>Businesses in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire are calling for help in this year's Budget.</p><p>The chancellor will announce the package when she reveals the details of the Budget on Wednesday.</p><p>A former Bank of England chief economist says Budget speculation has \"caused paralysis for businesses and consumers\".</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.</p><p>More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.</p><p>These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.</p><p>Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.</p><p>But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or \"Hokkaido Valley\", as some have begun to call it - the country could become a new contender in the $600bn (£458bn) race to supply the world's computer chips.</p><p>At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.</p><p>Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.</p><p>The government has invested $12bn in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or \"fab\" in the small city of Chitose.</p><p>In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty.</p><p>Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.</p><p>Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.</p><p>A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.</p><p>The high-tech machinery helped bring about Rapidus' biggest accomplishment yet earlier this year – the successful production of prototype two nanometre (2nm) transistors.</p><p>These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.</p><p>It's a feat only rival chip makers TSMC and Samsung have accomplished. Intel is not pursuing 2nm, it is leapfrogging from 7nm straight to 1.8nm.</p><p>\"We succeeded in manufacturing the 2nm prototype for the first time in Japan, and at an unprecedented speed in Japan and globally,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>He credits the IBM partnership for helping achieve the breakthrough.</p><p>Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.</p><p>Rapidus is confident that it is on track to mass produce 2nm chips by 2027. The challenge will be achieving the yield and quality that is needed to survive in an incredibly competitive market – the very areas where Taiwan and South Korea have pulled ahead.</p><p>TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.</p><p>In a 2024 report, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office highlighted that although Rapidus is receiving government subsidies and consortium members are contributing funds: \"The financing falls short of the expected 5 trillion yen ($31.8bn; £24.4bn) needed to start mass production.\"</p><p>The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: \"Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung).\"</p><p>Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.</p><p>Nevertheless, Japan's government is pouring money into the chip industry - $27bn between 2020 and early 2024 - a larger commitment relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) than the US made through the Biden-era CHIPS Act.</p><p>In late 2024, Tokyo unveiled a $65bn package for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors that could further support Rapidus's expansion plans.</p><p>This comes after decades of decline. Forty years ago Japan made more than half of the world's semiconductors. Today, it produces just over 10%.</p><p>Many point to US-Japan trade tensions in the 1980s as a turning point.</p><p>Naoyuki Yoshino, professor emeritus at Keio University, said Japan lost out in the technology stakes to Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s, leaving domestic companies weaker.</p><p>Unlike its rivals, Japan failed to sustain subsidies to keep its chipmakers competitive.</p><p>But Mr Koike says that mentality has changed.</p><p>\"The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again.\"</p><p>Japan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.</p><p>More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.</p><p>Japan also faces a severe shortage of semiconductor engineers – an estimated 40,000 people in the coming years.</p><p>Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.</p><p>The government's push is already attracting major global players.</p><p>TSMC is producing 12–28nm chips in Kumamoto, on the south-western island of Kyushu - a significant step for Japan, even if it lags behind the company's cutting-edge production in Taiwan.</p><p>The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments.</p><p>Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a \"fab\", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow.</p><p>TSMC started building a second plant on Kyushu in October this year, which is due to begin production by the end of 2027.</p><p>Beyond Rapidus and TSMC, local players like Kioxia and Toshiba are also getting government backing.</p><p>Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.</p><p>American memory chipmaker Micron will also receive $3.63bn in subsidies from the Japanese government to grow facilities in Hiroshima, while Samsung is building a research and development facility in Yokohama.</p><p>Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there.</p><p>\"This will make a form of 'global ecosystem',\" Mr Koike says, \"where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world.\"</p><p>Mr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players.</p><p>\"TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>Global demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers -  still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.</p><p>Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers.</p><p>\"We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.</p><p>And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.</p><p>Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</p><p>Authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate.</p><p>\"Pastor\" Kim Nok-wan, 33, ran a cybersex ring that exploited hundreds of victims including minors.</p><p>India defeated Nepal by seven wickets in the final played in Sri Lankan capital Colombo on Sunday.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>Days of torrential rain leaves vast swathes of the country inundated and facing landslides.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

And they will govern how long you must be separated before finalizing a divorce, as well as how assets and debts may be split.</p><p>NOLO has a state-by-state breakdown here. But you also might consider paying for an hour of time with a well-regarded local family law attorney or experienced divorce mediator to learn more, Guillen said.</p><p>Shearin suggested the same, noting that “there may be nuances that could make your situation very different from what you’re reading online. And you may not be objective about what you’re reading.”</p><p>If you already have a prenuptial agreement, it can inform a lot about how assets, debts, alimony and child support may be handled in a divorce. But it won’t necessarily override all state marital laws – for instance, if the pre-nup terms were not mutually negotiated and are considered to be highly unfair to one spouse.</p><p>Typically, all assets acquired during a marriage are jointly owned by both spouses (eg, income, investments, stock options, homes, etc.). Each person’s property acquisition rights, however, end on the date a couple legally separates, Guillen said.</p><p>So if you’re both still deciding whether you can make the marriage work but want time apart, you might instead do a trial separation because it won’t stop the clock on the marriage. “None of your financial rights will be impacted,” she said.</p><p>Even though it’s not a formal, legal separation, she nevertheless recommends a couple draft and sign an agreement that clearly indicates it’s just a “trial” separation, includes the term of when it will begin and end as well as what goals you have for that period (eg, evaluate our marriage, go to therapy, etc.). Also include a statement about how money will be handled during the trial period – such as how joint bills will be paid.</p><p>Even for couples who stay married, both spouses should be aware of their assets and liabilities on a regular basis. But it will be essential to have a full view of the marital estate if you do decide to divorce, because each spouse will need to financially disclose all assets, income and debts to their respective divorce attorney, or other divorce professional they hire.</p><p>Shearin, who serves as the director of education for the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts, recommends compiling for yourself in one place – preferably in a digital cloud file – bank, retirement and brokerage account statements; mortgage documents; home appraisals; credit card statements; at least three years of tax returns; loan documents (eg, car and student loans); pay stubs; employment contracts; and insurance policies (eg, life, home, auto and health).</p><p>Doing this before the divorce process starts “prevents surprises and makes you better prepared,” she said.</p><p>And it can save money, she added, because if you email documents separately or incompletely or fail to send some, “the divorce professional who charges by the hour will charge you to follow up and download each one. If you have everything ready to go, it’s more efficient and less expensive.”</p><p>Divorcing can be expensive for both parties – and not just because of legal bills.</p><p>Before you move ahead, consider realistically what it will cost you and your spouse to live apart. “Most families spend what they make. And now they have to support two households,” Shearin said.</p><p>If you need help, a financial adviser can help you estimate income, housing costs, insurance changes, child-related expenses and the lifestyle adjustments that may be needed.</p><p>“It helps you understand your financial needs before negotiations begin,” she said. “Until you understand all the pieces, you won’t be able to move forward in a way that’s proactive.”</p><p>You typically will be advised not to move large amounts of money out of joint accounts, take on new debts or buy or sell property.</p><p>Legally and financially, “changes to finances before filing can backfire,” Shearin said.</p><p>For instance, in California, Guillen said, if you make changes, especially without informing your spouse, you could be found to have breached your fiduciary duty. That duty requires you, among other things, to be transparent about finances, make financial decisions with your spouse’s best interest in mind and not to misappropriate assets.</p><p>And don’t sign anything pertaining to your joint assets and debts without getting legal advice, Shearin added.</p><p>If you think you will get divorced, create a new email account for yourself and don’t share your password. This is where you will keep privileged attorney communications, divorce-related document storage and scheduling throughout the process, Shearin said. “It keeps all divorce-related communication separate, organized, and searchable — and reduces emotional triggers from seeing divorce emails in your everyday inbox.”</p><p>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

{"details":"<p>England's two innings in the first Test lasted fewer than 70 overs combined</p><p>When we heard England were considering sending some players to Canberra for the Lions game, we assumed it would be those in need of practice.</p><p>The three they are sending - Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts - did not feature in the first Test in Perth and seem highly unlikely to play in the second in Brisbane. It is a bizarre situation.</p><p>England's original plan was not to send anyone for the game against the Prime Minister's XI, so little has changed. The likes of Zak Crawley, Joe Root and Harry Brook, who appear to need some time at the crease, will be off to Brisbane to bat in the nets.</p><p>England are responsible for their preparation and their performances on the field. They are responsible for giving it their best shot of winning the Ashes. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</p><p>Australia are a superb team in day-night Tests - they have won 13 of their 14 pink-ball matches. Mitchell Starc is outstanding in those conditions.</p><p>Just because Australia are accustomed to these matches and England are not, it does not mean England cannot win.</p><p>But there is a huge question about whether England would be better prepared playing a game under lights than spending time in the nets in Brisbane.</p><p>England - the management, players and administrators - will be held to account at the end of the Ashes if their plans do not work.</p><p>In the aftermath of the heavy defeat in the first Test I have been struck by the genuine anger among supporters.</p><p>People have spent a lot of money and there is real frustration, a depth of feeling I don't think I have seen before. The England team ignore that at their peril.</p><p>It was the worst defeat of an England team I have seen in a Test in this country. They should have won. Instead, the game was tossed away calamitously and feebly.</p><p>No first-choice England batters in tour match</p><p>I'd be licking my lips bowling to England - McGrath</p><p>For The Love Of Cricket podcast: Mark Wood joins Stuart Broad & Jos Buttler to reflect on first Test</p><p>I know there has been quite a lot of reaction to the interview Ben Stokes gave to me straight after the match ended. I am not upset if he was a little tetchy. His team had just been humiliated in front of 50,000 people, so to then have to speak to TV and radio is incredibly difficult.</p><p>Stokes told me his team works hard. I cannot disagree with him. We see them train and know they give it absolutely everything. They are supremely fit. Potts looks like he should be in the SAS.</p><p>Does that mean they can go out and play cricket well? Are England working hard on the right things?</p><p>Under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, England have decided they are going to play in a certain way. They say it is a method that gives them the best chance of winning.</p><p>Is that correct? It did not work in the fifth Test against India at The Oval, a game they should have won. It has not worked here.</p><p>When Stokes and McCullum took over, their attitude was a breath of fresh air. It was what England needed after a depressing run of one win in 17 Tests. Across 18 months they played some exhilarating cricket, shredding bowling attacks.</p><p>Supporters fell back in love with the England team, which was vital for the health of the game in our country.</p><p>However, there were some of us who knew the method was unsustainable. The mood around England was positive, so the dissenters stayed quiet.</p><p>But the teams England beat in those early months of the Stokes-McCullum regime were not of the highest quality. They have played three five-Test series and not won any of them. In their past 14 Tests, England have more defeats than wins - seven to six.</p><p>Mitchell Starc has taken more Test wickets with the pink ball than anyone else - 81 at an average of 17.08</p><p>Over the course of 150 years of Test cricket history there is a reason why successful batting has been built of solid defence, not sailing down the pitch and taking a swipe at the bowling.</p><p>I have spoken to a number of former Australia players since the first Test ended. One problem they identified is a lack of accountability in the England set-up.</p><p>\"That's the way we play,\" is a mantra of this England team and it is one of their failings.</p><p>There should be some reflection on what happened in Perth, looking at what happened in a mature fashion.</p><p>The shots Brook was playing were from the third XI of a village team. He needs to grow up. Compare Brook with the wonderful innings of Travis Head. There is a huge difference between recklessness and controlled aggression.</p><p>We have laboured the point about England's limited preparation, but a lot of what we feared came true in the first Test.</p><p>When it was announced that England had only one warm-up game against the Lions, we could have predicted how wickets would fall in the first Test: edging rising deliveries outside off stump by attempting to play booming drives. Look what happened.</p><p>A lot of the anger aimed at England comes from a feeling they do not care. Supporters see the way these England players get out and think it does not matter to them.</p><p>I can categorically say it is not true. The players care deeply. In the aftermath of the Test I saw Crawley in a cafe. He had just bagged a pair, facing only 11 balls in the match.</p><p>He looked utterly miserable, sitting there like a man with a contagious disease. He was certainly not out having a good time, or playing 18 holes on the golf course.</p><p>The golf narrative is another I can defend England from. When they train, they train hard. What are they supposed to do for the rest of the day? Sit in their hotel rooms watching Netflix? There is nothing wrong with being in the fresh air, doing something to take the mind away from cricket.</p><p>England are only 1-0 down. It would be madness to write them off in this series. One thing they can take from Perth is they exposed some vulnerabilities in the Australia team.</p><p>But Stokes, McCullum and the rest must pick themselves up and understand the right way to go about things in Brisbane.</p><p>I once played in a one-day international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where we got trounced by seven wickets. We walked off in front of 85,000 people knowing we had been thoroughly outplayed. I never wanted to experience that feeling again.</p><p>This England team will have gone through the same in Perth and should now be determined not to have a repeat in Brisbane.</p><p>A result at the Gabba is vital. If England go 2-0 down, jobs and careers will be on the line.</p><p>Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt</p><p>Get cricket news sent straight to your phone</p><p>Champions League news conferences and build-up: Maresca and Guardiola speaking</p><p>England will be held to account if preparation backfires - Agnew</p><p>'Salah not helping' - Rooney calls for 'big' decision</p><p>Preview the return of The Night Manager</p><p>Is cricket financially healthy?</p><p>Daddy Issues is back for a new series</p><p>Sir Stephen Fry has remained 'faithful' to BlackBerry</p><p>England will be held to account if preparation backfires - Agnew</p><p>'Why things will never be same again for super-talented Eze'</p><p>Sports Personality of the Year set for 18 December</p><p>'Salah not helping' - Rooney calls for 'big' decision</p><p>Newcastle, PSG, Real Madrid... full kits and a London park</p><p>Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham  VideoEze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham</p><p>Vaughan confused by 'amateurish' England plans before second Test.

{"details":"<p>Talk about arriving on the scene as an Arsenal player.</p><p>Eberechi Eze did that in style with his hat-trick against Tottenham - and things will never be the same for him again.</p><p>We already knew Eze was super-talented from his time at Crystal Palace, and he had made a good start to his Arsenal career, showing glimpses of brilliance.</p><p>But the ultimate test when you are at a huge club like Arsenal is what you do in the big games, so Sunday's 4-1 north London derby victory was the perfect occasion for him to produce his best performance in a Gunners shirt.</p><p>Eze is an Arsenal fan too of course, which made his day even more special. He became the first player to score a hat-trick in this game since 1978, and it actually looked effortless for him.</p><p>As I said on Match of the Day, he  was a joy to watch and he has a wonderful knack of making the game look wonderfully easy.</p><p>His finishing for all three of his goals was superb, but so was his skill, his movement and his ability to find space. He is two footed and being comfortable on both sides means he is elegant and moves the ball beautifully.</p><p>Eze was brought in to unlock defences that sit deep like Spurs did, and he showed off every aspect of his game.</p><p>After a performance like that, he will feel like he is walking on air for the next few days, but the fact he did it in this fixture will mean things are different for him going further forward too.</p><p>Eze fires hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham</p><p>I know from experience there are certain games where, if you are the player who makes the difference, the fans never forget it.</p><p>I had been a Liverpool player for more than three years when I scored my first winner for them against Manchester United in 2000. I was used to being asked for autographs and people talking to me, but that goal against our biggest rivals suddenly elevated everything to a different level.</p><p>I was now the player who had scored that goal for us, and against them. It was like people saw me in a different way, and certainly thought more highly of me, because I had given them this joy in a fixture that meant so much to them.</p><p>It will be the same for Eze now and the immediate effect of his hat-trick is that, in the next few games, he will be so full of confidence he will feel like he can try anything because he cannot do anything wrong.</p><p>Whenever he next walks out on the pitch, whether it's against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday or Chelsea in the Premier League next weekend, he will feel he has the fans 100% behind him, because they adore him now more than ever.</p><p>It will be the same whenever he gets on the ball, too. You know the fans love you and that transfers to your game. You are thinking \"give me the ball, what am I going to do next?\" The feeling is amazing, and he will want to express himself and show the world how good he is.</p><p>That's the buzz you get and it applies to any player scoring a hat-trick in a game of this size, but it always means a bit more when you are a fan of the team you do it for - it really does.</p><p>You feel a warmth from the supporters it is very hard to get if you've not grown up knowing it yourself.</p><p>I'd been at Old Trafford as a Liverpool fan watching them play there, so I understood what beating United meant to our supporters, the same as Eze will know what beating Spurs means to Arsenal fans.</p><p>What he did on Sunday will live with him forever, and the supporters will know he gets it too.</p><p>How Eze shone for Arsenal in derby debut</p><p>So he is going to have an incredible few weeks. The only slight danger when something like this happens is you get carried away and start to think you really are amazing and things will just happen for you in games - it doesn't work like that!</p><p>But Eze is such a humble guy he would never think like that anyway. His work ethic shows you what his attitude is like and, against Spurs, he was still chasing players back into his own half from a corner even after he had scored his hat-trick.</p><p>There are some players who I watch now and really want to do well, whoever they play for, because they are such likeable characters - and Eze is one of those.</p><p>He has done things the hard way to become an Arsenal and England player at the age of 27 and his story, having been released by Arsenal's academy aged 13, makes it even more incredible.</p><p>Eze is the type of player Arteta can rely on. He's creative, he's confident and he's a game-changer. I called him a \"wow footballer\" on Match of the Day because he excites me so much, and I am looking forward to what comes next for him too.</p><p>The only dilemma for Arsenal is they have got Martin Odegaard and Eze who can both play as wonderful number 10s.</p><p>Who does Arteta pick? It's a great problem to have.</p><p>Only Erling Haaland (25), Mohamed Salah (23) and Bryan  Mbeumo (21) have had more goal involvements in the Premier League in 2025-26 than Eberechi Eze</p><p>If things had gone differently in the summer, Eze could have been lining up against Arsenal on Sunday rather than playing for them.</p><p>It probably makes the defeat even more painful for Spurs that a player they tried to sign ended up scoring a hat-trick against them.</p><p>But Eze's achievement was just the icing on the cake for Arteta's side, because there were outstanding performances right through their team.</p><p>Mikel Merino was playing out of position again at centre-forward but caused Spurs so many problems. Jurrien Timber's performance at right-back was as good as I've seen from anyone in that position for a long time - he is in the conversation with the likes of Achraf Hakimi now as being among the best in the world.</p><p>We've already seen Cristhian Mosquera come in for William Saliba and fill in without any problems and now we've seen Piero Hincapie come in for Gabriel and look dominant too.</p><p>When Arsenal signed Mosquera and Hincapie in the summer, we talked about how they had added to their depth on paper, but we are seeing the strength of their squad on the pitch now too. It has created a competition for places that has enhanced everyone's performances.</p><p>Arsenal 'dominated in every part of the game' in 'beautiful' derby - Arteta</p><p>Arteta must be delighted to see the levels his players are at, not just in terms of their technical ability but also with their physicality and work-rate.</p><p>All of them are willing to give everything because they know if they don't, they won't play - and Arteta deserves great credit for that. He has created a mindset where the hard work is as important as their attacking play, if not more so.</p><p>They don't carry anyone and even up front, Viktor Gyokeres, who was missing against Spurs because of injury, has epitomised their attitude to pressing.</p><p>You know it doesn't matter who plays, they will all be at it defensively. That obviously takes discipline mentally, but physically they all look ready too.</p><p>Every aspect of their game is exactly where it should be and they look so full of belief in what they are doing.</p><p>One of the thing that impresses me the most is you can see that, even if they have an off day with the ball, it doesn't look like they are going to ever have an off day without it.</p><p>They look like a powerhouse, a unit that is focused on winning games and is desperate to put the last few years of finishing second in the Premier League to bed.</p><p>The way they are playing at the moment is ominous for everyone else, because it is hard to see how anyone is going to challenge them.</p><p>Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.</p><p>Champions League news conferences and build-up: Maresca and Guardiola speaking</p><p>England will be held to account if preparation backfires - Agnew</p><p>'Salah not helping' - Rooney calls for 'big' decision</p><p>Preview the return of The Night Manager</p><p>Is cricket financially healthy?</p><p>Daddy Issues is back for a new series</p><p>Sir Stephen Fry has remained 'faithful' to BlackBerry</p><p>England will be held to account if preparation backfires - Agnew</p><p>'Why things will never be same again for super-talented Eze'</p><p>Sports Personality of the Year set for 18 December</p><p>'Salah not helping' - Rooney calls for 'big' decision</p><p>Newcastle, PSG, Real Madrid... full kits and a London park</p><p>Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham  VideoEze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham</p><p>Vaughan confused by 'amateurish' England plans before second Test.

They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs.</p><p>\"It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win.</p><p>\"So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave.\"</p><p>He argued that \"something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research\".</p><p>\"It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?\"</p><p>While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations.</p><p>Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology.</p><p>\"AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,\" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle.</p><p>Some of the businesses at the event \"are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,\" he added.</p><p>\"If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,\" Kyle said.</p><p>He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity.</p><p>AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's AI Plan for Wales promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to \"drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive\".</p><p>It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology.</p><p>Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government.</p><p>But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales.</p><p>There have been considerable protests against plans to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas.</p><p>\"Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,\" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons.</p><p>Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands.</p><p>\"What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,\" he said.</p><p>\"There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure.</p><p>\"When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible.\"</p><p>Mr George warned Wales could \"lose out\" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions.</p><p>Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant \"the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly\".</p><p>While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots.</p><p>\"They've become very sycophantic,\" he said.</p><p>The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right.</p><p>\"This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.'</p><p>\"So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you.\"</p><p>As AI-generated music floods streaming platforms, questions bubble over whether listeners are owed more transparency.</p><p>Appearing from the Vatican via video, the pontiff spoke to youth attending a Catholic conference in the US state of Indiana.</p><p>Strong sales at artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia did little to quell investor worries.</p><p>The accountancy giant says artificial intelligence will eventually lead to fewer entry-level positions at the firm.</p><p>Thousands of earthquakes were caused by magma \"pumping through\" Earth's crust for three months, they say.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.</p><p>The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.</p><p>Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.</p><p>Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.</p><p>Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.</p><p>This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.</p><p>The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.</p><p>The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.</p><p>UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.</p><p>They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.</p><p>About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".</p><p>This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.</p><p>Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.</p><p>It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.</p><p>When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.</p><p>\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"</p><p>The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.</p><p>Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.</p><p>\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.</p><p>Thanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.</p><p>They claim to have surrounded the entire area, but Kyiv has repeatedly denied that.</p><p>The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".</p><p>And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.</p><p>As a result, soldiers remain in frontline positions for weeks, sometimes even months.</p><p>It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.</p><p>A single unit of the 5th brigade can carry out several logistical missions with UGVs in one day.</p><p>Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.</p><p>Supplies are loaded on a land drone called Termit, capable of carrying about 200kg. The operator drives it by remote control into the back of a van which takes it closer to the frontline to preserve its battery.</p><p>When it is dark, two soldiers jump out of the van and roll out the UGV.</p><p>One of them informs the control room via radio that the land drone has been offloaded.</p><p>Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.</p><p>Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.</p><p>At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.</p><p>They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.</p><p>\"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".</p><p>During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.</p><p>Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.</p><p>On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps.</p><p>While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers at the front are angry, defiant and resigned after US plan became public.</p><p>Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>The use of drones is non-intrusive and helps to minimise disruption, National Grid says.</p><p>There are 28 key points and while several on the face of it could be acceptable to Ukraine, others cross Kyiv's red lines.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>There's a new song doing the rounds, and in the immortal words of Kylie Minogue, you just can't get it out of your head.</p><p>But what if it was created by a robot, or the artist themself is a product of artificial intelligence (AI)? Do streaming sites have an obligation to label music as AI-generated? And does it even matter, if you like what you hear?</p><p>A survey published last week suggested 97% of respondents could not spot an AI-generated song. But there are some telltale signs - if you know where to look.</p><p>Here's a quick guide.</p><p>AI music became one of last summer's hottest topics after accusations the band The Velvet Sundown were AI-generated sent them viral.</p><p>The band, who had no record label and a minimal social media footprint, quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of monthly listeners on Spotify after releasing two albums just weeks apart - and the music world grew suspicious.</p><p>The band initially denied the claims, later describing themselves as a synthetic project \"guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced and visualised with the support of artificial intelligence\".</p><p>They claimed the project was an \"artistic provocation\", not a trick, but many fans felt betrayed.</p><p>Internet sleuths were suspicious of the band's airbrushed photos, which featured non-descript backgrounds and a warm orange filter.</p><p>There was also no record of them having performed live – no glowing reviews from fans posted online, nor any concert photos or videos. The band members had not given interviews and did not appear to have individual social media accounts.</p><p>Looking into the real-life and social media presence of an artist can be one helpful indicator of whether or not they are real. But experts tell the BBC that fast-developing, sophisticated technology means it is increasingly hard to know when a song has been made using AI.</p><p>Still, while it may be tricky, they say there are signs listeners can be alert to.</p><p>When LJ Rich started creating AI music around five years ago, she recalls how it could only generate three seconds at a time, taking about 10 hours to create a minute of audio.</p><p>Now, an entire song can be summoned rapidly with a single prompt, sparking what industry experts have described as an \"explosion\" of AI music, sometimes referred to as \"slop\" - on streaming platforms.</p><p>A song with a formulaic feel - sweet but without much substance or emotional weight - can be a sign of AI, says the musician and technology speaker, as well as vocals that feel breathless.</p><p>AI songs tend to stick to generic verse-chorus structures, and usually don't have a satisfying ending. AI is also more likely to create lyrics that follow a correct grammatical structure, says Rich, whereas some of the most beautiful or memorable words penned by humans don't always make sense.</p><p>Just ask Alicia Keys and her \"concrete jungle where dreams are made of\", or The Rolling Stones and their flirtation with double negatives in (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.</p><p>\"If it doesn't feel emotional, it's a really big part,\" the former BBC Click presenter continues. \"Does it create that tension and resolution that is a fundamental part of the music that we love? Does it have a story inside it?\"</p><p>Another tell-tale sign is unrealistic levels of productivity. Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, describes how one artist was recently believed to be AI after dropping multiple soundalike albums simultaneously.</p><p>Their songs resembled a mashup of 80s rock bands – like \"really classic rock hits that had been put in a blender\".</p><p>\"This will be fine for background music for most people,\" she continues, \"but it won't work for creating the superstars of the future who, of course, draw on the past but then make something completely new out of it.\"</p><p>Sometimes, what might stand out is a song that sounds almost too perfect, lacking minor flaws and variances.</p><p>This could mean no strain in the vocals, and overly polished production, according to Tony Rigg, music industry adviser and lecturer in music industry management at the University of Lancashire.</p><p>He adds that odd phrasing, unnatural emotional delivery, and lyrics that feel generic or repetitive can also be clues.</p><p>\"AI hasn't felt heartbreak yet... It knows patterns,\" he explains. \"What makes music human is not just sound but the stories behind it.\"</p><p>It's also worth paying close attention to the vocals. AI \"singers\" often sound a little slurred. Consonants and plosives (hard sounds like \"p\" and \"t\") aren't quite right. You might hear \"ghost\" harmonies, where backing vocals appear and disappear at random.</p><p>However, Rigg calls these signs \"hints not proof\", acknowledging it is not very easy for the casual listener to detect AI-generated songs.</p><p>As well as being used to generate full songs, AI is also becoming a tool some established artists are using to support their creativity.</p><p>There currently isn't any obligation – or consistent way – for artists to let fans know if and how they are using AI.</p><p>Some are very open: the Beatles, for example, used machine learning to extract the voice of John Lennon from a 1970s cassette recording to release what they called their \"last song\", Now and Then, in 2023.</p><p>And artists including Imogen Heap and Timbaland have created AI personas and released singles under their names.</p><p>Last month, Heap released the song Aftercare with her AI model ai.Mogen, trained on her voice.</p><p>She created the voice model as a chatbot - a \"desperate attempt\" to keep up with a deluge of messages and requests including from fans - but more recently, it has featured on several songs and allowed Heap to take part in more collaborations than she otherwise would have due to time constraints.</p><p>While \"it does sound different if you really know my voice\", she says she has put a lot of work into making the AI version of her voice sound human and doesn't think listeners would be able to tell.</p><p>Heap isn't trying to mislead listeners –  ai.Mogen is listed as a co-contributor on the track.</p><p>But she hopes if people feel a human connection to the song, without already knowing part of the vocals are sung by her AI model, they might reconsider any preconceived negative ideas or fears they have about AI.</p><p>\"I hope that people listen, don't realise, find peace in that,\" she tells the BBC.</p><p>She says she isn't against using AI to actually create music, but it's just not something she's got around to doing yet.</p><p>Heap believes there should be more transparency around what goes into a song, and how AI has been used.</p><p>Citing the example of someone reading the label of a microwave ready meal so they know the ingredients, she says: \"We need that for music, and we need that for AI.\"</p><p>There is currently no legal obligation for streaming platforms to label AI-generated songs, despite increasing calls for them to signpost such tracks.</p><p>In January, the streaming platform Deezer launched an AI detection tool, followed this summer by a system which tags AI-generated music.</p><p>Deezer says its detection system can flag tracks made with the most prolific AI music creation tools, and is working on expanding its ability to detect music made by others. It says the risk of false positives - eg incorrectly flagging a track created by a human - is very low.</p><p>This week, the company said a third (34%) of content uploaded to its platform was fully AI-generated – about 50,000 tracks a day.</p><p>Manuel Moussallam, Deezer's director of research, says his team was so surprised by how many tracks were flagged up by the detector when it first launched they were \"pretty convinced we had an issue\".</p><p>The tool quickly flagged up the music by The Velvet Sundown – the band who went viral over the summer – as being \"100% AI-generated\".</p><p>Other platforms have recently announced steps toward more transparency.</p><p>In September, Spotify said it would roll out a new spam filter later this year to identify \"bad actors\", and prevent \"slop\" being recommended to listeners. In the past year, it has removed more than 75 million spam tracks.</p><p>It is also supporting a way to enable artists to say where and how AI was used in a track, through a system by a consortium of industry members called DDEX. This information will be included in the metadata of a track and displayed on its app.</p><p>Spotify says it is about recognising listeners' desire for more information, as well as \"strengthening trust\".</p><p>\"It's not about punishing artists who use AI responsibly or down-ranking tracks for disclosing information about how they were made.\"</p><p>If you've fallen hard for a new artist, does it matter if they or their songs are made by AI?</p><p>Some believe the presence of AI is irrelevant – engagement is driven by enjoyment, and music people love is already serving its primary purpose.</p><p>Others say music fans should be able to make informed choices about what they listen to.</p><p>Artists have shared deep concerns around the impact of AI, and hundreds of musicians including Dua Lipa and Sir Elton John have protested about the use of their songs in the training of AI tools.</p><p>For LJ Rich, the use of AI in music raises many \"weird and beautiful ethical questions\" which remain as yet unanswered.</p><p>\"Like if the music makes the hairs on the back of your neck go up, does it matter if an AI wrote it or not?\"</p><p>The Never Gonna Give You UP singer performs at the Shropshire venue on 24 July.</p><p>You can find many different music playlists for dogs and cats online. Do they actually help animals relax?</p><p>Computer scientist Llion Jones helped discover how to create human-like responses from AI technology.</p><p>The 17-year-old is playing Kim in the production, which began its UK tour this week.</p><p>The world-first law aims to reduce the \"risks\" children face online - but it's received pushback.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Every winter, the search for the secret to staying well seems to intensify.</p><p>Supermarket shelves fill with \"immune-boosting\" shots, cold water swimming groups grow and social media becomes crowded with tips on how to fend off seasonal bugs.</p><p>But with so many remedies promising to keep colds and flu at bay, how much of it actually works and is it even possible to boost your immune system in the first place?</p><p>Cold water swimming has surged in popularity, with some enthusiasts convinced it keeps winter illnesses at bay.</p><p>Immunologist professor Eleanor Riley tells BBC Radio 4's Inside Health podcast that the post-swim \"high\" is real, but it's driven by adrenaline and endorphins.</p><p>\"If you take a blood sample before and after a cold swim, white blood cell levels do rise,\" she explains. \"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream.</p><p>\"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells.\"</p><p>Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection.</p><p>Feeling \"brighter, more alert and more connected\" has real physiological effects.</p><p>Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.</p><p>\"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"</p><p>Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses.</p><p>GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming.</p><p>Many people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.</p><p>But Dr McCartney remains cautious.</p><p>\"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"</p><p>Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.</p><p>Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system.</p><p>Vitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds.</p><p>She says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you \"expensive urine\".</p><p>However, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\".</p><p>But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit.</p><p>Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help.</p><p>The likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.</p><p>Professor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water.</p><p>\"The solution can dilute the blocked nose, stimulate turnover of mucus and relieve inflammation.\"</p><p>All three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.</p><p>Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.</p><p>While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress.</p><p>Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

the highest on record.</p><p>Ketamine was upgraded from a Class C substance in 2014 due to mounting evidence over its physical and psychological dangers.</p><p>Currently, the maximum penalty for producing and supplying ketamine is up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>Possession can carry up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both.</p><p>The steep rise shown in the Betsi Cadwaladr area is because the drug is  becoming \"commonplace\", according to Dr James Sutherland, the clinical lead for urology, at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.</p><p>\"One patient told me he can go to the end of his road and score a high,\" he added.</p><p>\"It's cheap as well, so people are spending maybe only £5 on what is a high for an evening or a party, and I think it has become more socially acceptable to use ketamine.\"</p><p>Dr Sutherland said the main issues he sees in patients is bladder pain caused by blockages, with some needing stents inserted to drain the kidneys.</p><p>Many users manage that pain by using even more ketamine, said Dr Sutherland, and some patients end up having their bladders removed entirely, living with a stoma for the rest of their lives.</p><p>\"The symptoms tend to start as kind of urinary urgency and frequency so people become unable to hold on to their urine,\" he said.</p><p>\"From there people then develop blood in their urine, and [they] may become incontinent, and end up becoming dependent on adult nappies, which for young adults is really challenging.\"</p><p>Cheryl Williams is strategic lead for recovery charity Adferiad, and says up to a quarter of their admissions to rehab have been for ketamine use.</p><p>She has been raising awareness of ketamine issues alongside the sister of Colwyn Bay-born drag artist James Lee Williams, better known as The Vivienne, who died in January following a cardiac arrest brought on by the drug.</p><p>They run a ketamine support group in the town, with newcomers turning up every week.</p><p>She says the drug has a particular appeal for young people because it is \"readily available and cheap\", adding: \"Let's say you have a friendship group of three to four.</p><p>\"A couple of pound each and you can be disassociated for 35 to 40 minutes and then you can go back home and your parents might not suspect you've been doing anything.\"</p><p>Wesley still has a long way to go in his rehabilitation - and is facing the prospect of bladder surgery as a result of using ketamine.</p><p>But some of his symptoms have reversed, and he feels fitter and is even back playing football, something he had given up during his addiction.</p><p>\"I thought it was better on drugs doing things than it was sober, but now I'm like this is so much better, like everything is just so new I guess,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>The \"inquisitive\" creature fell 4ft (1.2m) down a shaft while foraging for food before the winter.</p><p>Gloucester House in Highworth provides a faith-based approach to lasting sobriety.</p><p>The designs for the statue of the Python star are revealed for the first time.</p><p>Chanyta Buckley asked to be taken into care as a teenager and has turned her life around as a result.</p><p>Danny Woodburn stole from the age of 11, but now helps tackle the causes of shoplifting.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>In my many years as a journalist, I never thought I would be asking someone how it feels to have trout sperm injected into their face.</p><p>And yet, here I am.</p><p>Abby is lying on a large, black padded chair at a small aesthetics clinic in south Manchester.</p><p>She winces as a small cannula is delicately inserted into her cheek.</p><p>\"Ouch. Ouch,\" she exclaims.</p><p>I should make it clear that 29-year-old Abby is not actually receiving a pure dose of trout sperm.</p><p>The lower part of her face is being injected with tiny fragments of DNA, known as polynucleotides, which have been extracted from either trout or salmon sperm.</p><p>Why? Well, interestingly, our DNA is pretty similar to that of a fish.</p><p>So the hope is Abby's body will not only welcome these tiny strands of fish DNA, her skin cells will be spurred into action, producing more collagen and elastin, two proteins which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of our skin.</p><p>For Abby, the aim is to freshen her skin, keep it healthy, and hopefully, treat the acne she's lived with for many years by reducing scarring and redness.</p><p>\"I just want to target those problem areas,\" she explains.</p><p>Polynucleotides are being touted as the next big skincare \"miracle\" and are rapidly gaining popularity after a number of celebrities have spoken candidly about their \"salmon sperm facials\".</p><p>Earlier this year, Charli XCX told her nine million Instagram followers that she felt \"fillers are kind of over now\", and explained she had moved onto polynucleotides, which are \"kinda like deep vitamins\".</p><p>Kim and Khloe Kardashian are also reportedly avid fans. And when asked about her skincare routine on a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jennifer Aniston responded: \"Don't I have beautiful salmon skin?\"</p><p>So, despite their fishy beginnings, are polynucleotides transforming skincare?</p><p>\"We are having a Benjamin Button moment,\" Suzanne Mansfield, who works for aesthetics company Dermafocus, tells me.</p><p>That's a reference to the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, where Brad Pitt plays a man who ages backwards. By the time he's in his later years, he has the skin of a baby's bottom.</p><p>While such an effect is highly unlikely and would probably be a tad disconcerting, Ms Mansfield says polynucleotides are forging the way when it comes to regenerative skincare.</p><p>A small but growing body of research and clinical trials suggest that injecting polynucleotides can rejuvenate skin, not only making it healthier but potentially reducing fine lines, wrinkles and scars.</p><p>\"All we are doing, by using it in the aesthetics industry,\" she says, \"is enhancing something the body already does. That's why these are so special.\"</p><p>But they also come with a pretty hefty price tag.</p><p>A single session of polynucleotide injections can cost anywhere from £200 to £500 - and it's recommended you have three of these over several weeks.</p><p>After that clinics tend to advise you need to top up every six to nine months to maintain the look.</p><p>Back at the clinic, Abby's treatment is almost finished.</p><p>\"Just one area left,\" Helena Dunk, the aesthetic nurse practitioner who owns the clinic, Skin HD, reassures her.</p><p>She says polynucleotides have massively increased in popularity over the past 18 months.</p><p>\"Half my clients really notice a huge difference - their skin feels more hydrated, healthier, younger - while the other half don't see such a big change. But their skin does tend to feel tighter and fresher.\"</p><p>Abby has already had the area under her eyes injected as part of a three-course treatment at the clinic - and she's really pleased with the results.</p><p>She received lots of tiny injections of polynucleotides, which was a \"pretty painful procedure\", but says it's helped reduce the dark circles under her eyes.</p><p>While a growing number of studies consider it a safe and effective treatment, it is still relatively new and some experts warn the hype may be outpacing the science.</p><p>Consultant dermatologist Dr John Pagliaro, based in Brisbane, Australia, says that while we know that nucleotides play an important role in our bodies - they are the building blocks of our DNA for a start - he questions whether \"injecting salmon DNA, cut into little pieces\" into our faces is going to work as well as our own nucleotides.</p><p>\"We do not have good, strong data,\" he says. \"As a medical specialist, I would want to see at least a few more years of big, credible studies showing safety and efficacy before I started using them in my practice. We're just not there yet.\"</p><p>Charlotte Bickley describes her foray into the world of polynucleotides as \"salmon-gate\".</p><p>The 31-year-old from New York had the treatment last year as part of her \"wedding glow up\", shortly before she was due to get married.</p><p>But Charlotte ended up with a skin infection, inflammation and darker rings under her eyes than before she had the treatment.</p><p>\"I got the complete opposite of what I wanted,\" she says. \"I trusted that doctor, but he's left me scarred.\"</p><p>Charlotte believes she was injected too deeply under her eyes, causing a negative reaction. There can be side effects - such as redness, swelling and bruising but these tend to be temporary.</p><p>In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction, or, if polynucleotides are not injected properly, there are longer term risks, such as skin pigmentation and infections.</p><p>Polynucleotides are widely used across the UK. They are registered as medical devices with the Medicines Health and Regulatory Authority (MHRA) but they are not regulated like medicines.</p><p>They have not been approved by the UK’s equivalent in the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>\"I just keep thinking, 'Why did I go through with it?'\" Charlotte says. \"When something goes wrong on my face I hyperfixate on it.\"</p><p>She's paid thousands in medical bills to try to rectify the situation, but 10 months on, there's still some scarring below her eyes.</p><p>\"I would never have salmon DNA injected into my face again,\" Charlotte says, \"ever.\"</p><p>Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, an organisation which campaigns for better regulation of the cosmetic industry and who runs a government-approved register of clinics in the UK, says polynucleotides are generally considered a safe treatment when administered by a medically-trained professional and the brand of polynucleotides used is from a reputable company.</p><p>\"But, we are now seeing products coming onto the market that haven't been tested properly, that's the worry,\" she says.</p><p>Dr Sophie Shotter, president of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, agrees.</p><p>\"Due to the lack of regulation, anyone can use products that have not been robustly tested. It is a real issue.\"</p><p>In her opinion, are polynucleotides effective though?</p><p>\"I have them on my shelf, in my toolbox. I definitely offer them to clients, who want a natural look and want to potentially invest long-term,\" Dr Shotter says.</p><p>\"Polynucleotides as a treatment is not the panacea. There are plenty of other treatments out there that can do similar, and have more data behind them.\"</p><p>There is no one treatment that will work for everyone, she adds.</p><p>\"We all respond differently to different things, and that is not always predictable.\"</p><p>Shea Osei says it has been \"meaningful\" to see the film's fans recreate her designs.</p><p>The BBC looks into whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help people who struggle when clothes are oddly sized.</p><p>Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of footwear.</p><p>Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, said Nawat Itsaragrisil was 'not respectful' at a pre-pageant ceremony on Tuesday</p><p>Sales of Korean skincare treatments continue to soar, but some are now made by overseas companies.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>It was at a landmark architecture exhibition in Paris in 1925 that the Art Deco aesthetic first exploded on the scene.</p><p>In the 100 years since, the glamorous building style - evocative of neon-lit jazz bars and the golden age of big motion pictures - rapidly spread around the world.</p><p>It moved from the famous pastel hotel facades of Miami's South Beach to the sprawling necklace of mansion apartments along Mumbai's Marine Drive seafront.</p><p>Art Deco's distinct motifs - typified by geometrical ziggurats (step towers), sweeping curves, sunburst designs, nautical elements and circular or turreted rooftops - symbolised an unequivocal break from the past, celebrating the dawn of a new, unabashed, post-war 20th Century modern age.</p><p>In a short time, the style transcended architecture to influence the design sensibility of home interiors, furniture, fonts, jewellery and some of the world's most iconic cinema halls - from Radio City Music Hall in New York City to Regal, Liberty and Eros cinemas in Mumbai.</p><p>\"It represented hope, optimism and speed, coinciding with the emergence of the motor car and also concrete as a building material, which when compared with stone, could be worked with in a tenth of the time and fifth of the cost,\" Atul Kumar, founder of the Art Deco Mumbai Trust, told the BBC. He's also curator of a new exhibition conceptualised by the Art Deco Alive festival.</p><p>\"It was not elaborate like Victorian Gothic design that preceded it, and came with a classicism and simplicity that has survived the test of time,\" he said.</p><p>And nowhere has that been more apparent than in Mumbai, which, according to Mr Kumar, is home to the world's largest documented collection of Art Deco buildings. Other estimates put Mumbai in the second spot behind Miami.</p><p>What made Mumbai's tryst with Art Deco particularly interesting was how the city embraced its hallmarks in a truly all-encompassing manner.</p><p>Just like Miami, the style emerged in the city at a time of economic flux and transformation, spurred by its modern, mercantile port-city energy.</p><p>But unlike Miami where it \"arrived as a projection of leisure or spectacle\", in Mumbai the \"style resonated across various building typologies, including schools, cinemas, bungalows, petrol stations and banks,\" Mr Kumar said.</p><p>Art Deco buildings in Mumbai were, and still often are, hidden in plain sight, with even their occupants often blissfully unaware of their cultural moorings.</p><p>But their all-pervading architectural shadow over the city is perhaps why Art Deco is \"seeped into the larger public imagination, and remains relevant in Mumbai's emotional quotient\", Mr Kumar added.</p><p>The style was brought to Mumbai at a time when it was under colonial rule.</p><p>It was India's first bunch of home-grown architects - pivotal figures like Chimanlal Master, Laxman Vishnu Sathe and Gopalji Mulji Bhuta - who integrated it into their designs after returning home with degrees from the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.</p><p>\"They were suddenly exposed to new European sensibilities and wanted to bring them back to their country, which was deeply colonised by the imposition of Victorian buildings,\" Mr Kumar said.</p><p>But they adapted Art Deco and vernacularised it, throwing in native design patterns, drawing inspiration from disparate local elements including ocean liners docked at Mumbai's ports and even lattice screens that are so typical of Mughal architecture.</p><p>The British were initially dismissive, calling Art Deco \"lesser architecture\", but were presumably threatened, said Mr Kumar, as it signalled the dawn of a new age and of new identities that were shaping India's public spaces.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before South Mumbai's skyline would become a rich confluence of Indo-Saracenic, Gothic and Art Deco buildings.</p><p>Today, Mumbai is yet again a city in rapid flux - its building code governed by real estate moguls trying to maximise the floor space index, giving way to utilitarian rather than stylistic considerations.</p><p>Dozens of Art Deco buildings have been erased to give way to glass and steel facades, and hundreds more are under threat.</p><p>Over the past decade, Mr Kumar has documented more than 1,500 buildings that are truly representative of the style, but only 70-odd of those are protected.</p><p>Authorities are apathetic to their preservation, so his organisation is engaging directly with people, offering pro-bono repair and restoration consultancies to prevent them from giving away their properties to builders for redevelopment.</p><p>\"The response has been positive as people have seen the value of their real estate go up after the renovations,\" said Mr Kumar.</p><p>Then there are others, like architect and designer Nidhi Tekwani, who is re-imagining Art Deco objects and hoping to adapt them for a contemporary context.</p><p>For example, Art Deco furniture was often bulky, its light fittings were meant for high ceilings, and its dressing tables too elaborate for today's compact apartments. Ms Tekwani aims to design and launch products that are sleeker while preserving core Art Deco principles.</p><p>\"The hope is to translate it to something modern and well-fitting of our current lifestyle requirements,\" said Ms Tekwani of her efforts to keep Art Deco a living tradition in a city that's remaking itself between one blink and the next.</p><p>Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.</p><p>Authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate.</p><p>The veteran Indian actor, often called a 'Greek God', has died.

{"details":"<p>The self-described idyllic life of a family of five living in an Italian forest with horses, donkeys and chickens has stalled after a court ordered the children be removed and placed in foster care.</p><p>Patrol cars were dispatched to remove the children from their home in Abruzzo to a church-run care facility. The mother is staying at the same premise but the parents have limited access to the children, their family lawyer said.</p><p>The fate of the children, known in Italian as the Bimbi nel Bosco or kids in the woods, has captivated the country. Tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition to reunite the family.</p><p>The parents, Nathan Trevallion, a 51-year-old British former professional chef, and Catherine Birmingham, a 45-year-old Australian life coach and former equestrian trainer, were named in an order issued by a L’Aquila court as parents of the children – one eight-year-old and six-year-old twins.</p><p>“The family unit lives in housing hardship as the building has not been declared habitable,” the order states. “The members of the Trevallion family have no social interaction, no fixed income, the home has no toilet facilities, and the children do not attend school. The order is based on the risk of violating the right to social life in consideration of the serious and harmful violations of the children’s rights to physical and mental integrity the parents should be suspended from parental responsibility.”</p><p>Giovanni Angelucci, the family’s lawyer, says the family heats the home with fireplaces and uses solar panels for light and to charge their devices. The family removed running water to avoid microplastics as well as costs and instead draws fresh water from a well on the property. They don’t have an indoor toilet but instead use an outdoor composting toilet.</p><p>The family’s living situation came to light in September 2024 after all five were hospitalized for poisoning after eating wild mushrooms from the forest. After that time, the family was visited by social service officials and law enforcement, but their lawyer said they did not comply with recommendations to have the children receive regular medical care and attend schools.</p><p>Trevallion told local media at the time he was shocked by the decision. “They are happy, smell good, well-mannered, and well-fed; why break this bond?” he said Friday, according to La Repubblica newspaper. CNN reached out to the family via Birmingham’s website, which advises that they don’t check electronic communications often.</p><p>Angelluci said the family will appeal the decision next week.</p><p>Birmingham runs a life coaching and energy reading business, according to her website, which is filled with images of animals and the children – photos the court order said violated the children’s privacy and were posted only to show the appearance of a normal living situation after the social services’ investigation began.</p><p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her deputy Matteo Salvini have both criticized the court decision. Meloni, who said the removal of the children was “alarming,” has called the Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio over the case, according to her spokesman.</p><p>Salvini, who plans to visit the family home next week, told reporters at the Venice Bienniele on Friday that it was “shameful that the State is concerned with private education and the personal life choices of two parents who found Italy a hospitable country, yet it steals their children.”</p><p>The family purchased the home in 2021, at which time Birmingham wrote on her website, “Recently we found our dream forever home. … With the energy of the place being very special, we bring people to stay for healing and awakening, connecting to the wild, without and within, eating home grown and home cooked organic vegan food.”</p><p>Giuseppe Masciulli, the mayor of nearby Palmoli, also condemned the removal of the children. “I’m a father myself, so I was deeply shocked by the situation,” he told CNN, adding that he believed the situation could be resolved if the family promises to meet certain requirements, including reinstalling running water and meeting with the local school on a weekly basis to assess the children’s academic progress.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Rupert Grint has told the BBC he’s unlikely to ever \"step out\" of Ron Weasley's shadow, some 14 years after the release of the final Harry Potter film.</p><p>\"I'm fine with that. I think it's great,\" he said. \"I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood.\"</p><p>Grint, 37, who played Ron in all eight of the franchise's movies, also revealed he has written a letter to the child actor playing Ron in the upcoming TV series.</p><p>\"It's quite strange to have the cycle happening again,\" he said. \"I'm really intrigued what it's going to be like.\"</p><p>Grint was speaking to BBC News at an event to switch on the Christmas lights in Highgate, north London, on Wednesday.</p><p>The actor, who lives locally with his partner, actress Georgia Groome, and their two daughters, drew a crowd of fans to the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution and Highgate Society.</p><p>As children, Grint and his co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had their lives transformed by their wizarding roles in the big-screen adaptation of JK Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.</p><p>Grint was 11 when he was cast as Ron - who is characterised as one of Harry Potter's best friends at Hogwarts - and now describes the experience as being \"crazy\".</p><p>\"It changed my whole life quite quickly,\" he said. \"I was a huge fan of the books, so for me it was like stepping into the books, and that was very special.\"</p><p>Grint has switched on the Christmas lights in Highgate in the past as well.</p><p>The festive free event was arranged by volunteers from the local community and funded by local businesses, schools and residents.</p><p>Since the Potter films ended, Grint has had roles in films including Into the White, and in Apple TV series Servant. He's also appeared on stage, and in a number of Ed Sheeran's music videos.</p><p>He told us he has \"a couple of things\" coming up next year, though he is not able to talk about them yet.</p><p>But compared with Radcliffe and Watson, Grint has found it relatively hard to break out of his Potter role.</p><p>Is he fed up of always being linked to a part he played decades ago? \"No, absolutely not, I love it,\" he said.</p><p>\"It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It's great. It gives me a lot of pride. It was such a huge thing.</p><p>\"I don't think I'll ever quite step out of his shadow, but I'm fine with that.\"</p><p>The three child actors who will play Harry, Ron and Hermione in the new HBO series were announced in May.</p><p>Earlier this week, Radcliffe revealed he had sent a letter to Dominic McLaughlin, who is taking over the role of Harry.</p><p>McLaughlin, 11, is also starring in a new iPlayer drama, Gifted, which starts on Monday on CBBC and iPlayer.</p><p>Grint told us he has also written a letter to Alastair Stout, who will play Ron.</p><p>\"I wrote him a letter, before they started, passing the baton as it were,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience,\" he said.</p><p>Grint said that when the new actors were announced, it took him \"straight back\" to when he, Radcliffe and Watson were cast. \"I still remember every second of it,\" he said.</p><p>He sees \"a bit of family resemblance\" between himself and Stout.</p><p>\"I think it's great that it's a whole new thing. It's going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun,\" he added.</p><p>He wouldn't discourage his children if they wanted to take on roles in the TV adaptation in the future, though.</p><p>\"I don't see why not. It was so much fun,\" he said.</p><p>Grint added the films were \"still a little bit too scary\" for his five-year-old daughter, named Wednesday, but she has watched some clips. \"And she loves it,\" he added.</p><p>While Grint has largely been less prolific since the heyday of the Harry Potter films, in 2020, he was one of several stars of the Potter franchise who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author spoke out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.</p><p>As a row grew, the writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.</p><p>In September, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refused to \"cancel her out\" despite their differences on the subject.</p><p>But her remarks were met with a stinging response from Rowling, who dismissed her as \"ignorant\".</p><p>Grint, for his part, declined to comment on the row when we asked him about it on Wednesday.</p><p>Could the future spell a return to wizardry for Grint? When asked whether he would follow in the footsteps of co-star Tom Felton - who recently returned as Draco Malfoy on Broadway - he said: \"Maybe in the future. Never say never.\"</p><p>\"But for now, I think as much as I loved it, I'm enjoying stepping outside of that world,\" he added - even as Ron's shadow looms large.</p><p>And if that wizardry could offer him the benefit of hindsight, which Hogwarts house would he be sorted into?</p><p>\"I think I'm probably more Hufflepuff than Gryffindor,\" he admits.</p><p>\"I like the vibe of Hufflepuff, I think. But Gryffindor is a close second.\"</p><p>The veteran Indian actor, often called a 'Greek God', has died.

{"details":"<p>Hidden for decades from public view, the artist's Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer has now sold at auction for a record sum. Why is it so valuable?</p><p>A mysterious and relatively little-known painting by Gustav Klimt is now the most expensive work of modern art ever to sell at auction and the most expensive ever to be sold by Sotheby's. The teasingly complex canvas, a full-length portrait of Elisabeth Lederer, the daughter of the Austrian artist's most committed patrons, fetched $236.4m (£180m) in New York on 18 November, far outpacing the price paid two years ago for Klimt's Lady with a Fan, 1917-18, which broke records when it sold for $108m (£82m) in London in 2023, making it the most expensive painting ever sold at auction in Europe.</p><p>The sale saw Klimt's canvas pass Andy Warhol's portrait of Marilyn Monroe, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, 1964 (which sold at Christie's in New York in 2022 for $195m), to become the second priciest work of art ever to go under the hammer, behind Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World), c 1500, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m (£343m). But what is it about this nearly 2m-tall likeness of a 20 year-old heiress, whose eerily elongated figure seems to chrysalise in a cocoon-like gown of shimmering white silk, that commands such a jaw-dropping price tag?</p><p>On its surface, Bildnis Elisabeth Lederer (Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer), 1914-16, may seem to lack the overt opulence of better-known paintings from Klimt's so-called \"Golden Period\", the era in which he produced such glimmering works as his Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, 1907, and The Kiss, 1907-8. Where those sumptuous masterpieces glisten with the glamour of the Vienna Secession (the influential movement emphasising artistic freedom that Klimt helped found), the lyrical likeness of Lederer, created in the last years of the artist's life (Klimt died in 1918, aged 55), pulses with a more psychologically teasing intensity. The canvas's aesthetic riches are copious, if more concealed.</p><p>Seized by Nazi officials, who confiscated the Lederer's vast collection of Klimts after Austria's annexation in 1938, the portrait resurfaced into the market in the early 1980s. It was then that it entered the private holdings of the billionaire heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics fortune, Leonard A Lauder, who died in June 2025. Hidden for decades from public view, the portrait has, in a sense, been biding its time, waiting to return to the spotlight. Whatever the price tag, the mysterious work is poised finally to reveal its secrets. Its extraordinary story blurs fact and symbolism into a richly charged visual tapestry whose intrigue extends into and outside the painting's surface.</p><p>Undertaken in the opening years of World War One, the portrait's prismatic exaltation of Lederer – the daughter of August and Serena Lederer, one of Vienna's wealthiest Jewish families – can be read as the last glorious gasp of the Golden Age from which it emerged. At first glance, the elaborate array of deceptively ornamental East Asian-influenced motifs – that orbit the young woman in a dazzling timeless stage of celestial blue – and the implosive calm of her dark eyes transport us from the accelerating turmoil of European history, transcending time and place. The audacity of gold on which Klimt previously relied has not so much disappeared as been transmuted, in a kind of reverse alchemy, into a fearlessness of vibrant, evocative colour that borders on the boldness of Expressionism.</p><p>Look closer and the portrait bristles with teasing and culturally complex details. Within the design of Elisabeth's elaborate robe and gown, Klimt has woven an enchanting conspiracy of shapes. These echo the contours of symbols and forms drawn eclectically from East Asian art and from the world of microscopic medical imagery that was just coming into sharper focus within the scientific circles in which Klimt moved in Vienna. The dragons on her robe are reminiscent of Qing Dynasty textiles, where such creatures represent cosmic authority and the divinely sanctioned authority of the emperor. Their slow, circling movement around Elisabeth's thighs, rising from stylised waves, gives her an almost mythic presence as a tamer of the elements and supernatural beasts. By immortalising Elisabeth's beauty in such mythic terms, Klimt is not simply flattering his patrons. He is, in effect, reinventing Botticelli's Birth of Venus for a new age.</p><p>More like this:</p><p>• Why this 1768 painting could be the birth of modern art</p><p>• The clues hidden in a true crime masterpiece</p><p>• Why there's more to Man Ray's iconic nude than it seems</p><p>But there's more. Offsetting this grand, imported iconography from East Asia are subtler shapes that call to mind the infinitesimal biomorphic forms with which Klimt became preoccupied while attending lectures on cell theory and anatomy delivered by his friend Emil Zuckerkandl, the Chair of Anatomy and Pathology at the University of Vienna, in 1903. A closer look at Elisabeth's intricate garments reveals a scatter of ovoid and concentric circles that can easily be dismissed as mere floral decoration. These soft, looping amorphous forms and cell-like motifs rhyme richly with similar shapes that appear in several of Klimt's earlier works, where writers have linked their presence to the artist's growing interest in embryology, haematology, and the structures of early life.</p><p>Read across such works, including Klimt's earlier paintings Danaë, 1907, and The Kiss, these cellular shapes begin to cohere into an inchoate language that only Klimt could coin. By juxtaposing symbols of imperial power with hints of biological origins and bloodlines, he creates a portrait that works on ever deepening levels of ancient mythology and modern science.</p><p>More remarkably still, these subtle references to lineage and identity cast an uncanny light on what happened to Elisabeth years later, under Nazi rule. Decades after Klimt's death, in the late 1930s, Elisabeth found herself facing increasing restrictions and growing peril because of her Jewish ancestry. In an extraordinary act of self-preservation, she falsely claimed that Klimt, a non-Jewish artist known for his many romantic affairs, was in fact her biological father. Elisabeth's mother, Serena, corroborated her daughter's fabricated claim by signing a sworn affidavit. The authorities accepted the fiction and granted Elisabeth a revised status that protected her.</p><p>Elisabeth's story, both inside and outside the frame of Klimt's mysterious portrait, is one of extraordinary transformation, rebirth and metamorphic survival. Zoom back out from the tight tease of subtle shapes that define the texture of the exquisite garments that Klimt wove for her, and the young woman's very physique seems surreally to mirror the proportions of a butterfly (a recurring motif in Klimt's art) just breaking free from its silken chrysalis. Her colourful gown, falling elegantly behind her, suddenly has the look of slick, prismatic wings about to spread dazzlingly wide. Whether Klimt's late masterpiece is deserving of the astonishing sum it has just fetched, there is little doubting the power and pricelessness of his portrait's endlessly regenerative genius.</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Artist Dasic Fernández turns grey streets in New York, Santiago and Diriyah into colorful 3D landscapes.</p><p>Find out how the ornate ceramics known as Iznik tiles hold the key to a forgotten golden age of Turkish art.</p><p>Ancient documents made with washi, the hand-crafted Japanese paper, are proof of its remarkable longevity.</p><p>Passed down through generations in Gokayama, the Japanese tradition of Kokiriko honours the cycle of life.</p><p>The Japanese photographer who buried hundreds of photos and the journey to revive his legacy.</p><p>How America's first professional female tattooist broke through into an art form historically dominated by men.</p><p>BBC Click visits a simulator lab that allows musicians to practice performance in real-world conditions.</p><p>BBC Click heads behind the scenes of the Sydney Opera House to explore the tech powering the famous landmark.</p><p>In 1948 a famous artist and an innovative portrait photographer attempted to create something unbelievable.</p><p>Find out how Japan's renowned Wajima-nuri lacquerware is crafted through more than 100 intricate steps.</p><p>The BBC gets access to Michelangelo's 'secret hiding room' under the Medici Chapel in Florence.</p><p>We find out how AI blurs the line between creation and automation, raising questions about the essence of art.</p><p>The prehistoric paintings in Magura Cave in Bulgaria are made using a surprising material.</p><p>The 'Shahmaran', half-woman and half-snake, is a mythical figure popular in the folklore of Turkey.</p><p>Discreetly located in a sleepy Venetian square, Palazzo Fortuny surprises whomever ventures in.</p><p>Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has enjoyed one of the longest careers in operatic history.</p><p>Zeinab Badawi heads to Athens to celebrate the centenary of the birth of opera soprano Maria Callas.</p><p>Art critic Alastair Sooke travels to Doha to discover some of the treasures of the Museum of Islamic Art.</p><p>Art critic Alastair Sooke learns about a decorative 10th-Century treasure at Doha's Museum of Islamic Art.</p><p>Art critic Alastair Sooke learns about a masterpiece of the Islamic world at Doha's Museum of Islamic Art.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>In Marseille, France’s most diverse city, a new wave of restaurants is redefining fine dining by blending haute cuisine with community solidarity.</p><p>Behind the ornate facade of Marseille restaurant Le République, lunch service is in full swing. Smoked mullet with sea fennel butter arrives as a starter, invoking the salty history of France's second city. Hay-smoked cheese with rice flour follows, singing with flavour from the surrounding Provençal countryside. Tourists and locals savour organic ingredients prepared by Michelin-starred chef Sébastien Richard.</p><p>But Le République is a gourmet restaurant with a few big differences. First, the staff include a recently released prisoner. Second, around 40% of diners will pay just €1 for their three-course feast. And, finally, several diners have never set foot inside a restaurant before.</p><p>Le République is a restaurant solidaire – one of around 10 in Marseille – run as a social enterprise in aid of community solidarity. Other examples include L'Après M, a former McDonald's taken over by its redundant staff when the franchise closed. The team purchased the premises and reopened it as a social enterprise, serving gourmet burgers created by a three-star Michelin chef served to the beat of Algerian rap, while operating a free food-delivery service of healthy takeout for people in need.</p><p>Marseille's newest restaurant solidaire is Chaleur, which opened in June 2025. When I visited, it was packed with patrons enjoying chilled cucumber soup adorned with clams, figs and roasted pumpkin seeds. A blowout lunch with wine costs around €25 (£21; $29). But if a patron explains that they're in a penurious position, they can enjoy the exact same menu for a tarif suspend – a \"suspended rate\" – of just €8 (£6.90; $9.29). Across Marseille, prices vary by philosophy. Some, like Le République, partner with charities to subsidise €1 meals, while others, like Chaleur, operate on trust.</p><p>Chaleur's popularity begs an obvious question: with food this tasty, why not make a profit?</p><p>\"Benevolence is a selfish way of saying that I want to be fulfilled in what I do,\" says Chaleur co-founder Raphaël Raynard. \"What enriches us is knowing our work is contributing to creating connections and helping people.\" The team regularly serves espressos to homeless neighbours and recently donated 300 meals to a workers' strike.</p><p>Chaleur's co-founder Nausicaa Roux believes Marseille's status as a \"lighthouse city\" is key to understanding the popularity of restaurants solidaires. Around 2,600 years of migration – including Greeks settlers in classical times to Iberian Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition and Armenians in the 20th Century – has made Marseille one of France's most diverse and religiously tolerant cities.</p><p>\"As a result, there's a real way of living together that I don't think exists in Paris or London,\" Roux said. \"Folks feel duty bound to help the one in five Marseillais who are born abroad. \"There is an openness not found in other cities in France.\"</p><p>These emigres didn't arrive empty handed. They carried ingredients like orange blossom water from the Middle East, which is used to make Marseille's iconic navette biscuits. Dates entered Europe via the Vieux Port, the city's ancient harbour, and probably tomatoes and bananas too. The dynamic city dialect includes words in Amazigh, Occitan and Italian, with phrases blending together like a linguistic bouillabaisse, the local fish stew made from imported saffron and regional seafood. Marseille is, quite literally, a global melting pot.</p><p>Thanks to Marseille's culinary history, food is Marseille's most powerful social tool. Few districts need it more than La Cabucelle, the city's former soap-making area, located high above the Vieux Port. Here, incomes hover around €975 (£849; $1131) per month – some €500 less than the Marseille average – and there's no youth centre or social space. That's why Léna Cardo opened her restaurant-daycare-social space Le Réfectoire, which started serving organic meals in April 2024.</p><p>Le Réfectoire's large, white-washed interior is a restaurant, library, nursery and information exchange rolled into one. \"Every Monday, we have a history teacher,\" says Cardo. \"She voluntarily gives up her time to teach French history to a dozen mums.\" Every Tuesday, a counsellor offers employment advice for free. \"We can be a place for a parent to learn French or a young adult to find a job.\"</p><p>However, what keeps customers coming back is Le Réfectoire's sublime food. Daily specials cost around €12, with recent offerings including a sea bream fillet on a bed of Provençal potatoes and tabbouleh topped with a goat's cheese galette. On Wednesdays, local chefs originally hailing from countries like Congo and Morocco take turns in the kitchen and share the revenue. Any excess profit is funnelled into local socio-cultural activities.</p><p>More like this:</p><p>• Is the future of French cheese at stake?</p><p>• Marseille: France's 'good natured' city</p><p>• The French Riviera's picture-perfect car-free island escape</p><p>Travellers are slowly discovering La Cabucelle, with its Moorish facades and Armenian churches. Everyday bar Monday, an epic Marché aux Puces (flea market) bustles with antiques, home clearance treasures and vintage Olympique de Marseille football jerseys. Cardo hopes they will book Le Réfectoire when they come. \"If you're buying something here,\" she says, \"you give money for activities to people who need them.\"</p><p>The walk from La Cabucelle to Marseille's rejuvenated docklands feels like a veritable world tour. E-scooters flit like barracudas through streets serving Tunisian lablabi soup and Comoran breadfruit crisps. An influencer could hook 1,000 followers with snapshots of Laotian spring rolls and staircases painted in colourful rainbows. In the docks themselves, ferries make nightly runs to Tangier, Tunis and Algiers, while container ships arrive from around the world.</p><p>Back at Le République, chefs are preparing evening starters like leek vinaigrette with a Parmesan biscuit and grated bottarga. Aside from serving €1 meals to diners in need of nutritious cuisine, the restaurant's central theme is \"insertion professionnelle\" – helping marginalised people back into work.</p><p>\"[We've employed] people with autism, single mothers who haven't been able to work for 20 years, people who can't read,\" says Sylvain Martin, who co-founded the restaurant with chef Sébastien Richard. \"We have had so many profiles that I can't list them all!\"</p><p>Some staff have come to Le République from Baumettes Prison, Marseille's toughest jail, where the last person in the Western world to be executed by guillotine took place in 1977. The prison is now home to Marseille's most curious restaurant solidaire, Les Beaux Mets, which translates as \"the beautiful dishes\" and is a play on the maximum security penitentiary's name. The fine-dining restaurant, open for lunch only, was created by the godfather of Marseille cuisine, Gérald Passedat (also the brains behind the L'Après M's gourmet burger) after learning that former offenders tended to return to crime in the absence of meaningful work.</p><p>\"Taking people from Baumettes is one of the hardest insertions we have,\" admits Martin. \"They say yes to anything until the judge is confident enough to release them.\" He says that some ex-prisoners fail to show up for work but the ones that apply themselves are \"very, very motivated\", having learnt teamwork and timekeeping skills behind bars. The prison confirmed that 75% of inmates who trained at the prison restaurant achieved employment or training upon release, thanks in large part to Le République.</p><p>The evening service at Le République ends with a turmeric-golden poached pear topped with tongue-numbing Sichuan pepper. There's an unspoken question at the caisse (counter): how can anyone enjoy a €1 dinner?</p><p>\"We have signed agreements with 100 charities who can book a meal at the price,\" explains Martin. All patrons receive their bill discreetly after dining together, ensuring dignity for those paying a reduced tariff.</p><p>And what if a diner games the system to bag a discount meal?</p><p>\"If you are selfish enough to cheat, then do it,\" says Martin. \"It's your problem every morning in front of the mirror.\"</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Originating in Topkapi Palace where it delighted Ottoman sultans, this delicacy has a surprising ingredient.</p><p>'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.</p><p>The Braai tradition in South Africa is more than just a BBQ, it's a phenomenon that ties the nation together.</p><p>Mangal 2, a fixture on the London food scene, is redefining Turkish cuisine in a city constantly evolving.</p><p>AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.</p><p>Food writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.</p><p>At Michelin-starred Semma, chef Vijay Kumar brings deeply personal dishes from his childhood to the plate.</p><p>At Icca, Japanese sushi master chef Kazushige Suzuki blends ancient methods with other cuisines.</p><p>As part of its mission, Silo uses a nose to tail and root to tip approach to cooking out of respect for nature.</p><p>The menu at the Icehotel, the world's first hotel made out of ice and snow, is served on plates of ice.</p><p>How this one simple mistake gave birth to the 50-billion-dollar US chicken industry.</p><p>London's Darjeeling Express is ground zero for chef Asma Khan, a champion of women's empowerment.</p><p>Foraging is one of Finland's favourite hobbies and an essential part of the culture.</p><p>Floating in the middle of a Norwegian fjord, Restaurant Iris takes diners on an 'experiential dining' journey.</p><p>Deniseea Taylor is a mixologist who teaches what she jokingly calls 'drunk Black History'.</p><p>Taste of China: How chef Andrew Wong takes diners on a culinary journey across China's provinces.</p><p>Reel takes you to Italy to explore how the world's rarest and most expensive ingredient ends up on our tables.</p><p>What we eat, it turns out, can have an impact on how well our memory works.</p><p>American baker and chef Nancy Silverton explains the difference between British and American scones.</p><p>A huge recall of frozen fruits is currently happening across the US due to contamination fears.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>In New Orleans, people are used to having their resilience tested.</p><p>There was Hurricane Katrina, the BP oil spill, a major hotel collapse, a vicious early pandemic surge and a terror attack during the 2025 New Year’s celebrations.</p><p>Now immigrants and organizers say they’re preparing for what feels like may be another disaster heading for their community: Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and roughly 250 federal agents are expected to launch an immigration enforcement operation in the city starting the first week of December, according to two sources familiar with the planning. Advocates and residents told CNN they’re preparing a bit like they would for one of the hurricanes that have ravaged the sinking city.</p><p>“The immigrant community is feeling absolute panic and terrified,” Rachel Taber, a volunteer with Unión Migrante, an immigrant-led advocacy group, said. “People are treating it like a hurricane as much as they can, buying groceries, staying in the house, planning not to be able to go to work.”</p><p>The 307-year-old city, a blue enclave in a Republican-led state, will be the latest target of the Department of Homeland Security’s operations, according to those two sources, part of the president’s pledge to enact mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>In response to questions from CNN about the operation, DHS sent a statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: “For the safety and security of law enforcement, we’re not going to telegraph potential operations.”</p><p>With honking horns and locked doors, here’s how one Charlotte community faced the immigration enforcement crackdown</p><p>Operations in other cities have featured the armed, masked federal agents and unmarked vehicles that have become a hallmark of immigration enforcement under the second Trump administration. The agents have also been criticized over their use of force against both US citizens and non-citizens, including shootings, tear gas and flash bangs.</p><p>About 23,400 immigrants make the Cresent City their home — roughly 6.5% of the total population, according to data from the US Census. Over half of those are non-citizens.</p><p>Around half of New Orleans’ immigrant population is from Latin America, according to Census data. And immigrants’ share of the population is smaller than in other cities where Bovino has led arrests.</p><p>But organizers and immigrant workers told CNN they’re the backbone of the city, helping maintain the service industry that welcomes millions of visitors each year. They cook the Creole and Cajun food that makes the city a culinary destination, and they clean the hotel rooms that host tourists visiting for Mardi Gras.</p><p>Immigrants also played a crucial role in the reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina left 80% of the city underwater in 2005. Around half of the reconstruction workforce after the hurricane were Latino and a quarter were undocumented immigrants, primarily from Mexico and Honduras, a study from the University of California, Berkeley Human Rights Center found. Today, the city’s Hispanic population is twice what it was before Katrina.</p><p>Now some of the city’s immigrant workers feel afraid they too will be caught up in the Trump administration’s sprawling deportation campaign.</p><p>Trump administration ‘inadvertently’ deported transgender woman to Mexico despite judge’s concern she may face torture there</p><p>At Tia Maria’s Kitchen, Jose Almendares strives to make authentic Honduran food the way his mother taught him: Baleadas made from handmade tortillas filled with beans, cheese, crema and avocado; fried sweet plantains; and pastelitos stuffed with fragrant meat and potatoes.</p><p>It’s made his restaurant a nexus for the local Latino community.</p><p>But in the past week, they’ve been short-staffed as employees say they’re scared to come to work with rumors of Border Patrol in town. On Saturday, which would usually be bustling, Almendares had to close early because there weren’t enough staff to cover the evening shift. He’s trying his best to make up the difference himself, working extra hours to fill the gaps in staffing.</p><p>For immigrants in the city, there’s “a lot of anxiety and uncertainty, because you’ve seen what’s going on in other cities,” he said. “And a lot of people are scared and they’re hiding.” He’s given his crew informal trainings on what to do if they’re stopped by federal agents, teaching them about their Fifth Amendment rights and urging them to always call a lawyer if needed.</p><p>The tension is personal for Almendares: He’s a Honduran immigrant who is protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. “I’m choosing not to live fearful or scared, I know my rights,” he said.</p><p>Ingrid Ferguson, who owns five grocery stores with a focus on Central American products in New Orleans, says she and her family have had to pick up extra shifts because their immigrant employees are scared to come to work — even those with work permits.</p><p>Daily revenue has dropped by almost half in the last week, she said, a change she attributed to lower foot traffic as Latinos in the city — the core of her customer base — are hunkering down at home. She’s started offering free delivery, her way of “trying to do what we can do.”</p><p>She’s considering temporarily closing all but one store next week if the staffing problem continues — a devastating step for the business she spent nine years building.</p><p>“Every single day I’ve been working so hard to get to this point,” she said. “To close the doors — it’s going to be very, very hard.”</p><p>Ferguson, a naturalized US citizen who has spent over 20 years in the country, says the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement has made her consider returning to Honduras for the first time.</p><p>Coming to the US and building a flourishing business to support her family, “I realized my American dream,” she said. But now, “we don’t feel safe and don’t feel good anymore to be here … We want to, you know, not feel that they’re gonna come and catch me when I open my door.”</p><p>Pope Leo calls US treatment of immigrants ‘disrespectful’</p><p>And the Mexico-born owner of a construction company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing worries she or her family could be targeted by DHS, told CNN several of her contracts are effectively paralyzed as the immigrant employees she usually works with are frightened to report to work.</p><p>“Obviously the people are so scared,” she said. And as a Spanish-speaking “brown” immigrant herself, even though she has legal status, she’s worried she’ll be targeted.</p><p>Her company focuses on stucco and plaster, she said, which requires specialized workers, many of whom have been honing their skills for years. It’s impossible to replace them on short notice.</p><p>Lindsey Navarro, the founder and executive director of El Centro, a nonprofit that helps members of New Orleans’ Latino community open businesses, said she expects the restaurant and hospitality sectors to be most affected by staffing shortages ahead of the upcoming operation.</p><p>“People are really buckling down, and they’re just not willing to risk deportation,” she said.</p><p>At the same time, Navarro said she’s been heartened by an upswell of activism as the city braces for the operation. Residents are learning from the strategies used in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, where locals mobilized other community members, training them on how to respond if they observe immigration enforcement actions.</p><p>There’s “this willingness and want to fight for the rights” of immigrants, she said.</p><p>She’s helped hand out whistle kits — which activists in other cities have used to report sightings of immigration officers — and signs for business owners to designate certain areas employees-only. So far, volunteers have distributed over 1,500 whistle kits, which include whistles, instructions, and “Know Your Rights” cards, according to Mich Gonzalez, a founding member of the Southeast Dignity Not Detention coalition, an immigrants’ advocacy group.</p><p>Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apart</p><p>Taber, the organizer with Unión Migrante, said the organization hosted free immigration consultations with lawyers and helped people sign power of attorney letters and custody forms in case parents are separated from their children. Organizers helped immigrant parents of US citizen children apply for passports for their children, too, in case they need to travel to be reunited.</p><p>Gonzalez told CNN, “This city is filled with people who have deep culture, deep roots in organizing.”</p><p>Immigrants “are an integrated part of this city, absolutely, and most people right now are thinking about how to support them, how to help them,” he said. He added the distrust in the government left after its botched response to Hurricane Katrina has created a culture where residents look out for each other. Federal aid took days to arrive as tens of thousands of people were stranded without food or water in the aftermath of the storm.</p><p>“This is a city that is very accustomed to the federal government abandoning it when its people need it the most,” he said.</p><p>In pictures: Hurricane Katrina</p><p>New Orleans has been on the administration’s radar for months, with President Donald Trump floating the idea of sending in the National Guard in September. A Border Patrol operation there would follow Charlotte as the latest Democratic-led city in a Republican-led state where Bovino has led targeted, intense immigration enforcement efforts.</p><p>CNN asked Bovino last month how he chooses the destinations for his crackdowns.</p><p>“We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”</p><p>The Crescent City and surrounding region is familiar territory for Bovino, who led the Border Patrol’s New Orleans Sector during Trump’s first term. The sector includes hundreds of miles of Gulf Coast across half a dozen states.</p><p>The city’s mayor-elect Helena Moreno, a Democrat born in Mexico, told CNN affiliate WWL she’s watching closely as the operation looms even as she’s received little information from federal officials.</p><p>“You have parents who are scared to send their children to school,” said Moreno. “At my church,” she said, “there is a one o’clock service, Spanish-speaking service every Sunday, that keeps getting smaller and smaller.

{"details":"<p>In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive.</p><p>Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated.</p><p>The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the \"COP of truth\".</p><p>The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat</p><p>But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted.</p><p>And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting.</p><p>Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible.</p><p>So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP.</p><p>The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations.</p><p>Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that.</p><p>While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return.</p><p>Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas.</p><p>To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion.</p><p>It made matters worse.</p><p>Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy.</p><p>The EU were given short shrift by major producers.</p><p>\"We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,\" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer.</p><p>Ouch!</p><p>Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP.</p><p>These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain.</p><p>They are the richest group of nations still in the Paris Agreement but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour.</p><p>While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of.</p><p>The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft.</p><p>The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the \"tripling\" word stayed in the text.</p><p>So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in.</p><p>\"Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,\" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics.</p><p>\"This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union.\"</p><p>The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front.</p><p>The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself.</p><p>Two often heard positions:</p><p>How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words?</p><p>How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks?</p><p>The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore.</p><p>\"We can't discard it entirely,\" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News.</p><p>\"But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far.\"</p><p>Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people.</p><p>It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore.</p><p>Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an \"implementation cop\" and put a lot of focus on the \"energy agenda\". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant.</p><p>COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance.</p><p>For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an \"orchestrated\" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G.</p><p>'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking.</p><p>The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it.</p><p>They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - \"unilateral\" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive.</p><p>The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad.</p><p>If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves.</p><p>Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials.</p><p>The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization.</p><p>The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways.</p><p>US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here.</p><p>Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals.</p><p>And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels.</p><p>\"China kept a low political profile,\" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society.</p><p>\"And they focussed on making money in the real world.\"</p><p>\"Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position.\"</p><p>Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

{"details":"<p>Following bitter rows, the UN climate summit COP30 in Belém, Brazil has ended with a deal that contains no direct reference to the fossil fuels that are heating up the planet.</p><p>It is a frustrating end for more than 80 countries including the UK and EU that wanted the meeting to commit the world to stop using using oil, coal and gas at a faster pace.</p><p>But oil-producing nations held the line that they should be allowed to use their fossil fuel resources to grow their economies.</p><p>The meeting takes place as the UN says it fears global efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels have failed.</p><p>A representative for Colombia furiously criticised the COP presidency for not allowing countries to object to the deal in the final meeting on Saturday, known as a plenary.</p><p>\"Colombia believes that we have sufficient scientific evidence saying that more than 75% of the global greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels,\" Daniela Durán González, Colombian Climate Delegate, told BBC News.</p><p>\"So we do believe it's time that the Convention on Climate Change starts talking about that reality,\" she added.</p><p>The final deal, called the Mutirão, calls on countries to \"voluntarily\" accelerate their  action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.</p><p>For the first time, the US did not send a delegation after President Donald Trump said the country will leave the landmark Paris treaty that committed countries to act on climate change in 2015.

{"details":"<p>At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter.</p><p>India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being \"worryingly inadequate\". Delhi has argued otherwise.</p><p>Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming.</p><p>So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones.</p><p>The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement.</p><p>But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the climate plans submitted to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies.</p><p>UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets.</p><p>The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it.</p><p>All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap.</p><p>But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem.</p><p>Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December.</p><p>So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30?</p><p>Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world.</p><p>A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that \"global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone\".</p><p>\"For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,\" he wrote.</p><p>While delivering India's statement at COP30, Yadav seemed to expand on this argument.</p><p>\"Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,\" he said.</p><p>Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries.</p><p>The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue.</p><p>The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn.</p><p>Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans.</p><p>Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot.</p><p>\"The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,\" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30.</p><p>Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states.</p><p>India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline.</p><p>Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges.</p><p>Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as \"highly insufficient\".</p><p>It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C.</p><p>Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal.</p><p>In the Climate Change Performance Index, published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU.</p><p>\"India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,\" a report by the think-tank noted.</p><p>According to the recent UN emissions gap report, India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia.</p><p>But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan.</p><p>And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends.</p><p>The veteran Indian actor, often called a 'Greek God', has died.

{"details":"<p>It’s easy to tell when it’s smog season in New Delhi; the air gets darker, heavier and starts scratching the throats and testing the lungs of the city’s 34 million residents.</p><p>Pollution been an issue for so long in the Indian capital that the city’s famous Red Fort is turning black, an outward sign of a growing health and political crisis that’s now bringing angry residents onto the streets.</p><p>“I just want to be able to breathe again,” said Sofie, 33, at a protest near Delhi’s India Gate earlier this month. “There seems to be no political will to fix the issue,” she added, surrounded by dozens of protesters wearing face masks and carrying nebulizers.</p><p>Successive Delhi governments have had air pollution plans dating back to 1996, but decades on, the air remains dangerously unhealthy, especially at this time of year when colder air traps smoke and fumes from fireworks, crop-burning and heavy city traffic.</p><p>The struggle to clean India’s air stands in contrast to nearby China, where a multi-billion dollar and years-long effort to crack down on the country’s notoriously polluted skies has paid significant dividends.</p><p>New Delhi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government insists it’s taking action, and last month launched an expensive – and unsuccessful – cloud seeding experiment to wash away the toxic air.</p><p>Pollution levels are now at “hazardous” levels, according to IQAir, which regularly puts Delhi at the top of its list of major cities with the world’s worst air quality.</p><p>“Imagine the impact of that on a baby’s lungs,” said Dr Vandana Prasad, a pediatrician at the protest. “Children are forced to go to school in these circumstances, and even masks aren’t recommended for kids below 12,” she said.</p><p>“We are literally killing our kids.”</p><p>Small aircraft hummed over the city’s skies late last month, firing flares into clouds to shower them with small quantities of silver iodide and sodium chloride compounds.</p><p>India has used cloud seeding technology to create rain in other parts of the country, but never to curb pollution. It’s part of a pricey promise made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which took office in New Delhi earlier this year.</p><p>“I want to tell Delhi’s citizens that the government has installed anti-smog guns on high-rise buildings, done dust mitigation with water sprinklers, we are monitoring ongoing constructions,” environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in a statement.</p><p>However, “10 years of damage cannot be undone in 7 months,” Sirsa added, as he attempted to shift the blame to the previous government.</p><p>Three attempts at cloud seeding last month “did not achieve success” because there wasn’t enough precipitation in the air, according to Manindra Agarwal, director of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, which worked with the government on the cloud seeding project.</p><p>Scientists say cloud seeding can induce rain only when enough moisture is already present in the atmosphere. On the day of the tests, it was around 15%, Agarwal said.</p><p>Two more trials were planned; however, they’ve since been postponed, partly due to insufficient moisture in the clouds, IIT Kanpur said in a statement.</p><p>The capital woke up to a thick layer of smog on October 20, after residents celebrated Diwali, setting off fireworks for the Indian festival of lights. As the air quality deteriorated, the Delhi government greenlit cloud seeding, despite warnings from experts that the probability of success was low.</p><p>“Effective cloud seeding requires specific cloud conditions, which are generally absent during Delhi’s cold and dry winter months,” experts said in a letter to the environment minister.</p><p>“Even if suitable clouds were present, the dry atmospheric layer beneath them could cause any developed precipitation to evaporate before reaching the surface,” said the letter, from the Indian Meteorological Department, Commission for Air Quality Management in the national capital region (NCR) and Adjoining areas and the Central Pollution Control Board.</p><p>“This is honestly the worst possible choice to mitigate air pollution,” M Rajeevan, former secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences told CNN. According to Rajeevan, even if the cloud seeding had succeeded, it was only a temporary fix, reducing pollution for a couple of days instead of tackling the root of the problem.</p><p>CNN has reached out to Delhi’s chief minister and environment minister for comment.</p><p>The scale of Delhi’s problem can be seen on the walls of the Red Fort, which takes its name from the red sandstone used to build the structure in the 1600s.</p><p>“Black crusts” are forming on the Red Fort’s 20-meter-high walls from “amorphous carbon and various heavy metals” found in the atmosphere, noted a study published earlier this year.</p><p>“Given the alarming air quality situation in Delhi, studying important monuments like the Red Fort is crucial for promoting effective conservation policies and interventions.” the study said.</p><p>“Of course, the fort has gone black,” said Raman, 64, who only gave one name, and has worked at the fort for four years.</p><p>“How will it not with the level of pollution in Delhi? There’s so much dust. After just a day of being outdoors, you go home and wash your face you see how much black stuff comes off.”</p><p>“I remember seeing the red fort on my first trip to Delhi about 30 years ago,” said Raman. “It definitely was much redder then. More like an apple color. Now that apple has rotten.”</p><p>A petition was filed in India’s top court earlier this month asking that air pollution be declared a “National Public Health Emergency,” and calling for the court to supervise a new anti-pollution strategy, so it’s carried out in a timely manner.</p><p>Filed on behalf of Luke Coutinho, a wellness expert who has spearheaded Modi’s Fit India movement, the petition accuses the government of failing to target the sources of industrial pollution and spending too little to curb vehicular emissions.</p><p>“Temporary measures such as mist sprayers, anti-smog guns, and artificial rain trials may provide symbolic reassurance but do little to mitigate emissions at the source,” the petition said.</p><p>Meanwhile reports attribute millions of deaths in the past three years to pollution in India.  The 2025 State of Global Air report estimated that in 2023, India accounted for nearly 30% of air pollution-related deaths worldwide.</p><p>“Our life expectancies are reduced by 5, 10 years, but the government is doing nothing about it,” said Prasad, the pediatrician, who said she sees three-year-olds at her clinic struggling with a “cough that never goes away.”</p><p>Prasad does not discount the importance of individual responsibility. “My neighbors had just had a baby and were burning crackers to celebrate. I wanted to go and tell them at least for the sake of your baby you should not be burning crackers at all,” she told CNN.</p><p>The India Gate protest did not last long; Protesters, including women and children, were detained for not having permission to demonstrate. Some said they were forced into police vehicles and were later released on the outskirts of Delhi. CNN has reached out to Delhi Police for comment.</p><p>As Delhi’s air pollution levels deteriorated from “very poor” to “severe” on last Tuesday, the government implemented increased pollution control measures as part of its Graded Response Action Plan.</p><p>Under this measure, schools up to Grade 5 operate in “hybrid” mode – with some classes online and others in-person. All non-essential construction is paused, and the most polluting vehicles are banned from the roads while the measure remains in force.</p><p>Protesters say they’ve sent multiple requests to meet Delhi’s chief minister, all of which have been denied. They say the government’s refusal to engage with them has brought them to the streets, and they’re not backing down.</p><p>“We’re here protesting because it’s our responsibility to speak up,” said Prasad, the doctor, at one of at least three protests held this month. “I hope the government listens.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Marine litter is a major environmental problem. Abandoned containers and fishing gear can trap or strangle animals, and plastic waste can break down into microplastics, which can release chemicals into the water that get into the food chain. Some research suggests that eating microplastic might even interfere with plankton’s ability to store carbon at the bottom of the ocean, which could impact climate change.</p><p>Between 1950 and 2020, 32 million metric tons of plastic accumulated in the ocean, according to one estimate — the weight of over 200,000 blue whales. Without any additional action, that figure is expected to reach 76 million tons by 2040.</p><p>A team of researchers and students is trying to change that — with an autonomous diving robot that can detect and retrieve litter from the seabed.</p><p>The Smart Grapple, developed at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), in Germany, uses an AI system to identify individual bits of trash using an onboard camera or, in murky water, sonar imaging.</p><p>It then grasps the object with its four-fingered hand — capable of lifting items up to around a meter (3 feet) long and wide, and weighing 250 kilograms (550 pounds) — and brings it to the surface. There, the waste is deposited on a small autonomous boat which takes it to the shore for recycling.</p><p>The diving robot is 115 centimeters (45 inches) high, with a diameter of 70 centimeters (28 inches), and weighs 120 kilograms (265 pounds).It’s connected to the boat by a cable which provides it with power, although it is also capable of moving underwater via its own thrusters.</p><p>Stefan Sosnowski, head of the research team at TUM, says the cable also aids the robot in bringing heavy items up to the surface.</p><p>“We can use the cable as basically the cable of a crane, and then the winch can pull up the system, which is more efficient than the little robot trying to swim things up,” he explains.</p><p>Once the Smart Grapple has identified the item of trash, it displays it in 3D to pinpoint precisely how to grasp it securely in its powerful hand. A complex set of sensors ensure it exerts enough force to hold onto the object without breaking it into smaller pieces.</p><p>Nicolas Hoischen, a doctoral student at TUM, who has worked on the Smart Grapple for two years, says “the most satisfying part” has been seeing the robot in action.</p><p>“Because of course then you’re projecting back two years ago, when you had a single arm, or maybe some small joint, and then you see the full grapple and it’s really breathtaking and amazing to see, in two years, how far we can go,” he says.</p><p>Hoischen was drawn to the project because he wanted to find a positive, real-world application for his research into robotic systems.</p><p>“It’s not just a fun project to work on here at the university… but also a project that might then also help ports, and countries in general… to get rid of this rubbish,” he says.</p><p>The TUM innovation is part of an EU-funded project, SeaClear 2.0, which aims to map and collect marine litter using a system of unmanned robots. Thirteen organizations across Europe, including universities and underwater technology companies, have contributed to the initiative.</p><p>SeaClear 2.0 project coordinator Bart De Schutter thinks automated robotic technology could be revolutionary in tackling marine litter. He says that currently, most underwater litter retrieval is done by human divers.</p><p>“They cannot do that 24/7, [and] there’s also a limited number of professional divers that can do it. So, with this solution we can extend the scope and reach of litter cleanup significantly,” he explains.</p><p>De Schutter expects SeaClear’s robots to be ready for widescale deployment between 2030 and 2033.</p><p>“It’s not the solution to all our problems with marine litter,” Sosnowski cautions, adding that we can’t simply continue to litter the oceans and rely on robots to pull it out.</p><p>“[But] in some specific areas, like harbors or natural reserves, where you might have a lot of ecological pressure on a specific area, I think there, robotic systems will definitely help,” he adds.</p><p>The Smart Grapple has been demonstrated at the Port of Marseille, in France, and the Port of Hamburg, in Germany, where it successfully retrieved a wide array of litter — from car seats to an intact cloth handkerchief.</p><p>“In part of our trials [the technology] is still also remotely controlled, simply because we’re still in the process of setting up the system and kind of figuring out all the kinks. But the functionality is such that we can also let it run completely autonomously,” says Sosnowski.</p><p>He explains that one of the most difficult challenges in developing the Smart Grapple was getting the system to correctly distinguish between waste and non-waste.</p><p>“What you have to do, really, is tell the system what is rubbish and what isn’t,” he says. To do this, the Smart Grapple was trained on images of underwater objects, labelled by TUM students as either litter or natural. “By that, [we] train the neural network to recognize what we want to collect,” he explains.</p><p>The robot was instructed on over 7,500 images. “It’s surprisingly few, but simply because there are no good underwater datasets available,” says Dr Sosnowski. “We created the largest one so far.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene’s shock announcement of her exit from the House of Representatives after a feud with Donald Trump shows the president still has power to punish challenges to his authority in the Republican Party.</p><p>But if his quest for total loyalty means Trump ignores the substance behind the complaints of the Georgia representative who was once one of his fiercest supporters, then he will lead his party down a risky road.</p><p>Greene on Sunday pushed back against reports that her departure from Congress in January is the precursor to a run for president in 2028, insisting in a lengthy post on X that she was “not motivated by power and titles.”</p><p>Given her apparent disgust with politics, her party and Washington in general, it might be wise to take her at her word. Still, her X post, along with a video and the long statement in which she made her announcement Friday, didn’t sound like someone who is leaving public debate or “America First” principles behind.</p><p>Whether Greene’s future lies in a conservative media role or in a political campaign, she took positions on Social Security, health care, immigration, foreign policy and the national debt that sound very much like a manifesto for a back-to-basics shift for the MAGA movement when Trump has left the scene.</p><p>Greene’s falling-out with Trump has created so much interest because it’s a fracture between two of MAGA’s top personalities, but also because it seems to hint at deeper rifts in the movement itself. And since she was once an enthusiastic player in the “toxic” politics pioneered by Trump and for which she apologized on CNN’s “State of the Union” last week, Greene’s turn may hint at a wider fatigue for the drama and bile that Trump whips up every day.</p><p>There are two theories circulating in Washington about Greene’s behavior.</p><p>► One is that the showdown and her exit prove that Trump’s iron grip on the party is as tight as ever. In this version, Greene will follow Trump critics like former Rep. Liz Cheney, former Sen. Jeff Flake and others who were effectively driven out of public office by the president’s attacks. By turning on Greene, the president demonstrated to every other GOP lawmaker what happens if they cross him.</p><p>Greene’s distaste for fighting a Trump-backed primary challenge, as expressed in her resignation announcement, will resonate among lawmakers who know the biggest threat to their jobs is losing in a GOP primary rather than in a general election after years of gerrymandering of congressional districts.</p><p>► An alternative possibility is that for Trump to become estranged from someone who was once as outspoken in his support as Greene, there must be genuine fissures in the party and the movement. The split has coincided with a slump in Trump’s national popularity a year after his reelection; suggestions that he’s becoming a lame duck; and an unprecedented revolt, in which Greene played a leading role, against Trump by the Capitol Hill GOP over the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p><p>There are likely elements of truth to both theories. It was never realistic that a lone member of Congress, even one as astute in cultivating publicity and controversy as Greene, would prevail in a political test of wills with a president — let alone one who transformed the GOP in his image, created his own populist movement and enjoys an exceptional bond with the grassroots of his party. But Greene argues that the president has departed from the values that took him into office and that validate his appeal. That’s a threat to Trump’s authority at a difficult political moment and a time when the power of second-term presidents often starts to ebb.</p><p>Making Greene’s life so intolerable that she’s driven out of Washington may represent an attempt by Trump to delay the waning of his political powers. But when revolutionaries start fighting over the meaning of the revolution, it’s usually a sign that their political project is in trouble.</p><p>Greene’s rebellion is not the only force tearing at GOP unity. A raging controversy over White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes has dragged in the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind much of Trump’s domestic program. There’s also growing criticism of Trump from the community of podcasters popular with young White men, which played an important role in his 2024 election triumph.</p><p>And Greene’s critique of Trump runs deeper than policy. She has complained about the impact of his cutting personal attacks on television and social media, warning that he has put her safety at risk, an experience that led her to reconsider her own past conduct. She accused Trump of dropping tens of millions of dollars against her in an attempt to “destroy” her politically. “It’s all so absurd and completely unserious. I refuse to be a ‘battered wife’ hoping it all goes away and gets better,” she wrote in her resignation statement.</p><p>Greene’s complaints about the impact of Trump’s attacks aren’t getting much sympathy from some of her Democratic adversaries. “I was like, ‘You have got to be kidding me,’” Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas told Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.</p><p>“You’re on the other side of the president for one week and you can’t take the heat. Imagine what it is to sit in my shoes, to not only be on the opposite side of him, but to have people like her who are constantly fanning the flames of hate,” Crockett said.</p><p>Greene’s immediate political prospects look unpromising — one reason her denials that she’s seeking a political reinvention in a new race may be taken at face value. Her prospects of a successful run in a party where she may be seen as disloyal to Trump seem remote, although the political ground could shift before the 2028 presidential primary race really cranks into gear.</p><p>The Georgia governor’s race is already crowded ahead of the Republican primary. A statewide race might in any case be challenging given the likelihood her extreme political past would alienate moderate swing voters, even if she’s reshaped her image in Washington.</p><p>Trump insisted that the root of Greene’s MAGA apostasy was thwarted ambition since he’d told her not to run for Georgia governor or US senator. She insisted that she had no designs on any other political positions. But she’d not be regarded a favorite for any step up in Georgia.</p><p>Still, by leaving Congress now, she can distance herself from the possible 2026 Republican loss of the House that she predicted when she resigned. And she’s positioned herself to be seen as one of the first Republicans to warn of impending disaster if a political postmortem begins.</p><p>Moreover, after Greene’s recent tensions with House Speaker Mike Johnson, her departure will make his life even more miserable, narrowing his tiny Republican majority.</p><p>Trump told ABC News on Friday that Greene’s resignation was “great news for the country.” But perhaps he shouldn’t celebrate too soon. Greene was, after all, part of the coalition that inflicted his most severe defeat by Capitol Hill Republicans, who backed a bill requiring the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — a step he had long resisted. Apart from the humiliation, the new law he signed last week worsened his political headache on the issue.</p><p>And Greene, channeling the views of voters in a district that she won with a huge majority last year, has forensically criticized Trump. She’s warned that the administration is gaslighting Americans over prices and accused the Republican Party of doing nothing to alleviate the plight of Affordable Care Act policyholders who are seeing the cost of premiums double in some cases. And she’s criticized Trump’s search for a foreign policy legacy as antithetical to the principles of the “America First” movement, which  prioritizes domestic concerns.</p><p>The health care struggle is sharpening this fundamental tension in the GOP</p><p>If Republican voters broadly share her concerns — which are mirrored across a far wider political spectrum than the MAGA movement, according to polls — enthusiasm for party candidates could dip to dangerous levels in the midterm elections.</p><p>Trump’s attempts to address the affordability crisis have been lamentable: He’s claimed that Americans struggling with the cost of living are living in an economic golden age. It’s not hard to see that Greene is far more attuned to the reality of much of the country than Trump, a billionaire who lives a gilded lifestyle and surrounds himself with wealthy acolytes and sycophantic officials.</p><p>There’s also something deeper to Greene’s recent comments. She diagnosed a political system that is failing millions of Americans. She argued the country’s leaders are negligent in assessing Americans’ most basic needs: on health care, feeding their kids, financing college and offering a viable future in which they can bring up their own young families.</p><p>Whether or not she runs for president in 2028, Greene has already hit upon the likely theme of the next race. And it’s one that resonates far beyond the MAGA movement.</p><p>Greene came to Washington after winning election for the first time in 2020 as a firebrand purveyor of absurd conspiracy theories and a proponent of the QAnon movement. She once regarded Trump as the greatest president of her lifetime.</p><p>Her departure less than a year into Trump’s second term is damning commentary on his presidency.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Seven years ago, they were part of a wave of first-time candidates who helped Democrats retake the US House. But their tenures in Congress were brief.</p><p>Ben McAdams of Utah lost his first re-election bid in 2020. Two years later, Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Elaine Luria of Virginia were defeated by Republican opponents as the GOP retook control of the House.</p><p>Now, the former lawmakers are launching comebacks, running on both affordability issues and the public service and democracy-focused messaging that helped them during the first Trump administration.</p><p>“There’s a lot of dissatisfaction across the country,” Luria said in an interview. “This administration, these current incumbent members of Congress made lots of promises to the country, to their constituents, and they’ve gone to Washington and done none of it.”</p><p>In many ways, the stakes of the 2026 midterms mimic those of 2018, when Democrats flipped 40 US House seats during President Donald Trump’s first term with candidates who emphasized their national security and public service backgrounds. In office, many of those winning candidates valued bipartisanship even when it meant bucking their own party.</p><p>But the political landscape they’re competing in will look very different. The number of competitive seats has dwindled, fueled in part by a nationwide mid-cycle redistricting push launched at Trump’s behest. And the party’s base is increasingly seeking candidates willing to push back on the administration, not work across the aisle.</p><p>“This cycle, it’s about who’s going to stand up and fight for our values against the Trump administration, as it runs a roughshod over them,” said Ian Russell, a Democratic strategist advising state Sen. Kathleen Riebe, a McAdams opponent. “That’s less of an ideological discussion and more of a presentation discussion.”</p><p>Malinowski, a former State Department official who defeated a four-term Republican incumbent, is competing in a crowded primary for the safe Democratic seat Mikie Sherrill is vacating after winning the New Jersey governor race. McAdams, who ousted former GOP Rep. Mia Love by about 700 votes in 2018, is running in a new, heavily Democratic seat drawn by court order.</p><p>Luria is seeking a rematch against Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans, who beat her in 2022. While that race is currently viewed as a toss-up, it could become more favorable if Virginia Democrats succeed in their redistricting effort.</p><p>“Out of touch Democrats Ben McAdams, Tom Malinowski, and Elaine Luria are about to be members of the Repeat Losers Club,” Mike Marinella, a spokesman for House Republicans’ campaign arm, said in a statement.</p><p>The trio’s comeback bids come as Democrats are hoping to build on the electoral wins this month in Virginia, New Jersey and California. While making the cost of living a centerpiece of their messaging, Democrats are once again arguing that Trump poses a threat to democracy and that retaking the House is the best way to check his power.</p><p>“It’s a more acute version of the same threat that led a bunch of folks who had never run for office before to decide that running for the House of Representatives was the most useful thing that we could do about the danger facing the country,” Malinowski told CNN.</p><p>Part of Democrats’ success in 2018 came from backing candidates who were moderate enough to win swing districts. Many of those lawmakers have become the bench of the party, winning gubernatorial and Senate races.</p><p>This time around, the comeback candidates will have to show they’re the right candidate in blue, not purple, districts. None of the former lawmakers have been able to clear out their primary fields, and they will need to advance through competitive primaries.</p><p>In New Jersey, Malinowski won the endorsement of Sen. Andy Kim, while Gov. Phil Murphy endorsed another candidate in the race. (Malinowski previously backed Kim during his Senate campaign against Murphy’s wife, Tammy.)</p><p>Several Democrats are expected to run for the nomination in Utah. And while one candidate dropped out of the Virginia race and backed Luria, Navy reservist James Osyf issued a defiant statement ahead of her campaign launch.</p><p>“Yesterday’s establishment got us into this mess; they’re not going to get us out of it,” said Osyf, who launched his campaign in July. “This moment demands new leaders who know democracy is at a breaking point and are ready to fight for it – regardless of which way the political winds are blowing.”</p><p>Luria’s former Hampton Roads district is competitive under the current district lines. But her announcement last week came after Virginia lawmakers began the process of putting a proposal on the ballot next year that would allow them to redraw the state’s congressional map in Democrats’ favor. Though no maps have been released, the seat is expected to become much more favorable for Democrats.</p><p>Luria said the potential redistricting didn’t influence her decision. She said she passed on the 2024 campaign after a difficult period for her family but feels compelled to enter the race this cycle.</p><p>“I’m running for the second district as it exists today, and if those lines change between here and Election Day, we’ll adjust,” she said.</p><p>Luria has already changed one position that dogged her time in office: her opposition to banning congressional stock trading. When she was previously in Congress, Luria called the concept of a ban “bullsh*t.” She said this week that her position has “evolved over time,” and she would now support the current proposal to ban stock trading for members of Congress.</p><p>“I can see, and I appreciate a lot more now, the absolute distrust that people have in current members of Congress and the government,” she told CNN. “I think this is a small gesture for members of Congress to do to at least make people feel that they can trust in them that they’re not going to use their office for any sort of personal gain.”</p><p>McAdams, meanwhile, has changed his stance on abortion. While in office, he said he supported the teachings of his LDS faith “that oppose abortion except in cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother’s life and in certain other rare circumstances” as well as the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion in most cases. At the same time, he said that “decisions about terminating a pregnancy should made by a woman in consultation with her physician and others whose counsel she trusts.”</p><p>He told CNN last week that he would support codifying the protections in Roe v. Wade, which allowed for abortion until fetal viability, due to how much upheaval the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the ruling has called. His campaign said he also no longer supports the Hyde Amendment.</p><p>The question is whether his ties to the district – he spent years representing parts of the district as a mayor and state senator – are enough to win a seat that’s now solidly blue.</p><p>“My style of governing doesn’t change based on the politics of where I’m running,” McAdams said.</p><p>All three candidates are banking that there’s still room in the party for moderates, even in districts that can afford to elect more progressive candidates.</p><p>“That’s what we’re missing today,” said John Lapp, a former executive director of House Democrats’ campaign arm when the party won control in 2006. “Folks willing to take on the system, but also people willing to solve problems instead of just shutting things down and having tantrums.”</p><p>Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify Ben McAdams’ past stance on abortion rights.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump is planning to unveil a new proposal for addressing health care costs as soon as Monday, as his administration tries to avert a spike in premiums driven by the expiration of key Affordable Care Act subsidies, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.</p><p>The plan aims to fulfill Trump’s vow to deliver a better alternative to the enhanced ACA subsidies relied on by nearly 22 million people and comes after Democrats rejected measures to reopen the shuttered government for more than a month over their demand for a clean extension of those payments.</p><p>Senate Republicans agreed to hold a mid-December vote on extending the enhanced subsidies, which are set to lapse at year’s end, in exchange for extending government funding through January, spurring the effort by Trump and his aides to develop their own competing proposal. The beefed-up assistance was originally passed in 2021 as part of a Biden administration Covid-19 relief package.</p><p>If the subsidies expire, the premiums people pay are expected to more than double next year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Plus, an estimated 2 million more people will be uninsured next year, the Congressional Budget Office found.</p><p>Democrats are already planning to use that predicted fallout against the GOP in next year’s midterm elections, hoping it will prove as effective as it did in the 2018 midterms, when Republicans lost control of the House in part because of their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act the year before.</p><p>The administration’s proposal is not final, and the timing and content could still change, the people familiar with the matter said. In a statement, a White House official said that “until President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the Administration’s healthcare positions is mere speculation.”</p><p>Obamacare enrollees: Worried about losing the enhanced subsidies? Share your story</p><p>MS NOW first reported Trump’s plan to announce his proposal as early as Monday.</p><p>But the framework under discussion envisions temporarily extending the ACA subsidies in some form, while incorporating a series of guardrails aimed at limiting their scope — potentially including new income limits and a requirement that all enrollees pay some form of premium.</p><p>Those provisions would address two of the main critiques that Republicans have about the enhanced subsidies, including that so-called zero premium plans drive fraudulent behavior. But it would also set up the ACA for a more fundamental overhaul down the road along the lines of what Trump has been demanding in recent weeks.</p><p>Republicans have wanted to restore an income cap to the premium subsidies, which had been 400% of the federal poverty level before the enhancement took effect in 2021. The elimination of that cap made Obamacare plans more affordable for the middle class, who will be among the hardest hit if the beefed-up subsidies lapse at year’s end.</p><p>At the other end of the income scale, the proposal would mandate that everyone pay at least some monthly premium, which is aimed at addressing a wave of fraud spawned by another provision of the enhancement that allowed many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no premiums. Brokers and agents sought to earn commissions by enrolling people in Obamacare policies or switching them to new ones without their knowledge or consent. Requiring that lower-income enrollees pay at least some premium would be aimed at reducing the incentives and opportunities for brokers and agents to commit such actions.</p><p>The proposal is also likely to include an option for certain enrollees who choose a lower-tier insurance plan on the exchanges to redirect some federal aid into a health savings account, the people familiar said. Trump in recent weeks has repeatedly called for a plan that would divert federal funding directly to individuals to help them purchase coverage, rather sending the money to insurance companies as part of the subsidy program.</p><p>Answering Trump’s call, GOP Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have rolled out proposals to allow consumers to take at least part of their federal subsidies and put the assistance in health savings accounts. Scott’s plan calls for enabling enrollees to use all the aid to buy coverage, including potentially less comprehensive and less expensive plans outside the ACA. Such a provision could greatly undermine Obamacare’s health.</p><p>Cassidy, on the other hand, wants to shift just the enhanced subsidies to HSAs and allow enrollees to use the funds to pay for health care services, such as doctors visits, prescriptions and glasses.</p><p>Meanwhile, a plan pushed by the influential Paragon Health Institute would enable lower-income enrollees to put another set of subsidies that reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses into HSAs to give them more control. Plus, it calls for Congress to once again fund these cost-sharing subsidies, which would lower certain Obamacare plans’ premiums.</p><p>Several other popular conservative policy ideas could also make it into the framework, such as provisions designed to expand the availability of non-ACA health plans, the people said.</p><p>Trump is separately expected to call on Congress to codify into law a “Most Favored Nation” drug policy. He has relied on the initiative to strike a range of voluntary deals with pharmaceutical companies aimed at lowering drug costs in the US by tying their prices to lower ones paid in peer countries.</p><p>This story has been updated with additional information.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Test your eye for visual effects. What’s real and what’s not might surprise you.</p><p>In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.</p><p>But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.</p><p>“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”</p><p>Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.</p><p>To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>2. Production</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.</p><p>“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.</p><p>Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.</p><p>“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”</p><p>Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.</p><p>But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)</p><p>Take a look below at how “Severance” planned out its Season 2 opening using rough 3D models.</p><p>An animatic, or basic animation with simple, undetailed 3D models, helped the “Severance” crew plan the exact cadence, camera angles and more.</p><p></p><p>In this first shot, a Bolt motion camera uses a robotic arm for rapid back-and-forth shots.</p><p>Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-</p><p>generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.</p><p>The visual effects team also coordinates with other departments to ensure production goes smoothly.</p><p>“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.</p><p>The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”</p><p>Case in point: “Wicked” used exclusively blue screens because of how prominent green in the story, including Elphaba’s skin, the Emerald City and guard uniforms. And certain scenes required a scale that was unrealistic to build. So instead, production design built interior sets up to 25 feet and exterior sets up to 55 feet. Visual effects took care of the rest.</p><p>“Filmmaking is one of the those disciplines where everything is done through collaborating with each other,” said Helman. “There are about 1,000 people just on visual effects” for the “Wicked” films, he said. He added, “We all put a little bit into the creative process so that the movie has texture and has layers.”</p><p>2. Production</p><p>Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>Shooting begins on the project.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.</p><p>“Maybe it was this perfect shot of the sunset, and my two leads were finally getting together. And a car drove by in the background that no one knew about,” said ILM’s Eric Leven, the visual effects supervisor for Season 2 of “Severance.”</p><p>Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.</p><p>That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.</p><p>Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.</p><p>Early, simple 3D models can also help directors and actors in the shooting process. James Cameron’s Avatar films, which feature the blue alien species called Na’vi, heavily relied on a depth compositing tool that rendered those aliens, CGI objects and environments in real time on the camera screen as filming took place.</p><p>“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”</p><p>The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.</p><p>This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.</p><p>“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.</p><p>The “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage. This allows James Cameron to walk through an empty set but see things as if he were filming in</p><p>real time.</p><p>How the “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

Marketing and trailers start in earnest at this stage.</p><p>Once shooting wraps, the postproduction phase begins and the team puts together the final product.</p><p>“[“Jurassic World Rebirth” director] Gareth Edwards said that prep and shoot is where you go shopping for your meal, and post is where you actually get to cook it,” said Vickery.</p><p>The visual effects team works in close conjunction with the director and editor throughout this phase. Artists will create rough drafts of the visual effects with the real footage for the director’s approval and feedback. The editor will incorporate the evolving VFX shots into the main edit. As the shots come together, the director can see the overall flow of the film and slowly, the picture comes alive.</p><p>“In visual effects, everything happens in layers,” said Helman. “There could be 30, 40 people working on one shot at the same time.”</p><p>The number of visual effects shots can rack up quickly. “Jurassic World Rebirth” had about 1,500 VFX shots; “Wicked: For Good” had about 2,000 and “Avatar: The Way of Water” had over 3,200. Comparatively, a 2010 study found that the average number of total shots per movie (including non-VFX and VFX) was about 1,100.</p><p>But Helman emphasizes that regardless of how many shots there are, the end goal is to make a cohesive story. “It always goes back to sitting around a fire with a bunch of people at night, listening to somebody telling a story. You’re just changing the tools a little bit. And that’s all we are. We are a tool to tell a story,” Helman said.</p><p>Leven estimates a single visual effect shot passes through four to six people and takes three to six weeks to complete. For Severance’s Season 2 hallway run, the  total — including previs and postvis teams and people on set —  involved about 20 to 25 people for the two-minute scene.</p><p>A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual one in a CG world.</p><p>Environmental specialists build the CG world.

Maybe the edges of moving hair don’t quite have the right amount of blur. Maybe a door looks too narrow. The “Wicked” team, for example, paid particular attention to the animals so they could get across emotional nuances despite limited facial expressions.</p><p>And if that weren’t enough, the marketing team starts its job well in advance of the finish line. “It’s like releasing an ad campaign out before the product’s ready,” said Vickery. Audience screenings often happen midway through post production, and trailers are needed before the film is finished. “They’re definitely things that make for a lot of hard work from the visual effects department.”</p><p>This year’s “Superman,” for example, released a trailer that got some people up in arms over a oddly edited shot of Superman flying. Fans claimed there was “bad CGI” on actor David Corenswet’s face, but director James Gunn later said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was just an unfinished VFX composite shot that’s “not even the shot that’s in the movie.”</p><p>At the end of the day, even the best visual effects team can be undercut by unreasonable expectations and timelines. And for the artists, it can be frustrating when only the worst of their work gets noticed.</p><p>“What [the audience has] to understand is that visual effects artists are incredibly passionate artists who put a lot of love and care and attention into what they do. … [You] don’t see 90 percent of the visual effects work that they do. [You] only notice the 10 or 5 percent that’s not perfectly executed,” said Vickery.</p><p>Leven also echoed similar sentiments and explained poor work is rarely because of a lack of talent or technology.</p><p>“Usually the effects artists working on it don’t have enough time.

{"details":"<p>On a chilly Saturday night, Morgan Geyser left the group home where she was living in Madison, Wisconsin, and met up with an acquaintance on a quiet residential street nearby.</p><p>Before she vanished, police say the 23-year-old cut off the monitoring bracelet law enforcement used to track her whereabouts, years after she pleaded guilty to attempted murder in the “Slender Man” stabbing of her 12-year-old classmate.</p><p>Payton Leutner was stabbed at Waukesha park in 2014 by Geyser and her friend Anissa Weier, who were also 12 at the time. The girls told investigators the attack was meant to impress the fictitious boogeyman.</p><p>Late Sunday, Madison police said they received confirmation that Geyser was taken into custody in Illinois, more than a hundred miles away.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the search for Geyser and the internet-created boogeyman that prompted an attack that shocked the nation more than a decade ago.</p><p>Slender Man, a menacing, faceless man in a dark suit – sometimes portrayed with octopus-like tentacles – was a crowdsourced internet-created boogeyman that first appeared in an online forum in 2009, according to Shira Chess, an associate professor of entertainment and media studies at the University of Georgia and and co-author of the book “Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man.”</p><p>“He falls broadly into a category of fiction that is colloquially referred to as ‘creepypasta,’ or internet legends that have meme-like qualities, typically lack known authorship, and are easily spreadable,” Chess told CNN in an email Sunday.</p><p>In June 2009, a Photoshop contest for images that appeared to be paranormal was launched in a forum on the website Something Awful. According to Know Your Meme, a blog that chronicles web culture, the goal of the contest was to create the images and then use them to fool, or “troll,” other web users by submitting them to paranormal websites.</p><p>Site member Eric Knudsen (under the screen name “Victor Surge”) submitted two images to the contest, both black-and-white images of children, one of which appeared to show a largely undefined figure lurking in the background.</p><p>Many imaginative fans saw Slender Man’s facelessness as a blank canvas in which to reimagine him in any number of ways, Chess added.</p><p>Following the stabbing, Geyser and Weier told police they knew the character from the Creepypasta Wiki, a site that compiles such fiction. The site has issued a statement condemning the attack.</p><p>Slender Man’s popularity has gone down in recent years, according to Chess, who noted the fandom peaked in the early-to-mid 2010s.</p><p>“I can anecdotally say that he still performs the role of boogeyman on playgrounds,” Chess told CNN.</p><p>In May 2014, the trio had gone to Geyser’s home for a slumber party to celebrate her birthday, Leutner previously told ABC. During those times, Geyser constantly talked about Slender Man, she added.</p><p>“I thought it was odd. It kind of frightened me a little bit,” Leutner said of her friends’ fascination with the character. “But I went along with it. I was supportive because I thought that’s what she liked.”</p><p>As the friendship between Geyser and Weier grew, so did the pair’s fixation with Slender Man, Leutner said. While Leutner didn’t know her friends planned to harm her, something felt off that night in retrospect, she said.</p><p>“At all of our past sleepovers, (Geyser) always wanted to stay up all night because she could never do that at home,” Leutner said. “But on (the night of) the birthday party, she wanted to go to bed.”</p><p>Her friends later told investigators they had planned to kill Leutner in her sleep that night but then decided to do it the next morning at a nearby park.</p><p>When she woke up, they were downstairs on the computer so she joined them for doughnuts before heading to the park. While there, they told her the plan was to play hide-and-seek and asked her to lie down under the leaves and sticks as part of the game, she said.</p><p>That is when Geyser repeatedly stabbed her with a kitchen knife and the girls left her alone in the woods, bleeding and struggling to get help. After she crawled out of the woods, a passing bicyclist found her and called 911.</p><p>Authorities said Sunday they were searching for Geyser, who was last seen in a residential neighborhood on the west side of Madison, Wisconsin, around 8 p.m. Saturday with an adult acquaintance, police said in a statement.</p><p>Police later said in an update that they received confirmation around 10:34 p.m. that Geyser had been taken into custody in Illinois.</p><p>Geyser was found sleeping at a truck stop in Posen, Illinois, around 150 miles from Madison, Posen police told CNN. She was with another person, whom police did not identify, and the two were taken into custody, police said.</p><p>Geyser’s attorney, Tony Cotton, had earlier urged the 23-year-old to turn herself in immediately, saying in a statement: “We worked too hard to secure her freedom for her to continue on this path.”</p><p>It is unclear how Geyser broke out of the group home or who helped her, Cotton said in a video posted to social media.</p><p>At age 15, Geyser pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted first-degree murder in a deal with prosecutors to be placed in a mental institution instead of serving jail time.</p><p>Weier pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree homicide due to mental illness or defect as part of a plea agreement. She was committed to 25 years in a mental hospital, The Associated Press reported, but was released in 2021 on condition she live with her father and wear a GPS monitor.</p><p>At her sentencing in 2018, Geyser apologized to Leutner and her family.“I never meant this to happen,” a tearful Geyser said. “I hope that she is doing well.”</p><p>In January, a judge ordered Geyser could be released from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute, where she spent nearly seven years, the Associated Press reported.</p><p>In August, a facility in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, declined to take her due to negative publicity they were receiving about the potential move, according to CNN affiliate WMTV, but Madison police confirmed with the news station Geyser is currently living at a group home in Madison, on the same street where she was last seen.</p><p>This story has been updated.</p><p>CNN’s Chris Boyette, Dakin Andone, Doug Gross, Faith Karimi, Alex Stambaugh and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The Israeli military says it killed Hezbollah’s second most senior figure in the first air strikes in months on southern Beirut.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) called Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah’s Chief of Staff, “a key operative and veteran in the terrorist organization.”</p><p>“The strike was intended to prevent the organization from further strengthening its capabilities and to deliver a precise blow to those who attempt to harm the State of Israel,” said IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir in a statement after the attack.</p><p>Hezbollah said the killing of Tabatabai was “a treacherous Israeli attack” on the Haret Hreik neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs, according to a statement Sunday.</p><p>Five people were killed and 28 injured in the attack, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.</p><p>Images from the scene showed smoke coming from the fourth or fifth floor of an apartment building in a crowded part of southern Beirut.</p><p>The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF had struck “in the heart of Beirut, targeting Hezbollah’s Chief of Staff, who led the organization’s buildup and armament efforts.”</p><p>Netanyahu ordered the strike based on the recommendation of the Minister of Defense and the IDF Chief of Staff, his office said.</p><p>“We will continue to act forcefully to prevent any threat to the residents of the north and to the State of Israel,” said Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, adding: “Anyone who raises a hand against Israel — his hand will be cut off.”</p><p>Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said in a post to social media Sunday that Israel’s targeting of Beirut is “proof that it does not heed the repeated calls to stop its aggressions against Lebanon.” He also called on the international community to “intervene forcefully.”</p><p>The last strikes the IDF acknowledged carrying out in the Lebanese capital of Beirut occurred in early-June, when Israel said it targeted underground drone production facilities belonging to Hezbollah. Since then, Israel has refrained from striking Beirut, even as it has carried out frequent attacks in southern Lebanon, considered a Hezbollah stronghold.</p><p>An Israeli strike on southern Beirut in September 2024 killed Hezbollah’s long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah, and Israeli strikes have hollowed out the group’s military leadership.

{"details":"<p>Markets</p><p>Hot Stocks</p><p>Fear & Greed Index</p><p>Latest Market News</p><p>Hot Stocks</p><p>Nakul Mishra is already thinking about refinancing – even before he closes on his first home.</p><p>The 34-year-old had spent two years searching for the right home in Sacramento to settle into with his family. He finally found one he could afford, but not without some risk.</p><p>This month, Mishra opted to take out a seven-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), betting he’ll score a lower rate before the fixed period expires. It’s a calculation more buyers are making lately as ARMs – the mortgage products that helped fuel housing market risk in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis – regain popularity.</p><p>An ARM loan offers Mishra something fixed-rate mortgages can’t: short-term breathing room from high borrowing costs. But they come with a risk. After a fixed introductory period, usually five, seven or 10 years, an ARM’s rate resets with the market. If rates rise, monthly payments can surge.</p><p>Still, the number of Americans turning to these riskier loans has climbed sharply. The share of homebuyers using ARM loans has more than tripled over the past five years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. In one week this September, ARMs accounted for their largest share — 12.9% — of total mortgage applications since 2008.</p><p>The uptick in ARMs comes as America’s housing affordability crisis remains far from resolved. National home prices continue to climb, and mortgage rates have hovered between 6% and 7% for years. While the Trump administration has pledged to tackle affordability — including a proposal for a 50-year mortgage — limited options for reducing monthly payments are pushing more homebuyers toward loans that offer immediate relief, even if they introduce more uncertainty down the road.</p><p>After his seven-year introductory period ends, Mishra’s loan can increase by a maximum of two percentage points the first time it adjusts. Eventually, though, it can climb up to five percentage points higher, meaning his mortgage rate could reach 10.5%.</p><p>“The interest rate after the seven-year period can be scary,” he said. “We don’t want to get into that territory.”</p><p>Some experts say today’s ARMs include safeguards that make a 2008-style meltdown less likely. Even so, they warn that buyers should tread carefully with these variable-rate loans.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know.</p><p>The renewed interest in ARMs is partly driven by buyers betting that mortgage rates will fall from current levels, said Andrew Marquis, a senior vice president at CrossCountry Mortgage, a lender in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p><p>After raising interest rates at the fastest pace in more than 40 years to fight surging inflation in 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve has now reversed course, cutting its benchmark rate three times last year and twice so far this year. Many economists expect the Fed to cut rates further in the coming year.</p><p>The Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates, but its moves can influence them by pushing the 10-year US Treasury yield up or down.</p><p>Right now, there’s a mix of people considering ARM loans, Marquis said.</p><p>“It could be that they are only going to be in their house for five to seven years and might move,” he said. “There are also people who think rates are going to go lower and they’ll refinance.”</p><p>Mishra falls into the second camp. He chose a 7/6 ARM at 5.5%, meaning the introductory period lasts for seven years, after which the rate resets every six months. That introductory rate is well below the average 30-year fixed rate, which was 6.24% last week, according to Freddie Mac.</p><p>Mishra said he shopped around to at least five or six lenders to get the most competitive mortgage rate.</p><p>Mishra said he thinks the next two to three years will likely bring lower mortgage rates.</p><p>“The worst-case scenario is that rates don’t go lower and we have to get through the seven years,” he said. “But at that point, we will still be saving $200 to $300 a month. That will add up.”</p><p>While ARM loans can lead to short-term savings, there is a risk that your rate will reset when interest rates are higher.</p><p>Such was the case in 2008, when loans played a key role in the subprime mortgage crisis. Looser underwriting standards meant ARMs were offered to borrowers with poor credit who often couldn’t afford their monthly mortgage payments after the fixed-rate period expired.</p><p>The total number of ARM loans is up significantly from a record low in 2022. However, it’s still a fraction of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s, according to data from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a financial services company.</p><p>In September of this year, there were about 3 million total adjustable-rate home loans, representing 5.4% all US loans, according to ICE. Compare that to September 2008, when ARMs made up 26% of all loans.</p><p>Today, documentation standards are much stricter, said Martin Seay, a professor of personal financial planning at Kansas State University.</p><p>Lenders are now required to assess whether a borrower can afford the loan at a higher, adjusted rate, not just the lower introductory rate. New rules also cap how much the interest rate can rise or fall during adjustment periods.</p><p>And ARMs today carry longer initial fixed periods than their predecessors. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, payments were often fixed for an initial period of just one to three years, according to the Urban Institute.</p><p>Among the nearly 2 million ARM loans that have been originated since 2020 and are still active, 80% have initial fixed periods of at least five years, and two-thirds are fixed for at least seven years, according to ICE.</p><p>But taking out an ARM loan over a fixed-rate loan has some risk, Seay said.</p><p>“People have to understand the cleanest way to use an adjustable-rate mortgage is if you know you’re not going to stay somewhere for more than five to seven years, whatever that initial term is,” he said. “Past that, you’re making a bet.”</p><p>“An economist can’t tell you what is going to happen with interest rates in seven years, so I can’t imagine the average person is going to be able to accurately predict it,” he added.</p><p>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Bowser stand to collect millions of dollars more than housing experts say is normal for an affordable housing project.</p><p>A short drive from the soon-to-be redeveloped RFK Stadium site in Southeast Washington, a red-brick building known as the Ethel has been lauded by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) as the kind of development needed to solve an affordable housing crisis in one of the most expensive regions in the country.</p><p>All 100 one-bedroom units come with social services for the formerly homeless people who live there, mostly rent-free — a response to the intense needs in a city where tent encampments have been common.</p><p>But it’s not only residents who have benefited.</p><p>The building’s developers are collecting millions of dollars more than housing finance experts say would normally go to developers for such a project — money flowing from a cascade of government subsidies approved by city officials, a Washington Post investigation found.</p><p>The Post’s findings show that, thanks to the near-free land and tens of millions of dollars in other subsidies, the developers stand to collect more than $13 million in payouts during the building’s first 15 years of operation if their projections hold. The payments come on top of an $8.5 million developer fee, also funded through subsidies, that experts say should alone have compensated them for undertaking the project.</p><p>“Bluntly, the taxpayers of D.C. are being screwed by this,” said Kirk McClure, a professor emeritus for the public affairs school at the University of Kansas and a former loan underwriter for the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. He and two other experts who reviewed the financial records at The Post’s request questioned whether the District has adequate guardrails to prevent overpaying developers.</p><p>The partnership responsible for developing the Ethel is led by Chris Donatelli, CEO of a Bethesda-based real estate development company, and Bryan “Scottie” Irving, founder of D.C.-based Blue Skye Development. Both men are longtime Bowser campaign supporters, and both have repeatedly been among developers who received free or heavily discounted land from the District in return for promises to build affordable housing.</p><p>Bowser appointed Irving to the board of the D.C. Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA), a local government entity responsible for ensuring that such projects do not receive more funding than they need and that developers are not overcompensated.</p><p>Nina Albert, who began as deputy mayor for planning and economic development two years after the Ethel was financed, said that she and her staff put “fresh eyes” on the deal after questions from The Post and that they determined “unequivocally that the developer was not unduly enriched.” She maintained that the project came “at no cost to taxpayers” and “did not include any D.C. money.” Records show the development budget relied on a city loan to be repaid through tens of millions of dollars in revenue from the locally funded rental vouchers, the near-free land and $27 million in forgone federal tax revenue to provide low-income housing tax credits.</p><p>Albert said in a statement that the Ethel is “a crucial lifeline to at-risk families, offering community services and amenities to teach residents life skills, helping them reenter the workforce, or otherwise putting them on a path to long-term growth and stability.”</p><p>Donatelli did not respond to requests for comment. His attorney, Paul E. Alpuche, declined to comment. Irving also declined to comment.</p><p>After the Ethel was financed, the mayor’s office tapped Donatelli and Irving to develop five more city-owned parcels in Hill East, though a recent court order has called into question whether Donatelli will remain involved. The area is ripe for investment after the D.C. Council approved a $3.7 billion deal for a new Washington Commanders stadium complex.</p><p>When Bowser first ran for mayor in 2014, Donatelli and Irving were part of the “Green Team” of civic leaders and donors who backed her. The pair, their families and companies controlled by them combined to contribute about $25,000 to the campaign. Donatelli celebrated at Bowser’s primary election party, wearing a green “MURIEL FOR MAYOR” T-shirt.</p><p>iClick these iconsto see documents and more detailed information.</p><p>City officials had long envisioned buildings on the land as a beachhead for further redevelopment in Hill East, an area of modest houses between the Capitol Hill neighborhood and the Anacostia River that has long been home to public facilities, including the now-demolished D.C.

That allowed the Ethel to qualify for the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.</p><p>Then the city added another subsidy to the Ethel, pledging 20 years of locally funded rental vouchers for each of the building’s 100 units. The tenants put 30 percent of their income toward rent, but that contribution is from a few hundred dollars to nothing for most, leaving the city to pay the bulk. The District agreed to allow the building to collect $2,648 per month for each unit — several hundred dollars above the market rate, according to an appraisal report.</p><p>The project had gone from cash-poor — as most affordable housing developments are — to bursting with subsidies.</p><p>The land contribution also gave the developers a parcel on which they have built a second apartment building, the Park Kennedy, which carries a far lower affordable housing burden — only 31 of 262 units. The parcel of land, not including the building that sits on it, is assessed on the tax rolls at $9.8 million.</p><p>The Ethel’s financial plan began coming together in early 2021. So did a highly unusual part of the deal, according to records The Post obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.</p><p>The land sale and accompanying loan were authorized by John Falcicchio, the mayor’s then chief of staff and then deputy mayor for planning and economic development. Ben Soto, Bowser’s former longtime campaign treasurer, served as trustee for the loan through Premium Title & Escrow, a company he runs that handled the development’s financial closing.</p><p>Soto said in a phone message that the Ethel’s financing appeared ordinary, and that it is common for someone who handles a closing to serve as trustee for a related loan. Falcicchio did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>In August 2021, the project’s financing went before DCHFA’s board. Irving did not attend the meeting. The other members signed off unanimously.</p><p>A sale of such land as part of a complex transaction involving federal tax credits is not in itself unusual, the three experts who reviewed the deal told The Post. But a setup under which payments for land essentially gifted by the government go to for-profit developers — on top of a large developer fee — is unheard of, the experts said. A Post review of dozens of tax-credit projects in the District found no other similar case. What’s more common is a local government being repaid for donated land if a project does well financially.</p><p>Michael Diamond, a Georgetown University law professor who focuses on housing and economic development, said there’s a key unanswered question in the transaction: What did the developers do to earn the $7.1 million in payments?</p><p>“If the answer is nothing, then you have a siphoning situation,” he said, meaning an inappropriate benefit.</p><p>The mayor’s office offered several explanations for the land transaction. It said the arrangement allowed the project to qualify for a larger mortgage, reduced tax liabilities and rewarded the developers for readying the land for development. The experts who reviewed the deal at The Post’s request said none of those explanations resolved their questions.</p><p>But Albert acknowledged that the project budget reimbursed the developers for their expenses during the pre-construction phase.</p><p>McClure, the University of Kansas professor, said the developer fee alone should have compensated for the risk of fronting those expenses. “If the land rose in value, then God bless the taxpayers of the District of Columbia — they should have enjoyed that increase in value,” he said. “That [the developer] puts some money up front, that’s why he gets $8 million in developers fees. We expect him to have to put millions of dollars into this deal.”</p><p>Christopher Donald, DCHFA’s executive director, and his staffers worked with Donatelli to iron out the Ethel’s financial details, records show.</p><p>Budgets the city relied on ahead of the Ethel’s construction indicated the higher amount was not needed, and federal law specifies that a project cannot collect more tax credits than necessary for its financial feasibility — a determination DCHFA is required to make.</p><p>Two weeks later, as the project’s financial closing drew near, a representative of Donatelli sent DCHFA updated budgets that again showed the project fully funded without the higher amount. Still, Donald signed a document supporting the boosted figure, saying it was necessary to ensure “the financial feasibility of the Project.”</p><p>After the building opened in 2023, when Donatelli claimed the higher figure, it generated an extra $5.2 million in cash for the development from PNC Bank, records show, though the project’s cost had barely changed.</p><p>Donald declined to be interviewed. DCHFA’s spokeswoman, Yolanda McCutchen, did not answer questions about why the agency agreed to the higher tax credit figure, saying in an email that it “was allowable in accordance with federal regulations.” She said Donald’s memo to the board “contained a clerical error,” which was corrected in the second document he signed. She did not say why the budgets that Donatelli’s representative circulated just ahead of the project’s financial closing also indicated the development was fully funded without the tax-credit boost.</p><p>The higher amount “requires an explanation,” said William Pavão, a former executive director of the California agency that administers federal low-income housing tax credits for that state. “Why are they permitting that?”</p><p>As the project’s financing came together, ERFSC’s then-executive director, Mae Best, signed a request for the property tax exemption for the Ethel, saying it was indirectly controlled by the nonprofit. The D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) then certified that the project qualified.</p><p>Diamond, the Georgetown law professor, said the agreement gives “absolutely no control, none” to ERFSC. The nonprofit “has at best an input, collaborative kind of role, not a controlling role,” he said.</p><p>Best told The Post that her organization was “just one of the community partners” in the development. “We are not the developer,” she said, referring questions to Donatelli.</p><p>When asked in September 2024 to more fully describe ERFSC’s role, Best declined to comment, citing advice from ERFSC’s lawyer. She retired at the end of that month. ERFSC’s CEO, Rahman Branch, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>DHCD spokesman Timothy Wilson said the tax relief certification was valid, without addressing the nonprofit’s lack of control.</p><p>The nearly $500,000 annual tax break results in further projected extra cash, enabling more money to go to the developers faster.</p><p>The Ethel cost nearly $800,000 per one-bedroom unit to develop, records show, making it the most expensive project on a per-unit basis that DCHFA had financed by 2021, when the deal closed.</p><p>Next door, the same developers built the Park Kennedy, for mostly market-rate tenants, for about $360,000 per unit, records show.</p><p>City officials have long viewed the Ethel and Park Kennedy as catalysts for upcoming development along the Anacostia waterfront, an area newly energized by the planned Commanders stadium.</p><p>Last year, Donatelli and Irving’s proposal for two more buildings on city land there won zoning approval. In September, a court overseeing Donatelli’s divorce found he had not paid what he owes under a postnuptial agreement. The court gave his ex-wife some authority over the company he and Irving set up for the next phase of development, so that she can arrange for the sale of his 50 percent stake in it.</p><p>Longtime Bowser critic Bill Slover, a former D.C. Housing Authority board member who believes the mayor’s development moves have unreasonably benefited developers, called the Ethel an “egregious giveaway under the guise of affordable housing.” When the project was up for review, he declined to vote on the city’s plan to allocate rental vouchers for use by the Ethel.</p><p>When the voucher question reached the D.C. Council in late 2019, Elissa Silverman, an at-large member at the time, joined the unanimous vote but only after rebuking the mayor’s office, which she said had not been forthcoming about the building’s subsidies.</p><p>The worthiness of the project, a visibly incensed Silverman, an independent, said on the dais before the vote, “doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t have the ability to question the subsidy to developers.”</p><p>“Both the mayor and her selected group of developers think that once you wave the magic wand of affordable housing, the debate’s over,” Silverman told The Post. “That’s sort of how the council deals with it, too. It’s like, ‘Oh, it’s affordable. We shouldn’t question it.’”</p>","headline":"How D.C. developers made big money on a taxpayer-funded housing project","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2025/dc-bowser-housing-homeless/","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T11:00:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Musty salt air crept at dusk over the nets and moored boats on northern Mozambique’s coast as seven armed and uniformed men marched into the fishing community last month, demanding the keys to the mosque.</p><p>Once inside, they commanded – over the microphone used for the call to prayer – that locals on the edge of the port town of Mocimboa da Praia come to listen.</p><p>It was only when they unfurled an ISIS banner, the mosque’s imam Sumail Issa told CNN, that it became clear who they were. Also palpable was the new-found confidence of the jihadists, emerging in recent months after the chaotic collapse of US aid funding to one of Africa’s poorest countries.</p><p>“When they called everyone over, as soon as they saw that flag, a colleague and I left, saying we needed the toilet,” Issa said, adding they went to notify the military.</p><p>The men’s faces were exposed, video posted to social media reveals, and the speech one of them gave was considered – delivering a highly localized manifesto, showing both ambition and independence from other ISIS franchises, analysts have noted.</p><p>Locals didn’t flee but attentively filmed, the social media video shows. ISIS had made their point about where they could roam, unopposed.</p><p>Mozambique’s gas-rich northern Cabo Delgado region has been ravaged by eight years of killing and land grabs. The insurgents seized control of this coastal town from August 2020 to August 2021, resulting in significant displacement and damage. Four years followed during which Mozambican and Rwandan forces – acting under invitation from Maputo – restored partial order, and Western governments surged aid into the region. Many of those who had fled the violence returned.</p><p>However, the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under an executive order from President Donald Trump in January cut some assistance entirely, and drastically reduced other programs, some of which were aimed at boosting the central government’s presence and curbing extremism.</p><p>On September 7, ISIS began a strident offensive again, hitting its former stronghold of Mocimboa da Praia, beheading dozens of mostly Christian men over the course of several weeks, and triggering the flight of tens of thousands of residents.</p><p>ISIS violence is surging in Africa, where 79% of the militant Islamist group’s global activity occurred between January and October this year, according to analysis by Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED). ISIS activity in Mozambique peaked in October, now responsible for 11% of its violent actions globally, ACLED said.</p><p>Over two months, CNN interviewed at least a dozen former USAID officials, dependent contractors, or aid workers and examined extensive internal documentation of USAID’s work in Mozambique, to assess the full impact of the USAID shutdown on one of Africa’s most vulnerable states.</p><p>Mozambique – where more than half the population lives under the poverty line and the average age is 17 – had been particularly dependent on USAID. The $586 million given by USAID in 2024 amounted to about 3% of the country’s GDP.</p><p>The funding, which according to documents seen by CNN retained just over $2.4 billion in ongoing or future projects when it was shuttered, provided emergency food aid, water supplies, education and local government support. HIV/AIDS medication was also funded and remains partially so, to a reported $160 million.</p><p>USAID also funded projects aimed at reducing ISIS’ ability to recruit. In Mocimboa da Praia, two grants supported projects targeting motorcycle taxi drivers and fishermen – areas of employment where poverty and a lack of opportunity make young men easy prey for the insurgency, according to USAID analysis.</p><p>A former senior USAID official told CNN: “The abrupt end of USAID programs … opened the door for insurgents to act with greater freedom and impunity.” Studies commissioned by USAID showed the Mozambique insurgency was ultimately fueled by “extreme poverty and marginalization, including an absolute lack of basic services like health and education,” said the former official, who didn’t want to be identified discussing sensitive areas of US policy.</p><p>The former official said USAID was “working directly to tackle those root causes” – feeding the displaced, helping local officials with schools and health clinics, and assisting young people in finding work.</p><p>“When those efforts suddenly stopped… it created a vacuum, as well as increased vulnerability and desperation. That vacuum gave insurgents more space to operate, whether through violence or by trying to win over local communities,” the former official said.</p><p>A State Department spokesperson said in a statement that the US government had continued to provide assistance this year in Mozambique, “a majority of which was life-saving food and nutrition assistance.” The spokesperson said foreign assistance was “constantly under review to ensure it meets the needs of the receiving country and the priorities of the United States.”</p><p>The State Department did not respond to CNN’s questions about the resurgence of ISIS following the withdrawal of US aid. Its statement added: “The United States continues to be the most generous nation in the world. This Administration is significantly enhancing the efficiency and strategic impact of foreign assistance programs around the world. We call on other nations to increase in burden sharing globally.”</p><p>Mocimboa da Praia is peppered with signs of international aid now interrupted. A hospital, its wards partially deserted as so many residents have fled the town with the recent surge in violence, received USAID funding via the local ministry of health. It let up to 15 staffers go initially when the money stopped. There is a lack of painkillers and anesthetics, the deputy director of the hospital, Dr. Orlando Colete, said.</p><p>In the market, a sense of frustration at vanished opportunities overflows. Motorcycle taxis are a vibrant part of the community, ferrying goods and people around town, but are also targets of ISIS recruitment – their skills equally useful to the insurgency. Aid worker Khamissa Fabaio ran a project, funded by USAID and implemented by international development contractor DAI, which provided vests, helmets and help with paperwork to the “mototaxistas,” improving their livelihood and hopefully steering them away from the insurgency.</p><p>Anger explodes among the crowd of marketgoers when CNN, accompanied by Fabaio, asks about people’s future prospects without aid. “You’re offending me, things in my house are my business,” shouts one man.</p><p>“The only way to stop the insurgency is to continue with this funding,” said Fabaio. “It is true that this will not solve the whole problem, but at least it keeps young people busy. Those who go into the jungle (to join the insurgents) do so because they want to save themselves. It’s utter despair.”</p><p>Fabaio said he had approached some insurgents, whose identities are known in the community, to join his project, and he pleaded for renewed international funding.</p><p>“That money has benefited us greatly. President Trump is a man who has to have a heart. Not all Mozambicans are corrupt; not all Africans are corrupt.” The project was halted in February with the USAID stop-work order.</p><p>Another project implemented by DAI, costing $70,000 over four months last year and due to continue into this, gave support to local fishermen. The idyllic coastline is littered with rickety boats that provide the main source of income for many.</p><p>The DAI project, part of a $24 million grant for local government assistance, USAID documents show, gave fishermen help with nets, motors and paperwork through a local group, while also monitoring them for early-warning signs of ISIS recruitment.</p><p>The group would watch out for fishing boats that did not return, perhaps because the men on board had been kidnapped by ISIS, local development worker Cadumo Sufo said. Most fisherman “are young, within the age range they hunt for recruitment,” he said. ISIS fighters are never far away. The mosque where they gave their speech on October 7 is just 900 meters (984 yards) along the bay.</p><p>The violence of the past eight years is so pervasive that its impact seems almost universal. Sufo’s fight to interrupt ISIS is acutely personal. More than six years ago, his two sons and daughter were kidnapped by the group and only the daughter has since escaped.</p><p>“When I say their names, I immediately remember my children, and I don’t feel good about it. I have nothing to say, just that the situation happened, and how sad it is for me… at this age.”</p><p>The town’s peripheries show its losses most clearly, the Christian neighborhood of Filipe Nyusi now an empty husk after ISIS night raids caused the community to flee. In early September, small groups of insurgents would trek across the fields into the community and knock on specific doors, survivors said, calling by name on those they had heard were wealthy.</p><p>One was Albano Nkwemba, 50, a security guard for local electric facilities. The CNN team was led to his home by his brother-in-law, Rafael Ndinengo, who was still visibly shaken as he walked past dozens of homes bereft of signs of life, poorly secured doors banging in the empty wind.</p><p>Ndinengo re-enacts the scene of Nkwemba’s death, outside a tiny mud-brick home, where USAID food sacks sit, their contents half-eaten on the wall. “He was tied up,” Ndinengo said, putting his arms behind his back, “and they took a stick and beat him. They cut off his head and put it on his bottom.”</p><p>He shows us the scene of another beheading, where he says a head was left on display. A total of eight men were killed in the raids, seven of whom were beheaded.</p><p>Nkwemba’s surviving family fled to the outskirts of Mueda, where they live in a rented house, desperately short of funds.</p><p>His wife, Germane Chiete, described how insurgents asked for her husband by name, leading the family to believe they had been helped by other locals.</p><p>“I kept quiet and they took me outside and beat me; I fell to the ground and they lifted me up. ‘You have to give us money,’ they said. After tying me up, they took me into the living room, laid me on the floor, while my husband was taken to the yard. They started praying, and then I heard the sound of a jet of blood.”</p><p>Mueda, a garrison town patrolled by tiny groups of military personnel, used to be a hub for aid efforts. After the USAID shutdown, international aid workers say, up to a dozen of their number suddenly left, and their offices closed.</p><p>Outside the town’s secure bubble, sprawling camps for the estimated 93,000 people displaced by the ISIS campaign struggle to meet their new burden.</p><p>Lianda displacement camp is among the more organized, yet there the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which received nearly half its Mozambique funding from USAID, provides only emergency food relief for newcomers, hoping to see them through a month.</p><p>Anouk Renard, NRC’s area manager, said: “Even before the USAID stopped, this was already an underfunded crisis. US funding was cut abruptly… So, we had some water provision in the camps that stopped. Some food distributions were suspended.”</p><p>The United Nations’ Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan for the conflict-stricken Cabo Delgado region initially requested $352 million from donors for 2025, later adjusting its target down to $126 million due to funding cuts. As of October, the UN says it has received $73.2 million, about a fifth of the original target, with only $3.5 million of that from the United States.</p><p>In late September, the US State Department pledged another $18 million in humanitarian aid for Cabo Delgado, according to Federica Zelada, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP). The United States, mostly through USAID, provided $98 million to the same appeal in 2024, $101 million in 2023, and $174.9 million in 2022, according to the UN.</p><p>Aid workers spoke broadly of the damaging impact not only of USAID cuts, but also of reduced contributions from other Western donors.</p><p>Maria Riabinina, a donor relations officer with the WFP, said the UN agency was helping around a million people in Mozambique at the start of 2024, but because of limited resources had to reduce the number to around 345,000. “2026 looks very bleak at this point and (there’s) no clarity on what extent we will be able to continue the assistance,” she added.</p><p>Ulrika Blom, NRC’s country director for Mozambique, called the aid it was able to provide an “emergency response, the response that is given to newly displaced people that are in extreme stress. It is limited funding, and we see now that we cannot help them, and it’s very, very stressful.”</p><p>Meanwhile Nicholas Wasunna, of UN children’s agency UNICEF, said the cuts meant “we have to make very tough choices. This means we focus on life saving, as opposed to more of the wider livelihoods.”</p><p>Yet within an hour’s drive of this expanding crisis lies the potential for extraordinary wealth that could transform Mozambique: liquid natural gas (LNG) fields located off the coast of nearby Palma town, itself also wracked by insurgent violence, and increasingly surrounded by private security firms hoping to isolate the hydrocarbon wealth from the chaos of ISIS’s campaign.</p><p>Both French giant Total Energies and US behemoth Exxon Mobil have invested heavily in the planned Afungi plants near Palma. Protected by heavy fencing, their development has been delayed by years because of the region’s insecurity, including an insurgent attack on the town in 2021 that killed dozens, including foreign workers.</p><p>Yet in late October, Total Energies said it could soon lift its declaration of “force majeure” – a technical term used to describe unanticipated events that might grant relief from contractual obligations – suggesting progress in the field’s development might be nearer. Exxon Mobil has said it will decide whether to progress with its project next year.</p><p>The Trump administration, while massively reducing aid to Mozambique, has invested in the potential of the Afungi project. The US Export-Import Bank in March loaned $4.7 billion to Mozambique’s LNG entity, to enable it to hire US-based expertise to complete the project.</p><p>Yet the challenges of launching a complex, multi-billion-dollar gas plant, in the shadow of a spiraling insurgency that has openly stated its desire to disrupt the project, are mounting.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>When Ahtisa Manalo set foot on the Miss Universe stage for this year’s final, millions of people in the Philippines watched, dissecting her every move.</p><p>As her country’s representative, the 28-year-old has long felt the pressure of a pageant-crazed nation, where beauty contests — big and small — are part of mainstream culture.</p><p>“In the Philippines, people stop and tune in, usually for three things: the three B’s,” Manalo explained ahead of the event. “Boxing, when Manny Pacquiao fights. Basketball, you’ll see courts everywhere. And beauty pageants.”</p><p>“Beauty queens are usually sources of stories, of inspiration. We’re still a developing country,” she said. “We like stories that inspire us to do better and work harder.</p><p>Manalo placed in the top five at Miss Universe, the third runner-up among 120 contestants. Her success is the latest example of the Philippines producing some of the world’s most competitive queens.</p><p>A national pastime, hundreds if not thousands of pageants are held year-round in schools, plazas and village halls, with many tied to celebrations and religious festivals. The most cutthroat are at the national and international level, and beauty boot camps have sprung up to train aspiring titleholders.</p><p>The sheer number of contests has generated a lucrative pageant industry, an ecosystem comprising coaches, fashion designers, costume makers, social media influencers and more.</p><p>“It takes a village to create a beauty queen,” said Miss Universe Philippines CEO and president Jonas Gaffud, nicknamed the “Queenmaker.”</p><p>“A lot of people depend on the industry.”</p><p>At a small competition in Lamot Dos, a barangay (neighborhood) in Laguna province, the stakes feel surprisingly high. But such local pageants are where many top queens will get their start.</p><p>It’s as if the entire community has spilled onto a covered court to witness the search for “Mister” and “Miss” Lamot Dos. The noise is deafening as spectators blow plastic horns and scream out contestant’s names, waving giant placards bearing their images.</p><p>The makeshift backstage area is similarly chaotic, with a swarm of makeup artists and hairstylists ducking in and around a web of curling irons and light cords. Competitors hastily rehearse advocacy speeches off their phones and change into flamboyant costumes.</p><p>“This is my first pageant,” said 21-year-old Mark Glenn Cosico, in a feathery ensemble paying tribute to the “Ibon-Ebon” or “Birds and Eggs” festival. “This is the time I can prove myself to my family.”</p><p>In a sparkly gold getup, 17-year-old Uricah Mae Latayan said pageants have “built her confidence,” and she really wants to win. “It’s about the pride.”</p><p>National pride and a strong sense of Filipino identity are woven through the event. Ahead of the frenetic opening runway parade, attendees and spectators join in prayer before a video montage showcases the country’s most beautiful landscapes. The audience hushes, with some people placing hands over their hearts, as “Tagumpay Nating Lahat,” a 1990s track evoking Filipino spirit and unity by singer Lea Salonga, blasts through the speakers.</p><p>A bombastic, hours-long competition ensues.</p><p>Pageantry’s roots in the Philippines trace back to Spanish rule in the 16th century, as colonialists used religious festivals, or fiestas, to evangelize the population while incorporating indigenous traditions into the elaborate processions and celebratory feasts.</p><p>This made the islands “fertile ground” for pageants as we know them today, helping modern beauty contests “take shape and really have a stronghold in the Philippines,” said Genevieve Alva Clutario, the author of “Beauty Regimes: A History of Power and Modern Empire in the Philippines, 1898-1941.”</p><p>“It makes sense for folks,” she said. “Everyone can participate.”</p><p>In 1908, the Philippines, then under American rule, played host to the Manila Carnival — an event similar to the World’s Fairs, that was intended by the US to show the archipelago’s progress. The search for the event’s “queen” became the country’s earliest beauty pageant. Established as a fundraiser for the annual carnival, the contest invited the public to vote for their favorite candidates by purchasing ballots through newspapers.</p><p>The inaugural event named two winners: A “Queen of the Occident,” an American from Illinois, and a “Queen of the Orient,” selected from the Filipina contestants, after a cheating scandal broke out. (There were accusations that the contest was rigged to favor an American to win, despite the obvious popularity of Filipina contestants among fans.)</p><p>According to Clutario, during the coronation the local queen Pura Villanueva Kalaw, had to give her crown to her colonial counterpart Marjorie Colton, symbolizing she too, was the Manila Carnival Queen. But the optics of it “was a kind of fury that was expressed in nationalism.”</p><p>People “galvanized” around Villanueva Kalaw and started talking about the Philippines “as if it’s a nation… but there’s no nation. This is the height of US colonialism,” Clutario explained. So in a “totally unintended consequence,” the contest becomes a “platform for anti-colonial nationalism in this really funny way.”</p><p>Over the following decades, smaller fairs begin hosting their own contests, each with “varied and competing” notions of beauty, Clutario wrote in her book. The Manila Carnival, in turn, became a “complex system” of organizations, spanning business, trade and the state. Filipinos started promoting the Philippines as “the land of beauty queens,” and the Manila Carnival Queen was renamed Miss Philippines in the 1920s.</p><p>Pageants continued growing in popularity after the US relinquished control over the Philippines following World War II.</p><p>Then in 1969, Gloria Diaz sparked nationwide hysteria by becoming the first Filipina to win Miss Universe. “Suddenly there’s a Filipina thrust into the limelight, into the world,” said Voltaire Tayag, the executive vice president of the Miss Universe Philippines organization. Diaz’s victory came at a time when television was becoming more widely available in the country, Tayag said, adding that people who couldn’t afford TV sets would watch through neighbors’ windows, inadvertently fostering a sense of community.</p><p>“A lot of people took so much pride in that,” Tayag said of Diaz’s famous win. And interest in the event exploded again when the country hosted the pageant for the first time, a few years later, in 1974.</p><p>Today, the Philippines ranks fourth in the world for Miss Universe titles (after the US, Venezuela and Puerto Rico), with Catriona Gray and Pia Wurtzbach both taking the crown in the last decade. Both are now household names in the country, where pageant fans are even known to name their daughters after recent winners, he added.</p><p>The Philippines has also titled and placed at Miss World, Miss International and Miss Earth, which are — along with Miss Universe — known as the “Big Four.”</p><p>With an estimated 10 million Filipinos living overseas, interest in pageantry also stretches far beyond the country’s shores, into the diaspora, said Clutario, who grew up in a Filipino household in Los Angeles. “Miss Universe was on in the same way the Lakers’ game championships was on,” she said.</p><p>“There aren’t many things where, as a nation, Filipinos dominate. And they break a lot of records. So it becomes something you can invest in as a winner.</p><p>“Even if you are against it, or highly critical of it, the power is still there.”</p><p>Pageants reflect societal attitudes, and have often been criticized for promoting outdated, misogynistic or Eurocentric beauty ideals. They can also perpetuate race-related prejudices such as colorism, which stem from the country’s colonial past.</p><p>The issue goes beyond pageants — TV shows, films and fashion campaigns, have also historically cast thin, lighter-skinned Filipino actors and models in major roles.</p><p>Former Miss Universe Philippines contestant Ayn Bernos said competing in the pageant in 2021 distorted her body image, as fans openly picked apart her and other participants’ appearance online. Similarly, she would hear terms like “Barbie arms” — evoking the doll’s “super skinny” features — used to praise contestants and feel pressure to lose weight. Another online “basher” gave her “constructive feedback” Bernos said sarcastically, by recommending she get her “full” cheeks, which she once saw as a sign of youth, “chopped off or shrunken.”</p><p>“Something that, oddly enough, was used to insult me when I was competing was, ‘You look like a common Filipino,’” she recounted.</p><p>“I came into the competition knowing fully that I look like a typical Filipina. I’m 5’3,” it’s like a very average height here. Brown skin, very average, you see it everywhere. Even my features — round face, small nose. I see myself in so many people.”</p><p>Bernos embraces her beauty and said that, in recent years, attitudes have been shifting.</p><p>Last year, Chelsea Manalo (no relation to Ahtisa) made history by becoming the first Black Filipina to be crowned Miss Universe Philippines, with many social media users celebrating how she “shattered” traditional beauty standards.</p><p>Bullied as a kid for her dark complexion, the beauty queen used to wonder if she needed to cover up her skin with long sleeves or use whitening products. “Being a woman of color was never really the standard,” she said. “It was a fight.”</p><p>“Here in the Philippines, we’re so diverse in culture, and there are so many women, also, who look like me,” she added. “Finally they have an image that they think, ‘If Chelsea won the crown, maybe I can too.’”</p><p>Pageants themselves are diversifying, too. Male and LGBTQ+ beauty contests are increasingly popular. Last month, Manila hosted the finale of Mrs. Universe, a competition for married, divorced and widowed women, who have long been excluded from major pageants (the Miss Universe Organization only lifted a rule requiring contestants to be single and childless in 2023).</p><p>Held this year in Bangkok, Thailand, Miss Universe is Ahtisa Manalo’s 18th — and last — pageant.</p><p>Growing up poor in Quezon province, she competed in her first pageant at 10 years old to win free school tuition. She continued to place highly, putting herself through college with a combination of scholarships and pageant prize money.</p><p>Throughout her career, Manolo has overcome various stumbling blocks — including a quite literal one. On the way to winning Miss Universe Philippines in May, she tripped and fell during the evening gown round.</p><p>When it happened, I swear it went really quiet,” she said. Manalo swiftly regained her poise, smiling as she got back up, further endearing herself to the roaring audience. “I didn’t know it could be louder. I felt the vibration of everyone.”</p><p>Since taking the national title half a year ago, Manolo’s schedule has been “erratic,” she said. The pageant veteran’s 12- to 16-hour days have been filled with photo shoots for magazines and brand campaigns, TV interviews, events and, of course, practice sessions.</p><p>But during moments of exhaustion along the way, Manolo has reminded herself of how much her country is invested in her.</p><p>“There’s always the pressure that you carry the Philippines sash with you because of the women who came before you, who did well,” she explained. “And in that sense, it’s a pressure in itself that you also have to do well. You have to make the Philippines proud.</p><p>“But it’s something that drives queens like me because that pressure comes from support. It means that people are paying attention to what you’re doing.”</p><p>Watch Ahtisa Manalo’s journey on All Access.

{"details":"<p>The moment Brazilian pop sensation Liniker walked into Amoeba Music in Hollywood, the crowd roared. Fans lifted their phones, snapping pictures with one hand and clutching her Latin Grammy-winning record on the other, many still buzzing from watching her performance at the awards show days earlier.</p><p>The Latin Grammys were one of the biggest nights of the singer and songwriter’s career — for the second time. In 2022, Liniker was the first-ever out transgender artist to win a Latin Grammy. In 2025, she entered the ceremony with seven nominations, the most ever for a Brazilian artist, and walked away with three major wins in categories honoring music in her native language – Portuguese-language contemporary pop album, song and urban performance.</p><p>Her breakthrough album “Caju” — a bold fusion of Brazilian groove-based pop, neo-soul, samba, disco, and jazz — has turned her into one of the most celebrated Brazilian artists of the decade. Critics from the LA Times to Rolling Stone have praised the project’s intimacy and ambition. Over the past couple years, she has collaborated with giants of Brazilian music like Milton Nascimento and the late Elza Soares, and took the stage in front of 2 million people in Copacabana after Lady Gaga’s historic concert in May.</p><p>“I’ve been living a life of dreams – receiving awards, being successful, being a huge artist in my country and now I’m starting my career out of Brazil, but I know my reality, and I know the reality of my community,” Liniker told CNN in an interview before her record store event.</p><p>Liniker, born Liniker de Barros Ferreira Campos and named after English soccer star Gary Lineker, was raised in a home where samba, rock, and soul were always playing. Her working-class family lived in Araraquara, a city of 250,000 just outside the edges of São Paulo’s cultural reach.</p><p>Black, trans, and from a modest upbringing, her stardom is remarkable in any context, but in Brazil, where the lives of Black trans women are so often marked by danger rather than possibility, it feels nothing short of astonishing.</p><p>Brazil holds a stark and somber distinction: It is the deadliest country in the world for transgender people, according to the National Registry of Trans Deaths compiled by Rede Trans Brasil, a nonprofit organization advocating for trans rights.</p><p>The report documented 105 killings in 2024, but that number is widely understood to be an undercount. Data is compiled from publicly available information such as local media reports, social media posts, and police reports, but those often fail to register a victim’s gender identity, and many deaths likely never make it into the dataset at all. Most of the victims were young, Black and poor.</p><p>None of that is lost on Liniker. As the awards and recognition push her into the spotlight, she said she has to remind herself to “not be delusional.”</p><p>“Fame doesn’t exempt me from being subjected to violence — whether online or in the streets,” she said. “Even though today I have a structure around me — a team that protects me, security, all these things that many people from my reality, from my community, don’t have — none of that changes the fact that I’m a trans person.”</p><p>A ballroom legend, an aspiring model and a young athlete: Some of the trans people lost to violence and suicide this year</p><p>And online, she said, there is no way to brace for the backlash.</p><p>“It’s awful, because with every victory, the wave of praise comes mixed with an equal wave of violence and harassment,” she said.</p><p>The more visible she becomes, the harsher the comments, the stalking, the threats.</p><p>“I thought I was protected, but now I know I’m not. The more I go into the light, the more the violence comes to me too.”</p><p>At 30, Liniker is celebrating four Latin Grammys — a milestone many artists wait a lifetime to reach — yet, she admits the duality is dizzying. The glamour, the global stages, the adoring fans at Amoeba; and, at the same time, a country where people like her are routinely targeted.</p><p>“Being recognized as a songwriter, someone who writes her own story, in a country that kills the most trans and Black people in the world… that carries a weight,” she said.</p><p>Liniker sees her work — writing, singing, composing — as an act of offering, a way of sending love outward, even when hostility circles back. Even in her most energetic songs, like “Negona dos Olhos Terríveis,” (Black woman with terrible eyes, in Portuguese), which she performed at the Latin Grammys, her sound is still soft, landing like a feather and never harsh.</p><p>The epitome of this style can be heard in the track “Veludo Marrom,” (Brown Velvet), which was written and co-produced by Liniker and one of the tracks that won her a Latin Grammy.</p><p>The seven-minute ballad opens with a jazzy guitar, and Liniker’s warm timbre slowly builds up, with sprinkles of birdsong, singing: “I don’t feel like letting go / but I want to make peace from the days / to make a big to-do about your smile / I don’t care, we can take our time.”</p><p>The description of an intimate lazy morning with a lover slowly turns brighter as she recites song verses almost like prayer. With each line, a new layer of instruments from Brasil Jazz Sinfônica Orchestra joins in; piano, then strings, drums, and finally, a full choir, taking the song from personal to universal, from physical to ethereal.</p><p>Her music has drawn the admiration of artists across the world.</p><p>Sophie Hawley-Weld, of the Electronic duo Sofi Tukker, who collaborated with Liniker on a song earlier this year, said “she has the aura of someone who knows herself profoundly and has a rich spiritual life.”</p><p>“Her voice and music reflect the same,” Hawley-Weld said.</p><p>Fellow Brazilian singer and songwriter Catto thinks the universality of Liniker’s music is responsible for her success. “This record touches people’s hearts, and that’s why she can take it to the whole world,” Catto told CNN on the phone from São Paulo.</p><p>Catto, a rising star with powerhouse vocals and long-standing presence in Brazil’s LGBTQ+ cultural scene, said watching Liniker’s success feels both personal and historic.</p><p>“There’s the side that’s about representation, which is so important for our community,” Catto said. “But there’s also the personal side: I’m her friend. I know how deeply this win comes from her life, her journey.”</p><p>But Liniker’s significance does not begin or end with identity, she emphasized.</p><p>“The fact that she’s a trans woman is, in a way, a detail. And at the same time, the fact that she is a trans woman means everything to us,” she said. “But she doesn’t need a label. Her music speaks for itself.”</p><p>That admiration is shared widely in Brazil’s artistic circles, but the response from mainstream audiences has been just as striking.</p><p>In May, Liniker spent a morning on live television with Ana Maria Braga, a talk-show host on a beloved morning show whose impact on Brazilian culture is often compared to Martha Stewart’s in the United States.</p><p>A slender woman in her 60s with short blonde hair, Braga sat beside Liniker on a set designed to look like a family breakfast table as the singer reflected on her 11-year musical career, her personal journey and her family life. Between conversation breaks, Liniker performed — her velvety voice flowing into millions of Brazilian homes.</p><p>As viewers sent in comments through the show’s online channels, Braga read a few aloud.</p><p>“Ana Maria is charmed by Liniker, just like us. So beautiful to see her in this place getting all this recognition,” she read, her voice breaking. Then, holding back tears and looking into Liniker’s eyes, she told the singer, “We meet so many people in this life, but sometimes we meet people, you know?”</p><p>Before moving on, Braga read one last message: “Society needs to see trans people on TV, doing cool things, showing their genuine talent, so that the masks of prejudice may fall.”</p><p>Braga paused after concluding and spoke to the viewers who had written in. “I have nothing else to say … you’ve said it all.”</p><p>For Liniker, the sentiment resonates deeply.</p><p>“We need to be recognized as human beings,” she said. “It’s not even about acceptance; we don’t need acceptance. What we’re asking for is the most basic thing: respect.”</p><p>Back at the record store surrounded by fans, Liniker posed for selfies, signed vinyl records and listened patiently as people shared their stories as her album played on the speakers. The first person in line — a young fan who looked to be in their 20s — told her that Liniker had inspired her to learn to sing.</p><p>Her message to the Black, trans, or queer youth who are watching her star rise, Liniker said, is simple: “Be kind with yourself and respect your soul, always.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Being a professional athlete, especially in the NFL, creates a unique brotherhood.</p><p>On the field, players compete tooth-and-nail against one another, often delivering some of the most violent and brutal hits that can be imagined. Off the field, they often regularly rely on one another for guidance as they navigate an almost unimaginable life of athletic stardom.</p><p>One of the quickest-growing connections throughout the league is in players’ philanthropic efforts, which are on full display in the next two weeks for the league’s My Cause My Cleats event.</p><p>“I have yet to come across a player in the many locker rooms that I’ve been in through the years that doesn’t have a desire to help, that doesn’t have a desire to make an impact to those less fortunate, or maybe injured, or the widows and the orphans of the world,” Miles Killebrew, a safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers, said.</p><p>The My Cause My Cleats event is a two-week campaign during which NFL players get to show off a little of their personal style while promoting the causes that are nearest to their hearts. The player-led initiative brings hundreds of personal causes to the forefront and gives each player a chance to show a bit more of their off-the-field personality during games.</p><p>Austin Hooper, a tight end for the New England Patriots, will be promoting the work his foundation is doing to support kids who are aging out of the foster care system. That work is born out of his own experience with a foster child living with his family when he was a kid.</p><p>“I don’t really think I’ve actually said this publicly before, but like, a part of me kind of felt a little guilty because I remember growing up when we’re thinking about having a foster care kid come stay with us full time,” Hooper told CNN Sports. “And I remember me and my siblings, we weren’t like against it, but … all three of us were really little, and we kind of felt bad that  we would treat him right, but everyone else in the community would know that he wasn’t our family.</p><p>“So, kind of selfishly, when I got in the position, I was like, ‘Look, man, you messed that one up big time when you were a little kid, didn’t know any better. You got to kind of try to make this right.’”</p><p>It’s a chance to show off what Brian Hooks, the chairman and CEO of Stand Together, calls a “philanthropic locker room” – a term he attributed to New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis – in which players can work together to accomplish the goals they’ve set for themselves in their community work. Hooks said his organization has worked with Killebrew and other NFL players to connect them with charities that work in areas that they’re passionate about.</p><p>“This isn’t about two weeks. It’s not even about what happens on game day,” Hooks told CNN Sports. “This is about a movement, a yearlong, player-led movement that helps people who want to make a difference take the next step, to get engaged in their communities.”</p><p>While the NFL has other league-wide events – such as Salute to Service early in November and Crucial Catch in October for breast cancer awareness – the My Cause My Cleats weeks allow players to promote their own individual causes.</p><p>“While we were the ones for years saying we have so many guys who care, and here’s what this person is doing and here’s what this guy’s doing, we don’t have to do it anymore in the same way,” Anna Isaacson, the league’s senior vice president of social responsibility, said to CNN Sports, “because this campaign allows players to have the platform to take the NFL’s marketing muscle and really showcase who they are as humans and what they care about.”</p><p>The causes that players choose can be born out of life experiences as unique as the players themselves.</p><p>Hooper’s foundation works with foster children to provide material things – clothes, shoes, laptops, etc. – and provide mental health services.</p><p>“When you think of foster care, obviously you think of the infant. You think of the toddler. You don’t think of the 17-, 18-,19-year-old young man or woman that, depending on which state you’re in, you know, get a GED maybe, and $100 and it’s like, ‘All right, good luck. Go play life in America,’” Hooper said. “That’s a tough prospect. So, when I was made aware of that. I just kind of try to … kind of fill that role.”</p><p>For Killebrew, he’s been working with various charities since he entered the league but is representing Café Momentum during this season’s My Cleats My Cause.</p><p>Inspired by his parents, the former Detroit Lions safety has always had “a heart to serve.” He was connected with Café Momentum by former Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander and has since fallen in love with the group.</p><p>“The fact that Cafe Momentum, they take youth who are have some run in with the justice system (and) their reputation … is now tarnished to the world,” Killebrew said. “They take them and say, ‘No, you’re not your biggest mistake.’ They say, ‘You get a second chance.’ And they introduce them to the to the restaurant industry, and they provide them with everything that they need, all of the resources, all of the support to then reinvent themselves.”</p><p>He added, “It is so cool to see the transformation in these youth when all they have is someone saying that they believe in them. I wanted to be on board with that. That spoke to my heart and aligned with what I really wanted to achieve while I’m in the league, and I’ve been on board ever since.”</p><p>Isaacson told CNN Sports she had no doubt that My Cause My Cleats would be a success during its first season in the league. What’s surprised her is the passion players show each and every year as the campaign now enters its 10th season.</p><p>“It was hundreds of guys from the start,” Isaacson said. “So, I mean, I think we’ve been impressed that it has sustained itself … and every year there is a significant number of players who want to participate. But I think from year one, we were impressed by the number of guys who opted into this campaign.”</p><p>In a world of extreme attention on uniform uniformity – the NFL has 64 employees whose only job is to look for dress code violations on game day – there is not exactly a lot of room for displays of personality and individuality in the NFL uniform.</p><p>But being allowed to have flashy, loud shoes for even just a couple games can reveal a lot about the league, NFL senior vice president of player operations Tracy Perlman said to CNN Sports.</p><p>“This personalizes it for the fan, because fans see, ‘Oh, wait a minute, this player cares about foster care. This player cares about domestic violence,’” she said. “So I feel like it fits in perfectly, because it’s like, here are the pillars of what we do in the community, and here are all of the things that the NFL is touching through players and clubs.”</p><p>The players enjoy having those moments where they can show off their causes and their personalities.</p><p>Killebrew said he works closely with the artists who design his cleats and – though he won’t be able to play this year, due to a knee injury that ended his season last month – he was able to show kids working with Café Momentum that their faces would be featured on the cleats.</p><p>“We’re able to also have the actual youth that we’re representing like on our cleat, and we get to show them like in person,” he said. “We went down to Café Momentum with … (Steelers linebacker) Malik Harrison and (Steelers tight end) Connor Heyward and we were able to go down there and actually show them like, ‘Hey, this is our cleat we’re gonna wear this. That’s you on our cleat.’ And it was just cool to see the look on their face and just kind of that enjoyment, that excitement behind it.”</p><p>Hooper is a little less involved in the design – “I wear a helmet, they’re the artists,” he said – but loves playing while knowing that he’s representing his foundation.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say there’s more pressure,” he said, “I would say I actually have more fun. … When you’re out there, you got to be locked in on your job and be ready to get after it. But, I look at it a different way. This is a fun day. I get to do something that normally I wouldn’t do, other than, you know, my plain Jane cleats that I wear, something fun.</p><p>“And of course, when I got them on, I definitely want to score, for sure – put a stamp on ‘em wearing those.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A Washington resident died of complications from an infection with a bird flu strain never before reported in humans, the state Department of Health said on Friday.</p><p>The patient was an older adult with underlying health conditions who had been hospitalized and undergoing treatment for infection with H5N5 avian influenza.</p><p>It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months and only the second reported human death from the virus in the United States, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.</p><p>Officials continue to monitor others who were in close contact with the person, but no one else has tested positive for bird flu, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.</p><p>“The person had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds,” the Washington State Department of Health said in a statement. “DOH sampling identified avian influenza virus in the environment of the flock, making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”</p><p>Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.</p><p>Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the outbreak, according to the CDC. Another elderly person with underlying conditions died in January after a bird flu infection.</p><p>Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.</p><p>The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.  Officials also advise using caution when cleaning bird feeders or other areas exposed to bird feces. Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.</p><p>The Washington health department also recommends flu shots for anyone who may come into contact with domestic or wild birds. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The first time Mwezi Mugerwa saw the African golden cat, he didn’t know what it was.</p><p>While reviewing camera trap footage at Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the conservation biologist spotted an unfamiliar creature around twice the size of a domestic cat in the grainy black-and-white footage.</p><p>None of his colleagues could identify it; “but, when I talked to the hunters and communities who lived around the park, they knew the species,” Mugerwa recalls.</p><p>Known as Embaka in the local language, the “cryptic” golden cat was often caught accidentally in forest snares.</p><p>“That was really concerning for me — that we may lose this species before we even get to know about it,” says Mugerwa.</p><p>Over the past 16 years, Mugerwa has dedicated his career to “Africa’s least known, least understood, least studied big cat.” Found in dense tropical forests across Central and Western Africa, the species is so elusive that the last IUCN assessment — over a decade old — has no population estimates, and in all his years of fieldwork, Mugerwa has only managed a fleeting glimpse of the African golden cat three times with his own eyes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world’s largest environmental network of government and society organizations, tracks threatened wildlife.</p><p>“They’re really, really difficult to see in the wild,” says Mugerwa, who won the Indianapolis Prize Emerging Conservationist Award earlier this year for his work on the species.</p><p>But, realizing that accurately counting the big cats was the first step to protecting them, he set out to conduct the first population census across the species’ range, expected to publish next year.</p><p>Meet the Welsh puppies that are stopping wildlife poachers in Africa</p><p>Mugerwa knew that gathering data on the African golden cat wasn’t something he could do on his own. So, in 2019, he founded the African Golden Cat Conservation Alliance (AGCCA), a network of 46 conservationists across 19 countries.</p><p>Together, they launched a standardized camera trap survey across the cat’s suspected range, supported by funding from the National Geographic Society.</p><p>But manually reviewing thousands of images from 30 sites across 19 countries — the largest camera trap grid for any African wildlife species, says Mugerwa — “was really, really painful.”</p><p>At the same time, US-headquartered nonprofit Panthera, another of Mugerwa’s collaborators, was developing an AI algorithm that could quickly sort the images and identify individual cats based on their unique coat patterns, similar to how tiger stripes are used like fingerprints.</p><p>“That’s really important, because now we are able to speak to number and density,” says Mugerwa, adding that without AI, distinguishing individual cats would be nearly impossible due to their small size and subtle markings.</p><p>Preliminary data suggests the species exists at low densities — even in protected habitats. In Uganda and Gabon, for example, surveys found just 16 individuals per 100 square kilometers.</p><p>The surveys have also revealed the true impact of poaching: in areas with hunting restrictions, Mugerwa says cat populations were up to 50% higher, with wider distribution. The study has also observed that while the cats are active both day and night, many are strictly nocturnal — likely to avoid human activity during the day, he adds.</p><p>Establishing population numbers was just the first step. Early in his research, Mugerwa realized that hunting was the cat’s primary threat.</p><p>In East Africa, where Mugerwa is based, the African golden cat is rarely the target of hunters. But bushmeat snares, set for pigs and antelopes, are indiscriminate, often catching other species unintentionally. In 2019, Mugerwa received reports of 80 golden cats caught in snares in three Ugandan forests, 88% of which were accidental.</p><p>“We are dealing with a bushmeat crisis: the level of hunting ongoing in this forest is unsustainable and out of control,” he says, adding: “The species is being pushed to the edge of extinction in many of its range countries.”</p><p>To combat the cat’s biggest threat, Mugerwa went directly to the residents, creating Embaka: the first community-based anti-poaching conservation project focused on the African golden cat.</p><p>Meet the conservationist saving gorillas in Uganda’s ‘impenetrable forest’</p><p>Working with over 8,000 families across the cat’s range, including Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Uganda, the project engages local communities — many of whom are former poachers — to deploy camera traps and report sightings.</p><p>“We have learned a lot from local communities; the range expansion, for instance, some of that data comes from hunters,” says Mugerwa. Embaka offers incentives like dental care and livestock support to encourage communities to “speak out against hunting” and protect the forest ecosystem.</p><p>Bringing reformed hunters on board not only reduces the threat the cats will face from hunting, but it also “improves the relationship between the African golden cat and the communities,” says Mugerwa.</p><p>“It also allows the local communities to own and to be part of the camera trap grid, which is really beautiful to see,” he adds.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Celebrated photographer and conservationist Beverly Joubert is lucky to be alive. She died — four times by her husband Dereck’s count — working in Botswana in March 2017.</p><p>The Jouberts were in the bush in the Okavango Delta, when a buffalo, a creature they had extensive experience with, knocked Dereck down, before impaling his wife. The horn entered under her arm, passing through her chest, lacerated her neck and went up into her face.</p><p>“Beverly died in my arms twice and I was able to pull her back,” Dereck Joubert told CNN. “Then again in the medical plane, then again in the hospital.”</p><p>Seven surgeons and eighteen hours later, Beverly Joubert began the long road to recovery. “I now have 41 screws in (my) face and seven plates, so I am a little bionic,” she said with a gentle smile, sitting next to her husband on a video call.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have survived,” Beverly Joubert  reflected. But the incident, far from causing the couple to withdraw from the wild, only reaffirmed their commitment to protecting it, she explained.</p><p>The South African-born Jouberts are National Geographic Society Explorers at Large, and have lived in Botswana for 40 years, recording landscapes and animals across Southern Africa in still photography and more than two dozen documentary films.</p><p>Now they have compiled Beverly Joubert’s photography into a hefty art book titled “Wild Eye: A Life in Photographs.”</p><p>There are the expected photographs: perilous wildebeest migrations and languorous leopards. There are also the remarkable and sometimes shocking images. For instance, Beverly Joubert’s photographs of lions successfully hunting elephants at night — the first time it had ever been documented, the Jouberts believe.</p><p>“It was this mysterious thing that we’d heard in the dark and never seen,” said Dereck Joubert.</p><p>During the dry season in 1997, wildlife began converging at the Savute watering hole in Chobe National Park, Botswana, including herds of elephants. Some confused calves were separated from their herds and became targets for lions. After a successful kill, the lions soon turned on the adults.</p><p>“At 2 a.m., they jumped on a 21-year-old elephant cow,” Beverly Joubert said. What ensued was a long and bloody tussle, with the lions emerging victorious. “It was evident to us that lions can adapt remarkably fast to the situation,” she added.</p><p>The couple documented the behavior after years of research — a luxury that wouldn’t be afforded to many photographers, and certainly not those who parachute in on assignment.</p><p>“That’s our life,” said Dereck Joubert. “These things are happening all around us, all the time … We’re the first to see it. If some new behavior starts emerging, you don’t read about it in some scientific paper. It takes time. There’s no magic sauce here except time.”</p><p>The duo has forged relationships with certain creatures; their bond is reflected in Beverly Joubert’s most intimate shots. Legadema, a leopard driven away by her mother after a botched hunt, is one example. The animal is one half of a famed 2004 image alongside a day-old baboon. Legadema had just killed the infant’s mother, and the Jouberts were anticipating the leopard would do the same to the infant. Instead, “she moved into nurturing this tiny new baby,” said Beverly Joubert.</p><p>For her husband, it embodies what makes an image iconic. “It’s a question mark,” he said. “What happened before this? And what’s going to happen next?”</p><p>Nature documentaries often have a penchant for anthropomorphism; transposing human-like narratives on animals. While saying there’s a need to stop short of defining the inner lives of their subjects, Derek Joubert argued, “it’s folly to avoid the notion that animals are like us in some way.”</p><p>“They’re mammals like we are,” he added. “They have brains, they have reactions. Think about elephants: they have the ability to think (of) the past, present and future; to communicate … Many of these sacrosanct emotions are indeed not unique to us.”</p><p>The Jouberts’ proximity to nature has made observing its struggles more heartbreaking.</p><p>In Africa, lions have disappeared from 95% of their historic range, cheetahs 90% of their historic range, with leopards and other big cats confronting decline also, according to the Big Cats Initiative, which the couple manages.</p><p>“One can respond to that in one of two ways,” said Dereck Joubert. “One is to go, ‘The world is burning, it’s finished.’ Or, ‘What can we do about that?’”</p><p>They chose the latter. Nearly 20 years ago, the Jouberts began leasing land from governments and communities, establishing Great Plains Conservation, a safari operation which now spans Botswana, Kenya and Zimbabwe.</p><p>The 15 safari camps employ roughly 1,000 people, fostering an economy built around preserving nature (in turn, deterring poaching), while managing over 1.5 million acres.</p><p>Proceeds help support the Great Plains Foundation, which oversees the Big Cats Initiative and other conservation programs.</p><p>“What we do with our work as emergency conservationists is look for opportunities within this ever-changing world to regrow and to rewild,” explained Dereck Joubert.</p><p>One opportunity is through animal translocation, moving animals from high density to low density areas in Southern Africa — a solution becoming increasingly necessary as safe spaces for animals are fenced off, and in some cases, required to maintain genetic diversity.</p><p>The alternative is culling, and “conservation with a bullet is not a form of conservation,” said Beverly Joubert.</p><p>Through multiple initiatives including Rhinos Without Borders, the Jouberts have been involved in large-scale animal translocations, including moving 100 elephants across Zimbabwe, and airlifting 87 rhinos via airplane and helicopter to a secret location in Botswana between 2016 and 2018.</p><p>Translocation is not cheap, said Dereck Joubert, estimating it costs around $10,000 to move an elephant across a country, and $45,000 to move a rhino. But it’s paying off; Beverly Joubert notes that from the 87 rhinos translocated in Botswana, 90 calves have already been born in the wild.</p><p>The Jouberts estimate they raise and distribute between $3-$10 million every year for conservation and community enterprise purposes. As well as employment opportunities, Great Plains has created schools and other education programs in remote areas near their camps, and distributed 7.8 million meals to ﻿Maasai children in Kenya.</p><p>Along with their documentary and photography work, this, they say, will be their legacy.</p><p>“I think our life’s narrative … needs to be built on care and compassion and being kind to everything around us — elephants, school children, old grandmothers, rhinos. I think too often in our society we discard people in need,” said Derek Joubert.</p><p>The career retrospective book is a natural opportunity to look back on their lives. What advice would they have for their younger selves?</p><p>“Embrace life, be curious and speak out,” said Beverly Joubert. “Speaking out is so important. If you do not speak out, animals — everything around you — will disappear.”</p><p>“I would say to little Derek, ‘Do it all again, exactly the way you did it the first time around,’” said her husband. “You’re going to get dented. You’re going to get bruised. You’re going to get knocked by elephants. You’re going to get run over by buffalo. You’re going to crash a number of airplanes. You’re going to have scorpion stings, snake bites. Don’t change a thing; it’s been a perfect life.”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>“I may change one thing,” he added. “I may say to little Dereck, ‘Avoid buffalo a little more.’”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>EDITOR’S NOTE:  This CNN Travel series may have adjacent ads by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos, in compliance with our policy.</p><p>It’s only taken a few hundred years, but the “Spice Islands” region of eastern Indonesia — now known as the Maluku Islands — is once again attracting attention.</p><p>Virtually off-the-grid for global travelers just two decades ago, the archipelago and its hundreds of islands, along with several surrounding regions, are now on the bucket list of travelers craving new and unusual adventures at sea — all complemented by modern, high-end amenities.</p><p>Ranging from some of the most famous names in luxury hospitality to posh private yachts, there are more than a dozen options to explore the islands that sparked a 16th- and 17th-century “spice rush” for cloves, nutmeg and mace by Portuguese, Dutch and British traders, who could fetch high prices for their flavorsome commodities back in Europe. Most of these cruises also include journeys into neighboring regions like Raja Ampat, which is often referred to as ‘the last paradise on Earth’.</p><p>“The far eastern isles of Indonesia are a true frontier,” says hospitality consultant Jason Friedman, who works with the Kudanil Explorer, a steel-hulled luxury expedition yacht that offers charters for $23,000 per night.</p><p>Filled with astonishing biodiversity, he says they offer a true sense of remoteness that can only be explored by boat.</p><p>“It’s a place where coral reefs explode with color, volcanoes rise from untouched seas, and ancient cultures thrive in isolation,” adds Friedman.</p><p>“Every island tells a different story, with traditions and languages found nowhere else. There’s simply no other place on Earth that feels this wild, authentic and alive.”</p><p>Carolyn Coenen, an Asia-Pacific regional specialist for Wilderness Travel, says the region has become increasingly popular with people “who want to be blown away” by the insane amount of underwater life.</p><p>“Coral reef fishes that you wouldn’t see elsewhere and in large quantities,” she describes. “Just an overload to the senses.”</p><p>Among the big names offering journeys to eastern Indonesia is National Geographic Expeditions, including a two-week Spice Islands/Raja Ampat cruise on the 28-passenger Aqua Blu, which once served as the private yacht of an aristocratic European family. The all-inclusive price, $27,000 per person, includes upscale amenities like Balinese massages, gourmet meals, scuba diving and other water sports, and a National Geographic certified photo instructor to help you snap perfect pictures.</p><p>“With Aqua Blu, we made a deliberate choice to offer an intimate, yacht-style experience rather than a traditional cruise,” says CEO & founder Francesco Galli Zugaro.</p><p>“Most vessels in the region carry larger groups and follow fixed routes. Aqua Blu carries just 30 guests, which allows us to access remote lagoons and lesser visited islands that larger ships simply can’t reach. We offer the perfect combination of scale, flexibility and service.”</p><p>Guests can spend more time in the water or exploring ashore, without the feeling of being on a timetable, he adds.</p><p>“We designed the vessel and the itinerary to feel relaxed but highly curated, everything from the dive operations to the cuisine reflects the same level of attention.”</p><p>Another option is an Indonesian phinisi, a traditional two-masted vessel used for centuries by Spice Islands traders, pirates and fishermen.</p><p>Today’s phinisi are nothing like the boats of old. A prime example is the 14-passenger Lamima, available for charter at a cool $27,000 per night (plus tax). Made of wood, it was constructed by traditional boat builders on a beach in Sulawesi, then outfitted with modern safety features and luxury amenities in Bangkok by a team that included sail riggers from the United Kingdom and engine room specialists from Germany.</p><p>“Because of the way she was built and the way she is run — with an all-Indonesia crew — Lamima has a soul,” says co-owner Dominique Gerardin, who hatched the idea of building the $50 million vessel and saw it through to completion.</p><p>“From the very start we wanted this boat to reflect the heritage of Indonesia.”</p><p>Lamima’s all-inclusive rate includes unlimited massage and beauty treatments at the onboard spa, as well as yoga and meditation sessions, and an array of watersports gear from jet skis, underwater scooters and e-foil boards to surfboards, paddleboards and kayaks.</p><p>Michael Travers of SeaTrek Sailing Adventures, one of the oldest tour companies in the region, says businesses offering boat journeys have had to radically change their products over the years to appeal to high-end travelers with sky-high expectations.</p><p>“We started off more than 30 years ago as a bit of a high-end backpacker operator with shared bathrooms and fan-cooled rooms when there was no other way to see and explore Indonesia,” Travers explains.</p><p>He says that while the islands of Bali and Java were the only destinations that most non-diving travelers were able to easily visit in the 1990s and early 2000s, his company has adapted to cater to those seeking more variety. “But even though en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning and quality gourmet food are now standard on our boats, our original ethos of adventure — and we’re all in this together — is still at the core of what we do.”</p><p>It’s not hard to see why eastern Indonesia is attracting adventurous, well-heeled travelers.</p><p>First and foremost, it offers a blend of sea and land that seems downright unreal. It’s a mosaic of turquoise coves and lush green islands that looks like something generated by computer graphics or artificial intelligence rather than a real-life place on planet Earth.</p><p>Below the surface are pristine coral reefs that swarm with millions of tropical fish and other denizens of the deep. The islands also harbor unique cultures found nowhere else in Indonesia, small but vibrant societies that blend aspects of both Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>Raja Ampat, an archipelago of more than 600 tiny islands off the west coast of West Papua — the Indonesia half of the island of New Guinea — and adjacent to the Spice Islands, draws the most raves (and ship itineraries).</p><p>Declared a Global Geopark by UNESCO in 2023, Raja Ampat is a biodiversity hotspot both above and below the surface. Among its treasures are more than a thousand species of fish and more than 500 types of hard coral.</p><p>Travers of SeaTrek says that multiple factors make Raja Ampat so alluring.</p><p>“The remoteness, the beauty, the resilience and health of the corals, the fact that it’s so hard to get to and consequently all but devoid of tourists. The only way to see it is by boat … it’s just too vast to see otherwise.”</p><p>Both diver training organization PADI and Dive Magazine rank Raja Ampat as one of the world’s best scuba spots. The archipelago also boasts a world record for the most fish species spotted on a single dive: 374 species recorded during a 90-minute dive in 2014.</p><p>The jagged jungle-shrouded karst islands are known for spectacular and colorful birdlife including photogenic species like the red  bird of paradise, Blyth’s hornbill, white-bellied sea eagle and palm cockatoo.</p><p>“The water is crystal clear in Raja Ampat and this is a part of the world where there is very limited coral bleaching,” says Gerardin.</p><p>“So you see incredible marine life if you are diving or snorkeling or even from a paddleboard. You hear a noise, you lift your head and see a big hornbill flying out of the jungle. Suddenly you don’t know where to look — up or down!”</p><p>Many cruises also include visits to Komodo island for an up close glimpse of the world’s largest lizards and bats (flying foxes), or a shore landing on Sumba island to watch local horsemen race along the beach on sturdy little sandalwood ponies.</p><p>Indonesia’s Raja Ampat: ‘The last paradise on Earth’</p><p>For instance, Wilderness Travel offers six seagoing itineraries in eastern Indonesia on three different ships. Their menu ranges from a popular Raja Ampat snorkeling cruise and an expedition-style voyage between Komodo and Bali to more uncommon journeys like swimming with whale sharks in super-remote Cenderawasih Bay in West Papua and a snorkeling expedition to the Wakatobi islands off Sulawesi.</p><p>“We kind of pride ourselves in finding more off-the-beaten-path destinations,” says Coenen.</p><p>“Dropping anchor at night in places and motoring along during the day and not seeing another boat. You may not see anyone else for several days. That’s one of the things that people really love about cruising eastern Indonesia.”</p><p>Travers says that despite the growing popularity of the eastern Indonesian islands, there are still many areas that are virtually untouched by tourism.</p><p>“Like the Kei and Aru island chains in the Arafura Sea between Raja Ampat and Australia.”</p><p>SeaTrek has created a brand new trip for 2026 and 2027 that will visit both of those secluded island chains and the Banda Islands before finishing in Triton Bay in West Papua, where passengers will be able to swim with whale sharks.</p><p>“People come back from our trips feeling changed on many levels,” says Travers. “At least that’s our aim.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>They talked real estate, debated complicated zoning code, and mulled over how to get a utility giant to bring down electricity rates.</p><p>Then, they talked about what it takes to build housing in America’s largest city and how the health of the five boroughs hinges on the streets being safe.</p><p>Those were some of the topics New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump covered during a nearly hourlong meeting at the White House last week.</p><p>Mamdani, who arrived in Washington, DC, for sit-down Friday, made his way through the West Wing of the White House alongside three top aides, senior adviser Morris Katz, press secretary Dora Pekec and his chief of staff, Elle Bisgaard-Church, according to a person familiar with the meeting.</p><p>When it was finally time to enter the Oval, only Bisgaard-Church was invited. Inside was Trump and his own chief of staff, Susie Wiles.</p><p>“Our conversation focused on New York City, and I think that is a point of shared focus,” Mamdani told CNN on Sunday. “A point of shared admiration for the city that we both call home, and a city that is in danger of becoming a museum where working people once were.”</p><p>The meeting then turned into a tour, with Trump taking Mamdani into the Cabinet Room, which overlooks a now paved-over Rose Garden. The room is also home to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidential portrait. Mamdani and Trump posed in front of the painting; Trump flashed a smile and posed with his signature thumbs-up. Mamdani clasped his hands and offered a faint smile yielding a new image — three men from New York who have shaken politics in their own ways.</p><p>“It was a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani, the new Mayor of New York City!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday, sharing photos of the two after the meeting.</p><p>When the doors opened to allow cameras into the room, Trump heaped praise on Mamdani, suggesting he and the man he often falsely referred to as a “communist” actually had quite a bit in common.</p><p>“Some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have,” Trump said while sitting at his desk as Mamdani stood beside him. “We agree on a lot more than I would’ve thought.”</p><p>It was a surprisingly positive ending to a high-stakes meeting between two diametrically opposed politicians who have spent several months trading barbs.</p><p>“I can only take one meeting at a time, one conversation at a time,” Mamdani told CNN on Sunday. “All I hoped to do in that conversation was to establish a working relationship and to have a productive meeting that focused on the work itself, focused on the people that many of the two of us know, and people across these five boroughs that we never met.”</p><p>Mamdani told CNN he spoke to Trump about immigration during their meeting — with the looming question of whether the president will ramp up his immigration crackdown in New York, like he has in some other blue cities.</p><p>But even without that, the presence of federal officers and enforcement action is being felt across the city’s immigrant communities.</p><p>Advocates have reported an uptick in apprehensions and targeted operations. In response, immigrant rights organizations have started to organize, distributing “know your rights” pamphlets and training citizen patrols to spot Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and alert people who may be at risk.</p><p>While Mamdani would not say whether Trump agreed to not increase immigration enforcement in the city, he said he told the president New York City law enforcement is willing to collaborate with the federal government as long as it stays within the existing parameters. New York’s “sanctuary city” rules say local law enforcement are only required to collaborate with federal agencies on immigration enforcement only when people convicted of violent or serious crimes are involved.</p><p>“The concern comes from beyond those crimes,” Mamdani said. “The many New Yorkers who are being arrested, they’re being detained, they’re being deported for the crime of showing up to a regular court appearance at 26 Federal Plaza for the crime of simply being present in New York City.”</p><p>Trump has previously said he did not believe immigration action had gone far enough when he was asked about officers violently detaining people inside courtrooms and on city streets. On Saturday, the president appeared to back down from his previous threats to send federal reinforcements into New York City, telling reporters he would do so only if the city needs it.</p><p>Mamdani would not tell CNN on Sunday whether the president agreed with him on how to handle immigration enforcement in the city.</p><p>“I’ll let the president speak for himself, but I did make very clear that our focus comes back to public safety,” Mamdani said. “Knowing that there may be disagreements between the president and myself, and there will continue to be, and I will always make the case for each and every person that calls this city home.”</p><p>Mamdani spent the weekend in the capital after his meeting. On Friday evening, Mamdani, a fierce critic of the Israeli government, stopped at a Palestinian restaurant in Virginia for dinner.</p><p>Back in New York City on Sunday, Mamdani spoke to the congregation at Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church in the Bronx.</p><p>“My responsibility is to work,” Mamdani told the crowd. “And to do that work means to work with anyone, means to work with those who were opposed to my candidacy, work with those who belong to a different party, work with those with whom I hold deep disagreements.”</p><p>The comments came after Mamdani earlier in the day doubled down on his attacks against Trump, despite the friendly meeting.</p><p>On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the mayor-elect was asked to clarify whether he believes Trump is fascist. During the Friday meeting, Trump cut him off, jokingly telling Mamdani it was “OK” to call him one when he was asked the same question by a reporter.</p><p>“Everything I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” Mamdani responded on Sunday. “I said yes, and that’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>EDITOR’S NOTE:  This story contains disturbing images.</p><p>In the chaotic aftermath of Tanzania’s disputed presidential election last month, police and gun-wielding men on patrol shot at groups of protesters, many of whom appeared unarmed or were holding only rocks and sticks, a CNN investigation has found.</p><p>Geolocated videos from the scenes, audio forensic analysis of the shots fired and first-hand accounts from witnesses and victims document the brutality unleashed on young demonstrators following the re-election of President Samia Suluhu Hassan – who claimed she won with 98% of the vote on October 29 after barring her chief rivals from the presidential race.</p><p>Videos verified by CNN also support witness reports about the deadly toll of the post-election crackdown, showing morgues overflowing with scores of bodies.</p><p>Additionally, satellite images and videos show recently disturbed soil consistent with reports of mass graves in the Kondo cemetery, north of the East African country’s main city of Dar es Salaam. Two human rights groups and witnesses interviewed by CNN say the bodies of protesters killed in the past few weeks have been buried there.</p><p>After the election, authorities imposed a curfew and an internet blackout as people gathered in the streets to contest the exclusion of Hassan’s rivals from the polls. The main opposition party leader, Tundu Lissu, has been in custody since April, charged with treason.</p><p>When internet connectivity was partially restored a week later, police barred the sharing of photos and videos “that cause panic.” Government officials initially denied any killings of protesters had occurred. Last week, however, the president acknowledged there had been some casualties, but she did not release any figures.</p><p>Hassan on Thursday launched a commission to investigate the unrest, but also suggested that protesters were paid.</p><p>In a press conference Sunday, Tanzania’s government spokesperson Gerson Msigwa called the investigation a “biased report” intended to “mislead and incite” accusing CNN of not giving Tanzanian authorities opportunity to respond. CNN sent detailed questions to Msigwa, the police and the country’s ministry of health, but did not receive a response.</p><p>“If they want to find us, we’re available. We’ll answer their questions. We’re not blocking them from doing their job. But they should do it professionally and fairly,” Msigwa said. The commission of inquiry is in process, he added.</p><p>The crackdown on protesters has marred the reputation of Tanzania as a stable democracy that attracts millions of tourists every year.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Office, based on information from multiple sources in the country, suggested hundreds of protesters and other civilians were killed, with an unknown number injured or detained.</p><p>With the help of open-source investigator Benjamin Strick, CNN reviewed dozens of videos and images of civilians lying dead from gunshot wounds, as well as images of bodies overflowing morgues at the Sekou-Toure Regional Referral Hospital in Mwanza and the Mwananyamala Hospital in Dar es Salaam.</p><p>In Mwanza, photos and videos geolocated by CNN outside the hospital show at least 10 bodies piled up on a stretcher.</p><p>One doctor, who treated victims of gunshot wounds over the course of four days there and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the dead were brought to the morgue by police “until it was full.” After that, he said, they “piled” the bodies outside the hospital.</p><p>Many victims, both dead and injured, were young men, the doctor said. “All had sustained gunshot wounds on different parts of the body. Especially the head, abdomen, chest, lower limbs. Badly wounded patients with varying degrees of consciousness,” he told CNN.</p><p>In Dar es Salaam, a video geolocated by CNN at the morgue of Mwananyamala Hospital shows dozens of bodies covering the floor, piled up on top of each other. Tanzania’s Ministry of Health denied the authenticity of the footage in a statement on social media. The ministry did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.</p><p>A woman, who requested anonymity out of concern for her safety, told CNN she saw the video from the morgue and recognized the body of her brother, who was killed during the protests on the balcony of his own home. “We’ve been looking for his body at every mortuary in Dar es Salaam since 1st November, but he was not there,” she told CNN.</p><p>According to witnesses, demonstrations broke out shortly after polls opened on October 29 and continued for a few days after in some locations. In one violent encounter analyzed by CNN, Tanzanian police in the city of Arusha fatally shot two protesters who appeared to be no threat to them – a pregnant woman who was shot in the back while running away, and a young man who was shot in the head.</p><p>At 3:27 p.m. the day of the election, a group of young men who were gathered at an intersection, were confronted by about 10 armed police officers. One protester appears to be seen throwing a rock at them.</p><p>Two minutes later, the scene becomes frantic, according to a video circulating on social media which Strick first geolocated. CNN obtained the original footage and confirmed his findings by analyzing its metadata.</p><p>In the video, demonstrators are seen running down the road amid bursts of gunfire. One woman wearing a lavender top and a hat, holding a stick and a rock, is fatally shot in the back as she’s running with other protesters. She drops to the ground, blood coming out of her blouse. Other demonstrators attempt unsuccessfully to help the woman to her feet and administer aid.</p><p>In another video, a woman can be heard asking the mortally injured woman  to wake up. The protesters, in distress, can be heard calling for help.</p><p>A forensic analysis of the scene shows that the woman was shot from behind: a hole in the blouse, the entry point of the bullet, can be seen shortly after a gunshot is heard. Moments later, the woman drops the stick and stone, and collapses.</p><p>Sources close to her family confirmed to CNN that the woman was three months pregnant, leaving behind a husband and two children.</p><p>Rob Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined audio extracted from the original video of the shooting.</p><p>Based on the time gap between the “crack” sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet and the “boom” of the muzzle blast, Maher established the distance between the firearm and microphone of the device that filmed the video to be about 112 meters (367 feet).</p><p>A few minutes later, a video filmed from the other side of the road shows a protester dressed in black walking towards the police position at the top of the road. Another protester throws a rock, a shot rings out and a different man with a red shirt is seen collapsing, with a visible head injury. The video was first geolocated by Strick, the open-source investigator, and verified by CNN.</p><p>Another video of the encounter shows the man lying in a pool of blood, still breathing. “Oh my God, this is our Tanzania,” repeats the person filming, along with a Muslim prayer. The man was visible in earlier footage, holding a rock, but he didn’t appear to have anything in his hands when he was shot and killed.</p><p>The victim was at least 95 meters away from police at the time he was shot, according to an audio analysis by Maher. Both this distance and the one calculated in the video of the shooting of the pregnant woman correspond to the visible location of police at the top of the road, according to CNN’s analysis.</p><p>An eyewitness to both shootings told CNN the Arusha protest had started peacefully until police started firing at them. The witness saw the pregnant woman being shot in front of her.</p><p>“I tried to call for help from others to pull her (the pregnant woman) aside because she was still breathing but shots kept getting fired and it hit one young man on the head. It was the most inhumane thing ever,” the witness said. “Someone’s mother died while I and others watched.”</p><p>In other parts of the country, videos have surfaced on social media of security officers and of armed men in plain clothes – who locals suspect are police – pursuing protesters and opening fire on them.

{"details":"<p>Developers with political ties to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser stand to collect millions of dollars more than housing experts say is normal for an affordable housing project.</p><p>A short drive from the soon-to-be redeveloped RFK Stadium site in Southeast Washington, a red-brick building known as the Ethel has been lauded by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) as the kind of development needed to solve an affordable housing crisis in one of the most expensive regions in the country.</p><p>All 100 one-bedroom units come with social services for the formerly homeless people who live there, mostly rent-free — a response to the intense needs in a city where tent encampments have been common.</p><p>But it’s not only residents who have benefited.</p><p>The building’s developers are collecting millions of dollars more than housing finance experts say would normally go to developers for such a project — money flowing from a cascade of government subsidies approved by city officials, a Washington Post investigation found.</p><p>The Post’s findings show that, thanks to the near-free land and tens of millions of dollars in other subsidies, the developers stand to collect more than $13 million in payouts during the building’s first 15 years of operation if their projections hold. The payments come on top of an $8.5 million developer fee, also funded through subsidies, that experts say should alone have compensated them for undertaking the project.</p><p>“Bluntly, the taxpayers of D.C. are being screwed by this,” said Kirk McClure, a professor emeritus for the public affairs school at the University of Kansas and a former loan underwriter for the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. He and two other experts who reviewed the financial records at The Post’s request questioned whether the District has adequate guardrails to prevent overpaying developers.</p><p>The partnership responsible for developing the Ethel is led by Chris Donatelli, CEO of a Bethesda-based real estate development company, and Bryan “Scottie” Irving, founder of D.C.-based Blue Skye Development. Both men are longtime Bowser campaign supporters, and both have repeatedly been among developers who received free or heavily discounted land from the District in return for promises to build affordable housing.</p><p>Bowser appointed Irving to the board of the D.C. Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA), a local government entity responsible for ensuring that such projects do not receive more funding than they need and that developers are not overcompensated.</p><p>Nina Albert, who began as deputy mayor for planning and economic development two years after the Ethel was financed, said that she and her staff put “fresh eyes” on the deal after questions from The Post and that they determined “unequivocally that the developer was not unduly enriched.” She maintained that the project came “at no cost to taxpayers” and “did not include any D.C. money.” Records show the development budget relied on a city loan to be repaid through tens of millions of dollars in revenue from the locally funded rental vouchers, the near-free land and $27 million in forgone federal tax revenue to provide low-income housing tax credits.</p><p>Albert said in a statement that the Ethel is “a crucial lifeline to at-risk families, offering community services and amenities to teach residents life skills, helping them reenter the workforce, or otherwise putting them on a path to long-term growth and stability.”</p><p>Donatelli did not respond to requests for comment. His attorney, Paul E. Alpuche, declined to comment. Irving also declined to comment.</p><p>After the Ethel was financed, the mayor’s office tapped Donatelli and Irving to develop five more city-owned parcels in Hill East, though a recent court order has called into question whether Donatelli will remain involved. The area is ripe for investment after the D.C. Council approved a $3.7 billion deal for a new Washington Commanders stadium complex.</p><p>When Bowser first ran for mayor in 2014, Donatelli and Irving were part of the “Green Team” of civic leaders and donors who backed her. The pair, their families and companies controlled by them combined to contribute about $25,000 to the campaign. Donatelli celebrated at Bowser’s primary election party, wearing a green “MURIEL FOR MAYOR” T-shirt.</p><p>iClick these iconsto see documents and more detailed information.</p><p>City officials had long envisioned buildings on the land as a beachhead for further redevelopment in Hill East, an area of modest houses between the Capitol Hill neighborhood and the Anacostia River that has long been home to public facilities, including the now-demolished D.C.

That allowed the Ethel to qualify for the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.</p><p>Then the city added another subsidy to the Ethel, pledging 20 years of locally funded rental vouchers for each of the building’s 100 units. The tenants put 30 percent of their income toward rent, but that contribution is from a few hundred dollars to nothing for most, leaving the city to pay the bulk. The District agreed to allow the building to collect $2,648 per month for each unit — several hundred dollars above the market rate, according to an appraisal report.</p><p>The project had gone from cash-poor — as most affordable housing developments are — to bursting with subsidies.</p><p>The land contribution also gave the developers a parcel on which they have built a second apartment building, the Park Kennedy, which carries a far lower affordable housing burden — only 31 of 262 units. The parcel of land, not including the building that sits on it, is assessed on the tax rolls at $9.8 million.</p><p>The Ethel’s financial plan began coming together in early 2021. So did a highly unusual part of the deal, according to records The Post obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.</p><p>The land sale and accompanying loan were authorized by John Falcicchio, the mayor’s then chief of staff and then deputy mayor for planning and economic development. Ben Soto, Bowser’s former longtime campaign treasurer, served as trustee for the loan through Premium Title & Escrow, a company he runs that handled the development’s financial closing.</p><p>Soto said in a phone message that the Ethel’s financing appeared ordinary, and that it is common for someone who handles a closing to serve as trustee for a related loan. Falcicchio did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>In August 2021, the project’s financing went before DCHFA’s board. Irving did not attend the meeting. The other members signed off unanimously.</p><p>A sale of such land as part of a complex transaction involving federal tax credits is not in itself unusual, the three experts who reviewed the deal told The Post. But a setup under which payments for land essentially gifted by the government go to for-profit developers — on top of a large developer fee — is unheard of, the experts said. A Post review of dozens of tax-credit projects in the District found no other similar case. What’s more common is a local government being repaid for donated land if a project does well financially.</p><p>Michael Diamond, a Georgetown University law professor who focuses on housing and economic development, said there’s a key unanswered question in the transaction: What did the developers do to earn the $7.1 million in payments?</p><p>“If the answer is nothing, then you have a siphoning situation,” he said, meaning an inappropriate benefit.</p><p>The mayor’s office offered several explanations for the land transaction. It said the arrangement allowed the project to qualify for a larger mortgage, reduced tax liabilities and rewarded the developers for readying the land for development. The experts who reviewed the deal at The Post’s request said none of those explanations resolved their questions.</p><p>But Albert acknowledged that the project budget reimbursed the developers for their expenses during the pre-construction phase.</p><p>McClure, the University of Kansas professor, said the developer fee alone should have compensated for the risk of fronting those expenses. “If the land rose in value, then God bless the taxpayers of the District of Columbia — they should have enjoyed that increase in value,” he said. “That [the developer] puts some money up front, that’s why he gets $8 million in developers fees. We expect him to have to put millions of dollars into this deal.”</p><p>Christopher Donald, DCHFA’s executive director, and his staffers worked with Donatelli to iron out the Ethel’s financial details, records show.</p><p>Budgets the city relied on ahead of the Ethel’s construction indicated the higher amount was not needed, and federal law specifies that a project cannot collect more tax credits than necessary for its financial feasibility — a determination DCHFA is required to make.</p><p>Two weeks later, as the project’s financial closing drew near, a representative of Donatelli sent DCHFA updated budgets that again showed the project fully funded without the higher amount. Still, Donald signed a document supporting the boosted figure, saying it was necessary to ensure “the financial feasibility of the Project.”</p><p>After the building opened in 2023, when Donatelli claimed the higher figure, it generated an extra $5.2 million in cash for the development from PNC Bank, records show, though the project’s cost had barely changed.</p><p>Donald declined to be interviewed. DCHFA’s spokeswoman, Yolanda McCutchen, did not answer questions about why the agency agreed to the higher tax credit figure, saying in an email that it “was allowable in accordance with federal regulations.” She said Donald’s memo to the board “contained a clerical error,” which was corrected in the second document he signed. She did not say why the budgets that Donatelli’s representative circulated just ahead of the project’s financial closing also indicated the development was fully funded without the tax-credit boost.</p><p>The higher amount “requires an explanation,” said William Pavão, a former executive director of the California agency that administers federal low-income housing tax credits for that state. “Why are they permitting that?”</p><p>As the project’s financing came together, ERFSC’s then-executive director, Mae Best, signed a request for the property tax exemption for the Ethel, saying it was indirectly controlled by the nonprofit. The D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) then certified that the project qualified.</p><p>Diamond, the Georgetown law professor, said the agreement gives “absolutely no control, none” to ERFSC. The nonprofit “has at best an input, collaborative kind of role, not a controlling role,” he said.</p><p>Best told The Post that her organization was “just one of the community partners” in the development. “We are not the developer,” she said, referring questions to Donatelli.</p><p>When asked in September 2024 to more fully describe ERFSC’s role, Best declined to comment, citing advice from ERFSC’s lawyer. She retired at the end of that month. ERFSC’s CEO, Rahman Branch, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>DHCD spokesman Timothy Wilson said the tax relief certification was valid, without addressing the nonprofit’s lack of control.</p><p>The nearly $500,000 annual tax break results in further projected extra cash, enabling more money to go to the developers faster.</p><p>The Ethel cost nearly $800,000 per one-bedroom unit to develop, records show, making it the most expensive project on a per-unit basis that DCHFA had financed by 2021, when the deal closed.</p><p>Next door, the same developers built the Park Kennedy, for mostly market-rate tenants, for about $360,000 per unit, records show.</p><p>City officials have long viewed the Ethel and Park Kennedy as catalysts for upcoming development along the Anacostia waterfront, an area newly energized by the planned Commanders stadium.</p><p>Last year, Donatelli and Irving’s proposal for two more buildings on city land there won zoning approval. In September, a court overseeing Donatelli’s divorce found he had not paid what he owes under a postnuptial agreement. The court gave his ex-wife some authority over the company he and Irving set up for the next phase of development, so that she can arrange for the sale of his 50 percent stake in it.</p><p>Longtime Bowser critic Bill Slover, a former D.C. Housing Authority board member who believes the mayor’s development moves have unreasonably benefited developers, called the Ethel an “egregious giveaway under the guise of affordable housing.” When the project was up for review, he declined to vote on the city’s plan to allocate rental vouchers for use by the Ethel.</p><p>When the voucher question reached the D.C. Council in late 2019, Elissa Silverman, an at-large member at the time, joined the unanimous vote but only after rebuking the mayor’s office, which she said had not been forthcoming about the building’s subsidies.</p><p>The worthiness of the project, a visibly incensed Silverman, an independent, said on the dais before the vote, “doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t have the ability to question the subsidy to developers.”</p><p>“Both the mayor and her selected group of developers think that once you wave the magic wand of affordable housing, the debate’s over,” Silverman told The Post. “That’s sort of how the council deals with it, too. It’s like, ‘Oh, it’s affordable. We shouldn’t question it.’”</p>","headline":"How D.C. developers made big money on a taxpayer-funded housing project","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/interactive/2025/dc-bowser-housing-homeless/","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T11:00:00.000Z"}

In Bodrum town on the southern shore, traditional gulet sailing boats fill the marina, ready to take tourists on cruises.</p><p>Today, it’s where Istanbul’s elite come to relax, party, or be pampered, and where international visitors travel for sunshine and sea.</p><p>They are by no means the first people of means to have left their mark here. From the Leleges to the Mycenaeans, from the Romans to the Byzantines, many civilizations have risen and fallen on the peninsula, leaving archaeological treasures in their wake.</p><p>The greatest of all, built around 350 BCE on a hilltop overlooking what is now Bodrum town, was the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was all the more remarkable because it was created as the result of an incestuous marriage.</p><p>Very little remains of the mausoleum today. Today, the biggest historical structure is Bodrum Castle, a huge Gothic fortress overlooking the marina. The region’s importance as a tourism hub is just the latest chapter in its long history of strategic significance.</p><p>“It’s like a gateway between East and West,” says Orhan Can, a guide with Bodrum Tour, pointing out that even today Istanbul is the best connected airport in the world. Turkey “has always been a place for business.”</p><p>The Mausoleum’s occupants, more than two millennia ago, were Mausolus and his sister-wife Artemesia II, members of the Hectamnod dynasty which ruled over the region then known as Caria between 395 and 366 BCE.</p><p>Mausolus and Artemisia made Halicarnassus — now Bodrum — the capital of Caria, boosting its population and initiating many building projects, the most extravagant being their tomb. After Mausolus’s death in 353 BCE, Artemisia oversaw its construction, a temple-like structure designed by the finest Greek architects and sculptors, combining Greek, Egyptian, and Lycian styles.</p><p>Decorated with friezes of battle scenes and some 400 freestanding sculptures, its base was more than 400 feet in circumference. It was topped by a pyramid upon which rode a four-horse chariot containing statues of the departed couple.</p><p>Artemisia held a grand funeral for her husband, with games and ceremonies. “After Mausolus died, they cremated him,” says Can. Legend has it that Artemesia, the grieving sister-widow, drank her husband’s ashes mixed with wine, which would later become a popular subject for Renaissance painters in the Western world.</p><p>She succeeded him as leader, becoming a noted naval commander, but outlived him by just two years. Legend has it that her early death was “because she was so sad,” says Can.</p><p>A series of earthquakes from the 12th to 15th century led to the monument’s collapse. At Bodrum Mausoleum Museum, visitors to the archaeological park look down, not up, into the sunken foundations excavated by British archaeologist Charles Newton in the 19th century. Broken pieces of the 36 columns that once sat under the tomb’s pyramid are scattered all around, while steps lead down to Mausolus and Artemesia’s burial chamber. The mausoleum’s drainage system has also survived.</p><p>Newton transported the prize pieces to the British Museum in London, but some original friezes and recently discovered architectural fragments are on display in the park’s small museum.</p><p>However, surviving relics from the Halicarnassus era, and from the mausoleum itself, are still found throughout Bodrum and as far as 2,000 miles beyond.</p><p>Together, these archaeological puzzle pieces build a picture of life, and death, in one of antiquity’s most thriving harbor cities. Here’s how to follow the treasure trail.</p><p>Bodrum’s horseshoe-shaped Antique Theater, built during Mausolus’s reign and then expanded 200 years later during the Roman era, is a 20-minute walk uphill from the mausoleum site.</p><p>The theater looks out over the bay towards Bodrum Castle, the construction of which was fortified in the 15th century with marble columns and green volcanic stone from the ruins of the mausoleum.</p><p>At its peak, up to 10,000 people could be seated here to view everything from theatrical plays, to gladiator battles, to wild animal fights.</p><p>Entertainment today is more sedate. Concerts and cultural events are still held here, to audiences of nearly 4,000, but on the day CNN visits we share this space with just a well-behaved school group and one selfie-taking couple.</p><p>Mount Nemrut: Where colossal stone gods guard a 2,000-year-old mystery</p><p>Mausolus “built a lot of things back in those days,” says Can. “He made Caria more Greek. He started making people worship Greek gods and goddesses. He started to build temples for them.”</p><p>His expensive projects earned him a reputation as a tyrant, with finds raised through taxes, including one reputedly on Lycian men’s hair.</p><p>“He said to them, ‘give me your long hair, or you pay me tax,’” explains Can. “But he wasn’t wasting the hair. He was using them for the wigs of aristocrat Persians.”</p><p>One of these projects was building defensive walls around the city. Two gates guarded the east and the west of Halicarnassus, with the remains of the western Myndos Gate still standing on a hillside in the Eskiçeşme neighborhood, within walking distance of the theater.</p><p>The original height of the monumental towers of andesite stone is not known, but their sturdy bases have stood for close to 2,400 years. There is also a fourth-century necropolis nearby with Roman and Hellenistic vaulted tombs.</p><p>One of the most poignant parts of the site is the 23-feet-wide, eight-feet-deep moat which, during the Siege of Halicarnassus in 334 BCE, for some time held off the forces of Alexander the Great. Many soldiers lost their lives by falling into the moat or being trampled upon, while the collapse of an overloaded bridge also resulted in many casualties.</p><p>Back down on the waterfront, Bodrum Castle, an imposing example of Gothic architecture with Ottoman additions, dominates the modern town and also offers the city’s best views over the bay. It’s been on the UNESCO Tentative List of World Heritage sites since 2016.</p><p>It was built by the Knights of Saint John, who ruled over Bodrum throughout the 15th century. Not only were parts of Mausolus’s tomb used in the castle’s construction, but the castle is on the same promontory regarded to be the likely site of Mausolus’s palace.</p><p>For your 20-euro entrance fee, it’s a multiple-whammy historical experience. As well as being home to the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, it has a wealth of artifacts from the many civilizations that have called this corner of the world home. Its display related to the late Bronze Age Mycenaean people is particularly impressive.</p><p>The ancient monastery hanging from the side of a cliff</p><p>To see the remains of a woman who was likely the little sister of Mausoleus and Artemesia, head to the Carian Princess exhibit in the museum’s upper levels.</p><p>A stone sarcophagus was found in 1989 at a necropolis site in the Yokuşbaşı neighborhood of Bodrum containing a well-preserved skeleton of a high-born woman, along with a gold crown and jewels. She is believed to be Ada, fifth ruler of the Hecatomnid dynasty. Her remains are on display in the museum, along with her belongings and a full-size model based on a facial reconstruction of her skull.</p><p>Hecatomnus was Caria’s first indigenous satrap — the term for regional governors in the Persian empire — and ruled from 395 to 377 BCE. Of his five children, two sets of siblings married each other, with the brother-sister couple Idrieus and Ada succeeding Mausoleus and Artemesia.</p><p>Neither couple had children, so the marriages may have been symbolic. Sibling marriage was not at all common at this time, with incest generally considered taboo.</p><p>“I think back in those days, for royal people, it was okay to do anything they want to do,” says Can. The general population “were accepting whatever they did.”</p><p>Intermarriage between the siblings strengthened the dynasty by keeping the bloodline in the family. It also mirrored the mythology of the Greek gods, such as the union of king Zeus and his queen and sister-wife Hera.</p><p>Ada’s unusual high-status connections don’t end with the marriage to her brother Idrieus. She ruled over Caria twice, with reigns before and after the Siege of Halicarnassus, having being reinstated to power by her adopted son, Alexander the Great.</p><p>The shoreline around Bodrum is lined with beachside restaurants, beaches and bars, but it’s still possible to leave the crowds behind and ascend into the quiet forests of its mountainous interior. Here, the landscape is much as it was in ancient times.</p><p>Hidden high on a hilltop and visited by few, just a few miles’ hike from Bodrum town center, is the ancient city of Pedasa, which dates as far back as the 12th century BCE. In the fourth century, Mausolus ruled that the inhabitants of Pedasa and other smaller settlements be relocated to Halicarnassus, to boost the population of the newly established capital.</p><p>Pedasa is a stop on the 510-mile Carian Trail, a long-distance hiking route around the region that visits beaches, hills, villages and archaeological wonders. “In Turkey, there are so many ruins, and there’s so many civilizations, and we wanted to focus on the Carian features,” Altay Özcan, co-founder of the trail, tells CNN. Despite the area’s popularity with tourists, it’s still possible for visitors to get “a stretch of nature to yourself,” he says.</p><p>Pedasa is a “hidden gem,” says Can, as is Labraunda, “a sanctuary of Zeus. It’s on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere and it’s like a little Machu Picchu. Idrieus, the brother of Mausolus, built most of it.”</p><p>Shortly before his death of unknown causes, Mausolus survived an assassination attempt during a royal procession at Labraunda during an annual festival. The ruins are about an hour’s drive from Bodrum, on the other side of Bodrum-Milas Airport.</p><p>What really happens inside a Turkish bath</p><p>It’s hard to go far in Turkey without tripping over an archaeological treasure, but there are still plenty more wonders hidden underground.</p><p>Gümüşlük is a pretty fishing village on the Bodrum Peninsula’s western coast, known for its seaside restaurants. At low tide, you can wade out from the harborside mermaid restaurant along the “King’s Road,” an ancient path that may date back 3,500 years to the Mycenaean era. It leads to a grassy mound known as Rabbit Island, the visible tip of what was once the city of Myndos, established by the Lelegian civilization some 4,000 years ago.</p><p>The island is fenced off due to uncompleted excavation work, but the city itself is thought to extend underground through Gümüşlük itself.</p><p>Two lion sculptures from the mausoleum now stand at the entrance of the British Museum’s Front Hall in London. The main mausoleum exhibit is in the museum’s Room 21, with other pieces in Rooms 77 and 81.</p><p>The walls are a gentle gray-blue, like the sea on a winter’s day, and the sand-colored tiles underfoot complement the marble statues and the slab friezes that line the room.</p><p>A colossal statue of a horse, from the chariot group which crowned the tomb, stands at the top of the staircase with head bowed and muscles flaring.</p><p>The friezes depict battles between Greeks and Amazons and Greek and Centaurs. In the Amazon frieze, a female warrior prepares to strike a kneeling Greek, while another Amazon appears to cry out for mercy as a caped Greek pulls her back by the hair.</p><p>In the center of the room are the two statues traditionally identified as Artemesia and Mausolus, both well over eight feet tall. Their poses are relaxed, their tunics and gathered mantles draped over their chest and thighs to their sandaled feet.</p><p>Artemesia’s face is shattered stone, but above it remains her hairstyle of three rolls of curls under a fitted cap. Mausolus’s head, with its wavy hair reaching shoulders some three feet wide, is largely intact. Under arched brows in a full, handsome face, his deep-set eyes gaze imperiously, thoughtfully, the hint of an Elvis pout curling at his lips.</p><p>Two-thousand miles from home, more than 2,000 years from their place in history, these effigies of brother and sister, of husband and wife, look blindly down on the stream of visitors in a future they could never have imagined.</p><p>The tomb which held them, the robust structure from which they hoped to stand forever over Bodrum and the blue Aegean, was lost centuries ago to the crashing waves of nature, which wash over all.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy, revealed on Saturday she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, with a doctor telling her she has less than a year to live.</p><p>In an essay in The New Yorker, the 35-year-old wrote that she was diagnosed last year with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation known as Inversion 3, a genetic anomaly found in less than 2% of AML cases.</p><p>Doctors discovered the cancer shortly after Schlossberg gave birth to her daughter in May 2024.</p><p>“I did not — could not — believe that they were talking about me,” Schlossberg wrote. “I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn’t sick. I didn’t feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”</p><p>In the essay, Schlossberg documents the grueling treatment process, which included several rounds of chemotherapy, two bone-marrow transplants and participation in two clinical trials. Schlossberg said she was also diagnosed with a form of Epstein-Barr virus in September, which “blasted my kidneys,” and had to learn to walk again.</p><p>“During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,” she wrote.</p><p>Schlossberg, an environmental journalist, is the second daughter of former US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and designer Edwin Schlossberg. Tatiana Schlossberg and her husband, George Moran, have a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter.</p><p>Schlossberg said her siblings — Rose, a filmmaker, and Jack, who earlier this month announced a run for Congress — have been helping raise her children and “have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered, trying not to show their pain and sadness in order to protect me from it.”</p><p>Schlossberg described going through treatment as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after “running for President as an Independent, but mostly as an embarrassment to me and the rest of my immediate family.”</p><p>She said the doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where she was treated, didn’t know whether they would be affected after the Trump administration stripped Columbia University of federal funding. “Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. The university later agreed a deal with the Trump administration to restore the funding.</p><p>Schlossberg said she regrets adding to her family’s history of tragedy, which includes John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and the assassination of her great-uncle, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968.</p><p>“For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,” she writes. “Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family’s life, and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>New Yorkers know better than to be overly positive.</p><p>A day after Zohran Mamdani got a surprisingly warm reception at the White House from President Donald Trump, who has spent the last few months deriding the New York City mayor-elect as a “lunatic” and falsely labeling him a communist, New Yorkers told CNN they were cautiously optimistic and slightly impressed.</p><p>“I really don’t like the guy, but I’m glad that he was able to go in there and do a good job with the president,” John Lani told CNN Saturday following a mid-morning run in Central Park. “Maybe we’ll get some funding, we won’t shut down congestion pricing. Maybe we’ll get some stuff for the subway, we’ll see what it does for the state.”</p><p>Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist who previously served three terms in the New York State Assembly, cruised to victory earlier this month, winning every borough in the city except for Staten Island, a known Republican enclave.</p><p>Near Central Park, along the bustle of one of Manhattan’s most congested intersections, New Yorkers praised Mamdani’s handling of his televised press engagement with the president, even if they remain skeptical about how he will ultimately perform once he takes office on January 1.</p><p>Voter data analysis published by The Center for Urban Research at CUNY’s Graduate Center shows the area near Central Park, home to Columbus Circle and the Trump International Hotel, favored former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran against Mamdani as an independent.</p><p>“I hope everyone’s very successful. I didn’t support either party,” said a voter who did not want to share their name.</p><p>Trump and Mamdani’s relationship will prove pivotal for several key issues in New York City.</p><p>There is the question of whether Trump will ramp up immigration enforcement and deploy federal forces, like he has in some other blue cities. There are major infrastructure projects that depend on federal funding, and the vast majority of Mamdani’s proposals — like making city buses fast and free, providing free universal childcare and raising taxes on the wealthy — will depend on funding from the state, which is also dependent on federal funds.</p><p>After watching news coverage of the meeting, Sherry and Steve Cohen, who live in Manhattan, said they wanted to give Mamdani a chance.</p><p>“I’d like to think that Mamdani is being smart enough to play Trump and praise the man because he needs things for New York,” Steve Cohen said. “Unfortunately, this is what you have to do. You have to bow down, praise him, and walk out and wash your hands after.”</p><p>Trump, who grew up in Queens and made his name and fortune in Manhattan, remains focused on New York City despite his lack of popularity there. Trump, who conceded Friday he would have loved to be mayor of his hometown, struck an agreeable tone, saying he wanted to help the city instead of hurt it.</p><p>Already, there were signs that Mamdani’s approach might be working, at least for now.</p><p>Trump suggested Saturday New York City is not a priority for deploying National Guard troops.</p><p>“Right now, other places need it more,” Trump told reporters. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it.”</p><p>Shelly Payson, who is supportive of Mamdani, said she thought Mamdani had a strategy going into the meeting that worked.</p><p>“I think that Trump continues to be the most transactional president we’ve ever had, and if people are smart they find a way to give him something which may be meaningless, but it’s important to him and then he loves you and rolls out the red carpet,” Payson said.</p><p>CNN’s Kit Maher contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene denied a report that her decision to resign from Congress in January is driven by a desire to enter the 2028 presidential race.</p><p>“I’m not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,” she wrote in a lengthy X post on Sunday.</p><p>The Georgia Republican announced on Friday that she won’t seek reelection and will leave her seat in January, amid a public falling out with her longtime ally President Donald Trump. She had said for weeks Trump is too focused on foreign policy and not doing enough with his domestic agenda. Greene also became among the most vocal critics of the president’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.</p><p>Trump, in turn, called Greene a “traitor” and said he’d support a GOP challenge to her House seat next year.</p><p>It comes as Greene has pivoted away from the Republican Party more broadly recently, criticizing the GOP on a number of fronts, including the party’s handling of the government shutdown.</p><p>Greene included in her Sunday post a screenshot of a TIME report from Saturday that said she has privately told allies that she has considered running for president in 2028. The TIME article said House Republicans familiar with Greene’s thinking suspect her potential candidacy could be “capable of siphoning off votes from the GOP nominee, positioning her to leverage that political capital into a possible role within a future Republican administration.”</p><p>Greene wrote in her Sunday post the article is “a complete lie and they made it up because they can’t even quote the names of the people who they claim said it.”</p><p>“Running for President requires traveling all over the country, begging for donations all day everyday to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, arguing political talking points everyday to the point of exhaustion, destroying your health and having no personal life in order to attempt to get enough votes to become President all to go to work into a system that refuses to fix any of America’s problems,” Greene wrote.</p><p>She added, “the fact that I’d have to go through all that but would be totally blocked from truly fixing anything is exactly why I would never do it.”</p><p>Trump earlier this month claimed Greene was criticizing him because he discouraged her from running for Senate or governor in Georgia.</p><p>In an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” last week, Greene denied those claims.</p><p>“Well, that is absolutely not true,” Greene told anchor Dana Bash. “Actually, I never had a conversation at all with the president about running for Senate or running for Georgia, and those were decisions I came to on my own.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.</p><p>Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.</p><p>The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.</p><p>Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute will categorize cancer patients as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.</p><p>Registries currently specify whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.</p><p>President Donald Trump in January issued an executive order stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.</p><p>“In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.</p><p>Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.</p><p>“When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.</p><p>“The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”</p><p>For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.</p><p>Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents 97% of the U.S. population. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering nearly half the U.S. population.</p><p>The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.</p><p>For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying rising rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50. As a result, U.S. guidelines now recommend that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.</p><p>States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas initiated a statewide effort aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.</p><p>“Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”</p><p>The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.</p><p>For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.</p><p>The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.</p><p>In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”</p><p>NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.</p><p>According to an analysis of CDC data by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.</p><p>Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.</p><p>“Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.</p><p>A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were two to three times as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.</p><p>A Canadian study concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a 2023 study from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.</p><p>Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.</p><p>There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”</p><p>The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.</p><p>Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and stopping specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.</p><p>Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”</p><p>KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Joseph DeAngelo moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow.</p><p>He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.</p><p>What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the Golden State Killer.</p><p>DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.</p><p>Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”</p><p>Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.</p><p>“He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “The People vs. the Golden State Killer.” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”</p><p>Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.</p><p>DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p>Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.</p><p>CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.</p><p>Serial Killers Fast Facts</p><p>He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.</p><p>It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.</p><p>It was that insatiable appetite for power.</p><p>When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.</p><p>And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.</p><p>And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.</p><p>After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.</p><p>We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.</p><p>A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.</p><p>During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.</p><p>And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.</p><p>Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’</p><p>It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.</p><p>When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.</p><p>DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.</p><p>And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.</p><p>The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.</p><p>I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’</p><p>There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?</p><p>I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.</p><p>I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.</p><p>He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.</p><p>So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>EPL</p><p>Premier League</p><p>Reaction</p><p>Arne Slot looks worryingly short of answers as Liverpool's slide continues Darren Staples/AFP via Getty Images</p><p>Welcome to The Briefing, where every Monday during the season, The Athletic will discuss three of the biggest questions to arise from the weekend’s football.</p><p>This was the round when Arsenal’s Eberechi Eze made history with a hat-trick in the north London derby, Newcastle United earned an invigorating victory against stuttering Manchester City and Aston Villa became the latest, ‘Wow, they’re doing well’ team as they jumped up to fourth by beating struggling Leeds United.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Here we will ask whether it’s too early to question Arne Slot’s position at Liverpool, are Mikel Arteta’s side the complete package, and if Daniel Farke’s sacking at Leeds is inevitable.</p><p>Just when you think it can’t and won’t get any worse for Liverpool, they produce their worst performance of the season.</p><p>At least when they were losing to Crystal Palace and Chelsea, it was due to winning goals in stoppage time after so-so performances, but in their past two league outings they have been comprehensively beaten 3-0 by Manchester City and now Nottingham Forest, who had started Saturday in the relegation zone.</p><p>The form guide has the champions 18th in the six-game Premier League table, with only last-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers earning fewer points.</p><p>This disastrous run now resembles what City went through this time last year. Liverpool have lost six of seven in the league; City, who were also title holders, lost six of eight in November and December.</p><p>City also endured European woes (remember a 4-1 shellacking at Ruben Amorim’s Sporting CP, plus the head-scratching 3-3 draw against Feyenoord having been three up) but there were crucial differences — namely that Pep Guardiola had spent many years proving that he was one of the greatest managers of all time, and that he was trying to work out how to cope with the absence of his most important player (the injured Rodri).</p><p>Last season’s City were a nervous side who lost their mojo and blew leads. Liverpool don’t necessarily look nervous right now: their issue is seemingly one of being unable to cope with adversity. They haven’t earned a single point from a losing position in the 2025-26 Premier League, after falling behind on six occasions (albeit two of those goals were in stoppage time). And unlike Guardiola, Arne Slot doesn’t exude the same confidence that he is about to transform Liverpool’s fortunes.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>At this point, it’s important to note that there are no credible suggestions that Slot is losing the faith of owners FSG, who are far from trigger-happy even at the worst of times. It was only six months ago that the Dutchman was being lauded as a genius after his remarkable debut-season title win. He has plenty of credit in the bank.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Given the extent of Liverpool’s decline, it is also reasonable to ask the question; at what point does Slot’s position become the subject of serious scrutiny? Eight defeats from nine? Ten from 11? Going out of the Champions League?</p><p>In the Premier League, they next travel to resurgent West Ham United, who have won their last two home games under Nuno Espirito Santo, then it’s Sunderland at home, a team who have already won away at Chelsea and held visitors Arsenal to a draw. They are already in the bottom half of the table and it’s conceivable they will still be there as they head into December.</p><p>It’s also possible, of course, that they will be in the Champions League positions, given they’re only two points from fifth place, and this is a volatile season.</p><p>Maybe this is only a weird blip.</p><p>It just doesn’t feel that way.</p><p>There are so many issues to fix in terms of personnel, tactics, and those new signings who are taking a while to integrate after an outlay of around £450million in the summer (a record for one window, let’s not forget).</p><p>But the most concerning aspect is Liverpool’s lack of competitiveness. It looks like they’ve stopped fighting, like some players have downed tools. It looks like they’re either not fighting for the manager or aren’t listening to his instructions; ergo, temporarily or otherwise, Slot is unable to command the dressing room. Again, that’s purely just what it looks like, in terms of body language and in terms of gifted individual players being miles off what we know they are capable of.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Only those in the dressing room really know what’s going on — and also how deeply last season’s players and staff have been impacted by the tragic passing of their friend, colleague and team-mate Diogo Jota in July.</p><p>“We were just not good in terms of the battles, the challenges, the second ball fight,” their captain Virgil van Dijk told reporters on Saturday. “It’s a very, very difficult situation at the moment.”</p><p>Slot will surely be Liverpool head coach for some time yet, but as Jose Mourinho and Claudio Ranieri can testify from their times at Chelsea and Leicester City respectively, that goodwill is never infinite.</p><p>It’s amazing how far common sense can go in football.</p><p>A majority view of Arsenal’s 2024-25 season would have been along the lines of, yep, really good team, exceptional defence, but they haven’t quite got the squad to either go all the way in the Premier League or to compete on four fronts.</p><p>They finished second for a third year running and also got to the semi-finals of both the Champions League and Carabao Cup, but when stars such as Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel and Kai Havertz were injured, they didn’t have enough strength in depth to keep results ticking along. They needed a goalscorer, too.</p><p>So what did Arsenal do? They addressed those flaws, signing seven players (including Sunday’s north London derby hat-trick hero Eberechi Eze), only two of whom (Viktor Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi) were guaranteed starters.</p><p>The difference has been huge. Not only are they the joint-top scorers in the league, but they also probably have the strongest squad, the best team and the best defence.</p><p>Against Tottenham yesterday, Gyokeres, Odegaard and Gabriel were out, three big players through the heart of the side, plus long-term absentees Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, and yet they walloped the team with the Premier League’s best away record.</p><p>It was a comprehensive performance which belied the pressure of both a big derby and of taking advantage of stuttering rivals to pull clear at the top of the table. Arsenal have failed on both these fronts in the past, which led to an obvious assumption that they weren’t mentally strong enough to cross the finish line.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>You can never rule out an unexpected twist. But right now, without an obvious challenger, they look to be enjoying leading from the front.</p><p>They also won this one without needing goals from set pieces (despite Spurs head coach Thomas Frank’s pre-match assertion that whoever won the dead-ball battle would win the match). Tottenham attempted to smother Arsenal but were just overwhelmed.</p><p>Right now, the only way Arsenal won’t win this Premier League title is if they bottle it. Right now, they are more likely to streak too far ahead for that to be a possibility.</p><p>Arsenal are threatening to make winning the Premier League a one-horse race, and the relegation places also have a look of inevitability about them.</p><p>Nottingham Forest were never likely to stay in the bottom three for long, given their squad, and while West Ham looked a bit ropier, the suspicion was that Nuno would sort them out in time. Fulham remain a bit fragile, perhaps due to Marco Silva’s unclear future, but similarly have a decent squad in terms of ability.</p><p>So a current bottom three of Leeds United, Burnley and Wolves feels about right, given the quality or lack of in their respective teams and squads.</p><p>Forest and West Ham acted quickly this season to reverse their slides by sacking their managers, but are Leeds about to do the same?</p><p>In a bizarre way, getting Leeds promoted was probably the worst thing that could have happened to Daniel Farke. Some fans have never been convinced about his top-flight credentials and it always felt inevitable that the first sign of trouble would lead to him being fired.</p><p>Five defeats in six games will do that, but it’s also the manner in which Farke has them lined up. Leeds are physical, and try to be hard to beat, but actually they end up being pretty dull. That approach made him vulnerable when results inevitably turned.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>You do have sympathy for him given the tools at his disposal, though, and you wonder whether Leeds have enough in their ranks to stay up this season, whoever is in charge. A summer of recruitment that focused on tall men and injury-prone forwards always suggested a season of struggle lay ahead.</p><p>“I want them to feel like the world is falling apart when we lose a game; otherwise, you can’t be a Leeds United supporter,” Farke said on Sunday.</p><p>They’re certainly getting enough practice.</p><p>Spot the pattern.

Cricket zombies, if you will.</p><p>Those descriptions were repeated by independent England supporters as if they had all shared the same conversations over the previous 12 hours. Maybe it was group therapy.</p><p>What to do with the spare days was a hot topic. Hanging around Perth’s central business district was one option. The Globe on Wellington Street was the Barmy Army’s self-declared HQ for the first Test and remained clogged with England fans throughout the mythical third day’s play.</p><p>Music from the Vietnamese Spring Fest stage in neighbouring Forrest Place drifted on the breeze, but there were fewer England shirts there by comparison.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>One chosen destination was picturesque Fremantle, although tourist ferries from Perth to the historical port were soon fully booked. Once you did make it there, you encountered problems such as The National Hotel selling out of fish and chips.</p><p>None of these things were likely to improve the mood of England fans who had invested time and money in their trip to Western Australia, and wanted just a little more from their team in return.</p><p>“For me, Bazball has reached the end of the line,” said England supporter Martyn Ranns from his table at The National. His trip from Lymm, Cheshire with six friends had been in the works since the spring. One of those friends, Stewart, was still suffering with “a combination of furious and upset” to talk about his previous 48 hours.</p><p>“After lunch (Saturday) was a complete shambles. The way the defeat played out was just devastating for everybody. The body language, hands on hips, hands behind heads…</p><p>“We’ve been looking forward to this and planning this for a while. We’ve got four spare days now because you have to book things in. You can’t just keep it flexible. There are too many people here!</p><p>“You know Test matches these days are unlikely to go to a fifth day, but you certainly don’t expect them to be over in two. We all support our team but the performance was amateur.</p><p>“For a lot of people, this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. They’ve spent a lot of money to come and do this and everyone’s so deflated.”</p><p>Ranns at least has the consolation of a road trip to Sydney before catching the third Test in Adelaide. He knows others taking in the entire series and already fretting over everything being decided before Christmas at the Adelaide Oval.</p><p>For others, Perth was their sole Test.</p><p>“I’ve got a bucket list of all sorts of things I want to do in my life, and this was one of them,” said Dave Williamson from Grimsby, who flew out to Perth two days before the Test match and will fly back to the UK seven days later. “Even in England I’ve never been to the full five days of a Test match, so the idea of sitting on my own watching the game was something I’d always wanted to do.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“I came here in January and fell in love with the place, fell in love with Rottnest Island. My big problem is I promised my wife I wouldn’t go back there without her. Instead I got to see the quokkas that performed for England yesterday.</p><p>“It is the beauty of live sport. You don’t know what to expect. I want to see the action there and then, and it was unbelievable. But then, I don’t think a sports team has left me so sad and dejected as England did last night. Walking back to the hotel was a demoralising experience.”</p><p>Martin Love’s 60th birthday present to himself was travelling from Eastleigh for the first Test, so there was little hiding how much he was looking forward to his Ashes experience.</p><p>“I’d been looking forward to this for probably 50 years and yeah… it was a bit of a blow, wasn’t it? Two days!” said Love.</p><p>His consolations were getting to play on the WACA — and take a catch — in a Barmy Army charity game, while the Test’s early conclusion will give him more time to track down a friend he met in the Perth suburb of Gosnells in 1993 but with whom he has since lost contact.</p><p>Spending nine days in Bali before returning to his own bed in Eastleigh will also be a welcome stop.</p><p>“I’m slowly getting over it,” added Love. “Coming out of the ground yesterday there were a lot of cocky Australians giving us stick, which was fair enough as we gave a fair bit to them the day before.</p><p>“I love it when Bazball comes off but I’m a bit of a traditionalist and you’ve just got to play the conditions and the situation. A Test match is not two days! It was like two ODIs, the way England batted.</p><p>“I’m not worried about losing. I’m more gutted I don’t now get to go to the ground with the Barmies for two more days. That experience with all the singing and atmosphere was fantastic. I’d have loved it to have been for longer.”</p><p>Field’s trip to Perth was part of a post-retirement jaunt around Asia, including his first visit to Australia.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“For me, it’s the number of people we’ve spoken to,” he said. “My friend in Thailand has very little money and he’s been planning this for a year, saving furiously, and had we known in advance what was going to happen, you don’t need three nights extra in a hotel. That becomes wasted money.</p><p>“I met a lovely guy in his mid 70s with his son last night. They’d come from Nottingham and scrambled the money together. They lost their wife and mother respectively last year, and the son had said, ‘You’ve never done it Dad, you need cheering up, let’s plan for this in 2025’, and they were just desolate they’d seen England bat for less than 70 overs.</p><p>“Other people had friends coming out to join them from England for days three, four and five. I know there’s an element of gamble with that now. We don’t go into it blind. But it’s all about entertainment and with that, you expect something back in return.</p><p>“The retort would be we must realise we can’t predict sport, we can’t suggest they’re not trying, and how would we feel if we’d won in two days? But it’s the lack of recognition from the England senior management or players. People have saved for years. The players all rushed to congratulate Travis Head but not one came over to where the Barmy Army was congregated to acknowledge us.”</p><p>Things were rawer still for Jennifer Sanderson, wandering around Perth Stadium on Saturday night alongside her parents, Rob and Glenis, just hours after Australia had completed their victory.</p><p>The trio flew out from Yorkshire on the Wednesday and will take in the Great Ocean Road, Adelaide and Sydney before returning to the UK in under three weeks’ time — but Perth will be their only Ashes cricket after Jennifer saw her attempts to take in the 2021 series scuppered by Covid.</p><p>“The main bit is the England team tries to force a result,” said Jennifer. “They had a calamitous half hour and then the belief went. But you want a result. You don’t want a five-day draw because you’ve got that entertainment factor and that courage. Travis Head stood up and did it for the Aussies.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Rob, 72, an avid watcher of Test cricket since he was young, added: “I can remember when it was straight bats all morning and you’d be lucky to get 40 runs before lunch. Very slow. It’s a different game today, and I prefer an exciting game.”</p><p>In fact, there was another exciting game on Saturday night, this time at the WACA Ground as Perth Scorchers beat Adelaide Strikers by one run in the WBBL domestic T20 — a game deliberately scheduled to form part of Perth’s West Test festival. Albeit not conclude it.</p><p>“It was a clusterf*** frankly,” said Ben Yearsley, who took his own perfect record watching England in Australia to five defeats out of five at Perth Stadium. “We were genuinely optimistic at lunch.”</p><p>His travelling companion for the week, solely based around the Perth Test, Rob Hudson, added: “And now we end the day celebrating a Perth Scorchers win as a consolation. They were good, but we’re bewildered. I’ve never seen anything like it.</p><p>“This afternoon was just like hell. In a few weeks we might think this was short but very memorable. At the moment we’re wondering what just happened to us. We keep having Aussies coming up to us saying ‘two days, two days’ but they did get bowled out in a session which contributed to that.</p><p>“I mean, we’ve got a nice place in Cottesloe and it’s about -4 degrees at home, so we’re OK really. I don’t think our wives are going to be too pitiful.”</p><p>Perth Stadium was a sorry sight on Sunday morning.</p><p>Fan activities, including a DJ booth dressed up as an oversized red telephone box, were fenced off while a giant inflatable replica of the famous Ashes urn was a puddle of deflation.</p><p>There was some cricket. A small patch of green saw a couple of boys spend a few minutes playing better shots than England managed on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>And there was some life a short walk away from the stadium. The WA Day Festival, part of the West Test schedule, featured rides, stalls, music stages and a maze at nearby Burswood Park. For some of those involved, the Sunday without a Test cricket distraction was actually busier than the Saturday. But maybe that was for other reasons.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>A few things still felt a little off. Seven Sport’s branded area with deck chairs and a big screen promised to show the “summer of cricket live”. At this point, it was showing an episode of TV show, The Voice.</p><p>The shortened Test was arguably the worst case scenario for the WACA, Perth Stadium’s owners Venues Live, and the Western Australian government, who had upped their financial outlay to bring the first match of this Ashes and future Test series to Perth.</p><p>A final attendance of 51,531 took in the first day’s play in Perth. Another 49,983 followed on day two. The total of 101,514 was a Test record for Perth Stadium, despite seeing four days’ play against India in 2024.</p><p>However, ticket sales indicated a similar crowd to Saturday on Sunday, and another high turnout on day four — all of which will now be refunded at a significant loss, reportedly hitting AU$3 million ($1.9m, £1.5m) according to the Australian Associated Press, and without taking into account revenue from food, drinks, partnerships and merchandise.</p><p>Perth Stadium had installed nine additional, 20ft refrigerated shipping containers under the stadium seating to account for one of the biggest events since the venue opening in 2018 — including more than two tonnes of lamb shoulder, 150,000 food items and 6,000 bottles of wine.</p><p>As much as possible of that perishable food will now be donated to OzHarvest, an Australian food bank charity. That happens after any event at Perth Stadium, only this time the donation will far outstrip anything seen before.</p><p>It was also a terrible start to a crucial Ashes series for Cricket Australia, who are among the organisations that take the financial hit. The governing body reported a loss of AU$11.3m at its annual general meeting in October, with the expectation of red turning to black with England’s tour thrown into the following year’s accounting. Further shortened Test matches in this Ashes series will only add to the financial pressure.</p><p>Some England supporters have been left feeling out of pocket too, at least in terms of what they expected to get in return for their outlay. But not everyone.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It’s Sunday night at Darren’s Small Bar in Burswood. There has been no cricket but the joint has still been flushed for the night by England supporters, hosted by the Barmy Army’s Perth Supporters group and raising more than AU$1,000 for the WA Cricket Foundation and the English youth cricket charity, Chance to Shine.</p><p>By the end of the night, the streets are filled with the hopeful chant that England are going to win the Ashes series 4-1.</p><p>Whether they will be there, or not.</p><p>Spot the pattern.
