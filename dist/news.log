{"details":"<p>The US Department of Justice released its latest - and largest - tranche of Jeffrey Epstein files on Tuesday.</p><p>The 11,000-plus documents continue a stream of released information that began on Friday, the deadline mandated in a new law that required the department to publicly release all of its investigative files into the deceased paedophile and financier.</p><p>Many of the documents released on Tuesday are redacted with names and information blacked out, including names of people who the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.</p><p>The justice department is facing criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law specifically states can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p>President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p>The justice department said some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p>Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.</p><p>Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" stands out.</p><p>The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\".</p><p>\"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\"</p><p>In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\"</p><p>The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\".</p><p>An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\".</p><p>Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru.</p><p>In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.</p><p>He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".</p><p>The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response.</p><p>Among the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.</p><p>The emails said six of the 10 co-conspirators had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p>Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p>Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p>Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p>An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p>The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p>Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p>\"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p>Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ.</p><p>\"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday.</p><p>Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p>The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".</p><p>A letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake.</p><p>The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p>\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\"</p><p>The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\"</p><p>The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death.</p><p>The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents.</p><p>The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it.</p><p>\"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X.</p><p>\"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added.</p><p>Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died.</p><p>Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions.</p><p>The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\".</p><p>The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI.</p><p>A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison.</p><p>Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.</p><p>Trump's name appears more in these files than in other batches of documents released by the justice department.</p><p>Notably, in a January 2020 email, a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\".</p><p>The recipient of the email was redacted.</p><p>Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p>Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p>The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p>\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p>The timing of the trips coincide with years in which federal prosecutors were examining Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. She was ultimately found guilty of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse minors.</p><p>But throughout the files released on Tuesday, many of the other mentions of Trump's name are simply in press clippings mentioning him, his campaigns, and other news moments.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to Epstein.</p><p>In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the Department of Justice said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\".</p><p>\"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,\" the justice department said.</p><p>Among one of the odder entries in Tuesday's document drop was a fake video showing an Epstein-like figure in a prison cell, which raised questions of how it had appeared in the department's official files.</p><p>Other documents showed that a man from Florida sent an email to federal investigators in March 2021 with a link to the video.  He asked if it was real, but it is not.</p><p>BBC Verify used a reverse image search to find a copy of the video had been uploaded to YouTube in October 2020. The user who posted it said the clip had been created using 3D graphics.</p><p>According to a 2023 report by the Bureau of Prisons, no video recording from inside Epstein's cell on the day of his death exists.</p><p>The fake video's inclusion in this release gives a glimpse of the questions that federal authorities have received from the general public, many of whom, having heard conspiracy theories or harboured doubts for years, want answers about Epstein's life and death.</p><p>Shayan Sardarizadeh contributed to this report.</p><p>Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.</p><p>Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.</p><p>Why the Catholic Church and Donald Trump’s government are at odds over immigration policy.</p><p>\"Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" wrote Ben Sasse.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The simple act of crossing the road landed gang member Calen Morris in more trouble with the police.</p><p>He had been wearing his leather patch – depicting a horned skull engulfed in red flames, and the gang’s name “Head Hunters” spelled in giant gothic lettering – at a private party at the group’s clubhouse in late October. He left the event, walked across the road to his car and drove off.</p><p>Then, Morris said, his house was raided by the police, who he says seized his patch, arrested him and told his partner to flee with their children. They also raided the clubhouse.</p><p>Morris, 40, is accused of wearing his patch while crossing a public road – a breach of a recent law banning displays of gang insignia in New Zealand. But the bike mechanic, from the west of the country’s most populous city Auckland, claims his patch was folded under his arms and therefore not on display.</p><p>“It meant a lot to me,” said Morris.</p><p>His was one of 192 patches seized by police in the first 12 months of the law being in effect.</p><p>The legislation was the conservative coalition government’s response to growing public concern over a surge in gang membership over the past decade, which brought the country’s reported gang population close to outstripping its number of sworn police officers.</p><p>A year on, more than 850 charges have been laid for breaches of the prohibition order, and the government is touting the law change as a roaring success – claiming a decrease in serious violent crime.</p><p>The patches have all but disappeared from the streets. But the gangs have not.</p><p>According to gang members, the banishment of the patches is just optics – they’re recruiting new members just as fast as before. And even the police admit the most sinister gang activities are still happening.</p><p>Despite tourism campaigns marketing a pristine paradise in the South Pacific, New Zealand has a menacing criminal underbelly. The country’s 37 “identified” gangs and their more than 10,000 known members are credited with running the drug trade – primarily dealing methamphetamine, MDMA and cocaine – and driving violent crime.</p><p>“It’s about a quarter of a percent of our adult population… (committing) about 18% of our serious violent crime,” said Corrie Parnell, an acting assistant commissioner with New Zealand Police.</p><p>Between October 2024, just before the insignia ban came into effect, and August this year, the number of victims of violent offending dropped by 23%, figures from a regular justice ministry crime survey showed.</p><p>The government and police both chalked that up as a win for the patch ban and associated anti-gang measures that were introduced, but the data doesn’t actually spell out what offending is gang-related.</p><p>Parnell did admit it was hard to “draw the nexus” between the seizing of a patch and any change in drug crime or other serious offending like child abuse and sexual assault.</p><p>Ask a gang member if anything has changed and they will likely just laugh.</p><p>“Everyone’s still there, nobody’s scared of anything. Nobody gives a f**k,” said Morris.</p><p>“Serious crime has never been done with a patch on,” said Bronson Edwards, 34, a chapter captain of the Mongrel Mob – one of New Zealand’s most storied gangs, whose mostly indigenous Māori members often seek to shock and provoke by bearing Nazi swastikas, and shouting the rallying cry “Sieg Heil.”</p><p>While the gangs say it’s business as usual, they have generally complied with the patch ban.</p><p>That’s because it’s no small thing for a gang member to lose their patch –– under the lore of the subculture, the patch never really belongs to the individual; it belongs to the gang.</p><p>“It’s so special and sacred to us,” said Edwards. “If you lose your patch there are consequences: you lose a life with us, you get your head kicked in and go back to normal life.”</p><p>Patches, bandanas and even just specific colors are used by gangs globally to state their presence, protect territory and, when conflict erupts, identify who is who. But patches have an elevated status because they’re usually earned by new recruits – known as “prospects” – for doing certain, often nefarious, tasks.</p><p>The law covers insignia in broad terms – defining them as any sign, symbol or representation commonly associated with a gang – and it applies to anything it is displayed on, be that clothing, cars, or even rings. But the legislation does not outlaw gang colors entirely, as lawmakers could not ban plain-colored clothing.</p><p>The punishment for breaching the ban is up to six months in prison, or a maximum fine of $5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,870). In the first six months of the law being in effect, 22 people were jailed, according to authorities.</p><p>Outlaw motorcycle clubs and patched street gangs began to spread their roots into New Zealand society in the 1960s, with the opening of local chapters of overseas gangs, like the US-founded Hells Angels, and the establishment of homegrown gangs like the Mongrel Mob, the Nomads, Black Power (which has no connection to the US civil rights movement), and others.</p><p>At a time when indigenous Māori were being uprooted from their ancestral homes as part of an urbanization push, and amid an immigration crackdown on Polynesian people who had moved to New Zealand from the Pacific Islands in search of work and education, gangs – offering fraternity, status and protection – became a draw card for marginalized people.</p><p>Over the decades, the gangs have become what many would consider an unwelcome part of New Zealand life. Drive down the motorway in Auckland, and there’s a chance your vehicle will be swarmed and overtaken by dozens of bikies out on a weekend ride. Or stop off for a bite to eat in a small town and you might find yourself standing next to a leather-clad gang member ordering a sandwich.</p><p>Roughly 10 years ago, new gangs began to set up shop – some founded by serious criminals booted out of Australia under a controversial Canberra policy that deported visa holders who failed a “character” test, even if they had lived most of their lives in Australia.</p><p>The newly established gangs quickly began to grow and muscle in on the drug trade –– building connections with notorious overseas organized crime syndicates, like Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, co-founded by notorious narco Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.</p><p>Turf wars and renewed rivalries led to gun violence that played out in public, with gang members shot dead in the streets, and the homes of innocent families left riddled with bullet holes after being shot at in the night by gang members who got the wrong address.</p><p>Public frustration built and, in 2023, the funeral of a high-profile gang leader became a political flashpoint when two small North Island towns were brought to a standstill, and a state highway closed, as hundreds of patched bikies rolled in to pay their respects.</p><p>Assistant commissioner Parnell said reports of communities “feeling overwhelmed by the presence of patched gang members” were not uncommon.</p><p>But he said the insignia ban had drawn a line and people were now able to “go about their business and actually feel safe… without being impeded by en masse patched gang members.”</p><p>Where farmland meets the Pacific Ocean in the north of Hawke’s Bay, on the eastern coast of the North Island, sits the tiny town of Wairoa. One of the few remaining Māori-majority places in New Zealand, it has a population of just 5,000.</p><p>Wairoa has been beset by gang violence for decades, including some high-profile gang murders. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power have a strong presence.</p><p>The local mayor Craig Little said there has been “a real big turnaround” since the insignia law took effect. “You’re not seeing gang members walking down your main street or anywhere really.”</p><p>The gang patches, Little said, were intimidating for some members of the public, particularly visitors to the town. “People aren’t missing them, that’s for sure.”</p><p>The mayor estimated that 80% of the town’s crime was related to gangs. But he wasn’t convinced the patch ban had made any difference to the local crime rate: “I’d say it’s the same, but police are saying it’s less.”</p><p>Edwards, captain of the town’s Mongrel Mob chapter, agreed the law has made no real difference to crime. “We’re still out there, out on the street, just less visible –– which, you know, (with) the things that I want to do, that works out quite fine,” he said.</p><p>The self-described mobster said conflict between the two gangs in the town was still happening, because “some people still needed to learn some lessons.”</p><p>Gang membership in New Zealand is more than just about being part of a club. Often, it’s a family affair.</p><p>“I’ve grown up around bikes my whole life. All my uncles are Head Hunters, so it’s just one of those things,” said Morris. “I didn’t think anything of it when I joined the club, I just said: Yo, I’ll join… and I prospected for a whole year.”</p><p>And it’s the depth of those family ties – which span generations – that make gang membership in New Zealand distinct; it’s not a phase people just grow out of, but more of a lifetime commitment, often from birth.</p><p>“What a lot of people don’t realize is we’ve created our own culture, our own whanau (family), and that aspect is heavy here in the Hawke’s Bay,” said Edwards, who is also part of a multi-generational gang family.</p><p>“We’ve got third generation, second generation now,” he said. And because of that, he says he’s trying to focus the attention of members of his gang into things like boxing, rather than fighting on the streets. “We’re all family and the last thing we want is for our families to be doing life (in prison),” Edwards said.</p><p>But blood relatives often end up in rival gangs too.</p><p>That is “a real sad thing,” said Little, Wairoa’s mayor. “Most of the gang members are related in some way or form, so it seems ridiculous that they are fighting each other.”</p><p>For those without family ties, being in a gang is primarily about having a community of “like-minded bros” to ride bikes and have a drink with, according to Morris. Very few gang members get caught up in real crime, he said.</p><p>“We’ve got 300 members and, like, only 5% is in jail for dumb s**t. You know, the majority of us are business owners.”</p><p>Morris himself has a prior conviction for unlawful gun possession, but claims he is not involved in the organized crime side of gang life.</p><p>Family, community and the claimed sanctity of the patch are not much of a consideration for the government’s Police Minister Mark Mitchell, who appears confident he has taught the gangs a lesson.</p><p>“They can no longer behave as if they’re above the law by taking over our streets, intimidating the public, and making a mockery of our criminal justice system,” he said on the anniversary of the law change.</p><p>State agencies in New Zealand keep a national list of patched gang members and prospects, which experts say is easy to get on, but hard to get off.</p><p>In early November 2025, there were 10,242 people on the list. That is a large number for a country of just 5.3 million people, and is proportionally higher than previously reported estimates of gang members in Australia and Britain.</p><p>The tally has been weaponized by political figures, including Mitchell while he was in opposition, to stoke fear that the country’s number of gang members might overtake the number of sworn police officers. The latter figure stood at 10,368 in early November, according to Mitchell’s response to a written parliamentary question.</p><p>Despite the patch ban and other new anti-gang measures that came into effect, the gang list has grown by more than 700 in the past year.</p><p>Parnell, the assistant commissioner, said he expects the number of gang members to come down over the next five years. But the gangs doubt that, saying the ban has had no impact on their pulling power.</p><p>“Numbers have grown,” said Edwards, speaking about his Mongrel Mob chapter. “They always will.”</p><p>Morris, the Head Hunter, said his gang had recruited more people too.</p><p>“There’s more of us. Yeah, you can take my patch off me, but it just doesn’t change anything,” he said.</p><p>Both men are before the courts for breaching the prohibition order.</p><p>Edwards was accused of wearing his Mongrel Mob patch in public at a tangi – a Māori funeral – earlier this year. He claims that when police came to his home to seize his patch they showed him “paparazzi-type photos” taken from “over in the bushes” on the day of the tangi. “Those are the lengths that they’re going to,” he said.</p><p>Similarly, Morris said he was filmed by police standing “down the end of the road” when he was accused of breaching the ban.</p><p>When asked if this was usual practice, police said they use both “overt and covert techniques” to gather evidence. Rather than confronting gang members on the spot, they will opt to take videos and photographs in situations when police know they’re outnumbered, at events that might become emotionally charged –– like funerals –– or if there is a risk to public safety.</p><p>Police now have specialist organized crime teams in most regions, whose officers act like envoys to gangs and hold talks with senior figures, particularly around managing upcoming gang events, like funerals or sports days, that risk becoming a public nuisance. “We will engage a number of weeks out and set out: these are the rules of engagement,” said Parnell. And those rules are pragmatic. Gang members can wear their insignia on private land, but risk arrest as soon as they set foot on public property –– like roads, footpaths or local sports fields.</p><p>Some gang members have been arrested for being spotted wearing insignia in public on security camera footage from shops and other videos posted to social media.</p><p>With so many members’ patches now being seized, gangs are having to rethink the hardline policy of punishing members who lose them. “You don’t even have a chance to fight for it because you’re not home,” said Edwards, explaining that they’re often seized from the homes of gang members after they have been arrested.</p><p>“So… we can’t really hold brothers accountable.”</p><p>Even so, the patches and affiliated gang emblems remain “like a code of honor,” said Morris. And new recruits still want to earn them.</p><p>Just days before his arrest for allegedly breaching the patch ban, Morris proudly showed off his new tattoo –– the Head Hunters gang insignia permanently brandished across his back.</p><p>“I earned it, like I earned my colors,” said Morris, who likened it to having a customary tattoo. “They tell a story about where we come from, what we’ve been through and what we achieved.”</p><p>Insignia tattoos are a growing trend among gang members, because the new law doesn’t stretch that far. “I could go walk up and down the street with no shirt on. It’s the same as a patch,” said Morris.</p><p>“It’s like: Haha, f**k you, you can’t take this one.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p>Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p>\"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p>Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ.</p><p>\"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday.</p><p>Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p>The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".</p><p>A letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake.</p><p>The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p>\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love & caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\"</p><p>The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\"</p><p>The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death.</p><p>The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents.</p><p>The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it.</p><p>\"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X.</p><p>\"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added.</p><p>Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died.</p><p>Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions.</p><p>The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\".</p><p>The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI.</p><p>A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison.</p><p>Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.</p><p>Trump's name appears more in these files than in other batches of documents released by the justice department.</p><p>Notably, in a January 2020 email, a federal prosecutor in New York wrote that newly received flight records \"reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware)\".</p><p>The recipient of the email was redacted.</p><p>Trump was listed as a passenger on \"at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996\", and Ghislaine Maxwell was present on at least four of those flights, the prosecutor wrote. Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p>Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p>The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p>\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p>The timing of the trips coincide with years in which federal prosecutors were examining Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her. She was ultimately found guilty of conspiring with Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse minors.</p><p>But throughout the files released on Tuesday, many of the other mentions of Trump's name are simply in press clippings mentioning him, his campaigns, and other news moments.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in regards to Epstein.</p><p>In a statement accompanying Tuesday's release, the Department of Justice said the new files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election\".</p><p>\"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already,\" the justice department said.</p><p>Among one of the odder entries in Tuesday's document drop was a fake video showing an Epstein-like figure in a prison cell, which raised questions of how it had appeared in the department's official files.</p><p>Other documents showed that a man from Florida sent an email to federal investigators in March 2021 with a link to the video.  He asked if it was real, but it is not.</p><p>BBC Verify used a reverse image search to find a copy of the video had been uploaded to YouTube in October 2020. The user who posted it said the clip had been created using 3D graphics.</p><p>According to a 2023 report by the Bureau of Prisons, no video recording from inside Epstein's cell on the day of his death exists.</p><p>The fake video's inclusion in this release gives a glimpse of the questions that federal authorities have received from the general public, many of whom, having heard conspiracy theories or harboured doubts for years, want answers about Epstein's life and death.</p><p>Shayan Sardarizadeh contributed to this report.</p><p>Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.</p><p>Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.</p><p>Why the Catholic Church and Donald Trump’s government are at odds over immigration policy.</p><p>\"Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" wrote Ben Sasse.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>They called themselves the “Women in Red.” Dressed in crimson robes and white caps, they marched with faces downturned in silent protest against Israel’s government in the year before the war in Gaza. Borrowing imagery from Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the group meant to sound an alarm: the government’s judicial overhaul threatened to undo decades of progress on women’s rights.</p><p>Three years later, what the government dismissed as theatrical exaggeration is increasingly viewed as prescient foreshadowing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government, which relies upon the support of ultra-Orthodox parties, is moving Israel toward a more religious and conservative future.</p><p>Alongside broader efforts to weaken the Supreme Court – long the cornerstone of Israeli women’s equality – have come specific threats to women’s rights. Netanyahu’s religious partners have pushed bills expanding religious authority over civil life, including gender segregation in cultural events and education. With the power to collapse Netanyahu’s government should they withdraw their support, the religious parties have been able to bend the secular prime minister to their will.</p><p>The decline in women’s rights is measurable. Israel’s global standing on gender equality has plunged in recent years. In the 2025–26 Women, Peace and Security Index, produced by Georgetown University, Israel ranks 84 of 181 countries – behind Albania, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Before the current government came into power three years ago, it ranked 27.</p><p>The precipitous drop parallels a sharp decline in women’s representation in public life. Today, only six of Israel’s 33 ministers are women and few have senior roles. The current government has not made a single permanent appointment of a woman as director-general across over 30 ministries. No woman currently heads a major political party, and Netanyahu’s coalition includes two parties that have zero women on their lists.</p><p>“The deterioration in Israel’s gender equality ranking is unprecedented, placing us in the lower half of countries worldwide – a stark contrast to decades in which Israel ranked among the leaders and was known as a pioneer in advancing women’s rights,” said Daphna Hacker of Tel Aviv University’s Faculty of Law and Gender Studies.</p><p>Hacker ticked off a list of historical accomplishments for women’s equality in Israel: the 1951 Equal Rights for Women Law, considered revolutionary at the time; Golda Meir serving as one of the first female leaders in the world in 1969; the military’s mandatory conscription of women.</p><p>But Hacker, who also serves as the chair of the Israel Women’s Network, said women are now “virtually absent” from key decisions. “There’s no doubt women’s status has waned in recent years,” she said. “We’ve never experienced such a backlash.”</p><p>One bill under debate at Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, which could be finalized in the coming weeks, would dramatically expand the authority of state-run religious courts to handle civil disputes. These courts, staffed exclusively by men who rule according to Jewish law, already oversee marriage and divorce proceedings, including for secular couples. Under the proposed legislation, they would gain power to rule on financial disputes, business matters, and potentially child custody issues.</p><p>“This bill seeks to place women’s fate in the hands of a religious judiciary that inherently discriminates against them,” said Bonot Alternativa, the women’s protest group that once led the Women in Red. “We will not allow the government to force us into marriage with a system that despises us,” it said in a statement while its members protested as gagged brides in chains outside a rabbinical court in Tel Aviv earlier this month.</p><p>CNN has reached to Israel’s Ministry for Social Equality for comment.</p><p>Israel’s rabbinical courts are state-sanctioned religious courts that have legal authority over Jewish family law.</p><p>They have long been criticized by Israeli women as an arena of disadvantage, patriarchy and inequality, especially in matters like alimony and child support. The Ruth and Emanuel Rackman Center at Bar Ilan University warned last month that the proposed expansion would lead to “serious violations of divorcing women’s rights, potentially the most serious that the Israeli justice system has seen in years.” If passed, the new law would also apply to Muslim Sharia courts.</p><p>Proponents of the bill note that the rabbinical courts used to handle financial affairs until Israel’s highest court stripped them of that authority in 2006. Now they intend to override that ruling.</p><p>“We will restore what was stolen and return the authorities to the rabbinical courts,” Simcha   Rothman, the coalition chair of the Knesset judiciary committee, said in April. “We need not only to restore the judges but to restore the law to its place.”</p><p>The Yachin Research Center, a religious think tank in Israel, welcomed the bill as “an important step in restoring the place of Hebrew law.”</p><p>Moriah, a mother of two girls in her late thirties, has been entangled for over four years in custody and property battles in the rabbinical courts. “In four years, not a single one of my requests has ever been approved – yet every absurd request from the other side was granted,” she said, describing an ordeal that has left her estranged from her two young daughters. Moriah, who opted not to use her last name for her protection, said her visitation rights were revoked, while financial rulings pushed her into serious debt without opportunity to respond or appeal.</p><p>“It’s an anti-woman institution,” she told CNN, referring to rabbinical courts. “Three male judges sit in front of you, and then the husband and his lawyer, usually a man. You are usually the only woman in the room. It’s a man’s game, built on religious authority, and it’s designed to break you.”</p><p>The proposed legislation passed its first reading in November with a 63-43 vote. Two weeks later, another law was finalized giving rabbinical courts authority over child support without both parents’ consent.</p><p>Israel is not the only country to reverse women’s rights in recent years. The US Supreme Court removed the protections of Roe v. Wade, and Hungary shut down gender studies programs while explicitly pursuing pro-natalist policies.</p><p>In Israel, these steps are combined with what Hacker calls “the most extreme versions of Judaism – both ultra-Orthodox and nationalist – and it has profound consequences for women.” Most alarming is the surge in violence and femicide. So far this year, 44 women have been murdered in Israel, the highest annual tally in a decade and well above the 35 who were murdered in 2024.</p><p>Women’s advocates also link the recent surge in femicide to the surge in gun ownership – up 40% since the far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir eased licensing after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. According to data from the Ministry of Welfare, the number of women applying to block partners’ gun permits jumped from five in 2023 to 90 in 2024.</p><p>“This is the worst government for women in the history of the country,” said opposition lawmaker Merav Cohen, who chairs the Knesset committee on the status of women and gender equality. “At best, this government is indifferent to the harm done to women. At worst, it’s actively normalizing it.”</p><p>“In any normal country, such a situation would prompt the government to declare an emergency, bring everyone together, draft an action plan, increase budgets – because all the warning lights are flashing red.”</p><p>Cohen said the new rabbinical courts proposal is part of a broader trend within Israeli society of what she warns is a threat to women’s rights, pushed by a religious minority with political power.</p><p>“The religious system is expanding as far as it can go,” she said. “Israeli women are paying the price of Netanyahu’s coalition and are being dragged back decades.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Listen to this article</p><p>Christmas is a time when families get together if they can - and, until this year, the Murdochs were no different. With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts.</p><p>But more often in recent years it was Rupert - for many decades the most influential media titan in the world - and his daughter Elisabeth who would make time for each other.</p><p>She would certainly have room this year to host her father at the luxurious home she has renovated on the edge of the Cotswolds. But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.</p><p>Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.</p><p>Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.</p><p>Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. But this time, the schism feels more permanent. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come.</p><p>James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable. Earlier this year, he described his dad as a \"misogynist\" in an interview in US magazine The Atlantic, and referred to some of Rupert's behaviour in the courtroom fight as \"twisted\".</p><p>He is known to feel betrayed and angered by Rupert's decision to force him, Elisabeth and Prudence formally to cut ties with Fox Corp and News Corp. Driven by fears over the more liberal direction they might want the companies to take after his death, the media mogul tried to change the terms of a trust that gave his four oldest children equal control when he dies.</p><p>Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise.</p><p>Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch actually lost the first round of their court fight. The trust had been set up in 1999, when Rupert divorced Anna, the mother of Lachlan, Elisabeth and James.</p><p>The judge ruled that changing it was in bad faith. But behind the scenes, the warring sides eventually came to an agreement. James, Elisabeth and Prudence agreed to sell their shares. They have accepted terms that include not being allowed to buy any equity in the family company in future.</p><p>\"It's a sad ending,\" Claire Atkinson, whose biography of Rupert Murdoch will come out next year, told us on The Media Show.</p><p>\"These kids worked in the business, they grew up in the business, and the press release said, 'You can't buy shares in this company,' and effectively said, 'Don't let the door hit you on the way out.'\"</p><p>She also told me: \"This break is extremely permanent. It feels like James and Rupert will never patch up their differences.\"</p><p>Lachlan Murdoch has been quoted as saying that the resolution is \"good news for investors\" and \"gives us clarity about our strategy going forward\".</p><p>Ironically, his successful leadership of Fox Corp, where he's been CEO since 2019 (he became chairman of Fox and also News Corp in 2023 when his father became chairman emeritus), made the deal more costly.</p><p>Fox Corp has seen its share price double under Lachlan and the Trump presidency has brought a ratings bonanza. It raised the amount he had to pay his siblings to get them out - a presumably unwelcome side effect.</p><p>Despite the payout, Atkinson says, \"There is a fracture in the company and a fracture in the family.\"</p><p>So where do the Murdochs go from here, privately and corporately?</p><p>Elisabeth and her half-sister Prudence are said to be concentrating on moving on.</p><p>Their father turned 94 in March, with the court battle in full swing. The sisters are mindful that he won't be around forever and I am told they are hoping at some point to repair the rift.</p><p>However much they have felt betrayed by him (and there is no doubt, they have felt it, very painfully), there's an understanding of the dwindling number of years he has left.</p><p>But Christmas may still be too soon for reconciliation. Lachlan hosted his annual party for the Australian elite at his harbour-side Sydney home earlier this month. Fox Corp may operate out of the US, but he is said to prefer the laid-back nature of Australian life, even if the trade-off is business calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference, as well as a lot of flights.</p><p>Atkinson says he is popular and well-liked within the business. \"The difficulty that Lachlan has is that he's been in charge for years, but everybody is always going to project that every decision is Rupert's. He's never going to want to say, 'Hey, that's me,' and so I think it's a little hard to come out from Dad's shadow.\"</p><p>At the same time, Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, says that while Rupert remains a presence in the company \"what's really unique about Lachlan's approach, or what will be unique about his approach, won't fully emerge\".</p><p>Fox News is the financial cash cow, which may explain Rupert Murdoch's concerns that his children might have wanted to change its political affiliations.</p><p>Under Lachlan, there's been a successful strategy to expand into digital and streaming, most notably the ad-supported video-on-demand service, Tubi.</p><p>In September, US President Donald Trump said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch were expected to be part of a group of investors trying to buy TikTok in the US. On Thursday, TikTok parent company ByteDance announced to staff that it had signed an agreement to sell a portion of TikTok to a group of mostly US based investors. Lachlan and Rupert were not named as part of the deal.</p><p>Presenting the Fox Corporation's results for July to September, Lachlan said Tubi had achieved rapid revenue growth and growth in view time, confirming its position as the top premium advertising-based video-on-demand platform in the US.</p><p>\"And I'm happy to say Tubi reached profitability this past quarter,\" he added. \"It's a great milestone.\"</p><p>He also said Fox News had maintained strong ratings throughout the quarter, cementing its status as the most-watched cable network in prime time, and leading to the highest advertising revenue for July-September quarter in Fox's history.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch's 70-year career saw him as \"both an interventionist editor-in-chief figure and a political kingmaker\", according to Paddy Manning, an investigative journalist who wrote The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch. But he adds, \"Lachlan is less of the journalist and powerbroker than his father, and more of a businessman.</p><p>\"If you look at the signature deals that Lachlan has made over his career, they have not been designed to increase his political influence. From digital real estate to sports betting to commercial radio to Tubi, Lachlan's investment decisions are focused on the bottom line, not burnishing his political credentials.\"</p><p>But Prof Benson suggests the significant debt the Murdoch businesses have taken on as part of the settlement with Lachlan's siblings increases pressure to make profit, and therefore to pursue \"politically sensationalistic… outrage journalism\".</p><p>\"The proven way to be profitable in cable/streaming news is not by becoming more centrist and civil, it's by becoming more extreme, more polarising, and more willing to stir outrage,\" he says.</p><p>Rupert has had a hotline to major political figures for decades. In September he was on President Trump's guestlist for the state banquet at Windsor Castle. I'm told he spent nearly two weeks in London and was in the News UK office most days.</p><p>While Lachlan now runs the company, his father is still very much involved. Rupert's been described to me, at 94, as still \"the sharpest person in the room\" and a \"phenomenon who loves papers and has ink in his veins\". His voice may be a little softer, but he is mentally as strong and influential as ever, I'm told.</p><p>At one point the editor of the Times introduced Rupert to a slightly startled young journalist on the newsdesk and asked him to show the boss the paper's recently launched Live app and what it showed around reader engagement on specific stories.</p><p>Rupert also spoke to Fraser Nelson, the former Spectator editor now Times columnist, who usually sits at the open plan table in the office. They discussed the company's pivot to video and the work Nelson had been trialling around short form video. Rupert also wanted to talk to his paper's new star about whether Nigel Farage would end up in government.</p><p>Three months on from the family trust dispute settlement, Mr Manning claims that the Murdochs are \"deeply divided\".</p><p>\"While Lachlan works closely with his father, I understand he remains estranged from his elder siblings,\" he alleges.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch and his children Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence were all approached for comment.</p><p>Presciently, Anna Murdoch - Lachlan, James and Elisabeth's mother - predicted much of the fallout back in the 1980s.</p><p>In her novel Family Business, Anna, a journalist and author, wrote about the rise of a fictional newspaper dynasty and explored sibling rivalry, jealousy and how parental power can negatively impact family relationships. The plot of the book, published while her children were in their teens, follows how a newspaper owner's children are shaped by a parent who turns them into competitors in a power struggle.</p><p>A decade after it was published - by which time the pair had divorced and Rupert had married third wife Wendi Deng - Anna gave an interview to an Australian women's magazine, during which she was asked which of her children would be best suited to take over from her ex-husband.</p><p>\"Actually I'd like none of them to,\" she said. \"I think they're all so good that they could do whatever they wanted really. But I think there's going to be a lot of heartbreak and hardship with this [succession]. There's been such a lot of pressure that they needn't have had at their age.\"</p><p>The family trust, agreed between Rupert and Anna as part of their divorce settlement, was her way of safeguarding her children's futures, by ensuring they had equality after Rupert's death. But that blew up - through a court fight in Nevada and a settlement.</p><p>And with that, relations with three of his six children may have blown up too - perhaps for good.</p><p>Top picture credits: Getty Images and Reuters</p><p>BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

{"details":"<p>Jesse Romero, a conservative Catholic podcaster, has some choice words for Pope Leo XIV.</p><p>\"The Pope should tell us how to get to heaven,\" says Romero. \"He has no authority over the government; he has to stay in his lane.\"</p><p>As a Donald Trump supporter, he is angry about criticism made by the American-born Pope and US bishops about his mass deportation policy.</p><p>With one in five Americans identifying as Catholic, the Church plays an important role in American life - and politics.</p><p>Catholics like Vice President JD Vance, and influential legal activist Leonard Leo, were an important part of Donald Trump's electoral success. They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.</p><p>But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.</p><p>When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.</p><p>Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p>A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p>The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p>It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. It was backed by the Pope, who called the statement \"very important\" and urged all Catholics and \"people of goodwill, to listen carefully\" to it.</p><p></p><p>\"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.</p><p>Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson.</p><p>\"Many of them are angry. They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p>White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p>Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p>Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population.</p><p>The growing power and prominence of right-wing Catholics in the political sphere is exemplified by JD Vance, a convert to the religion who says his politics are shaped by his faith. Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p>But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p>In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p>The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p>\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p>Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee.</p><p>St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\".</p><p>Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p>While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p>And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p><p>Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p>\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p>\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p>He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p>\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p>He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p>Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p>\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p>\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p>Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p>\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p>For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p>\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p>Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p>\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"</p><p>The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.</p><p>The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.</p><p>The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>\"Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" wrote Ben Sasse.</p><p>Donna Hughes-Brown has reunited with her family after five months in an immigration detention unit in Kentucky.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>One year ago this week, Joe Biden was president. I was in Doha, Qatar, negotiating with Israel and Hamas to finalize a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The incoming Trump team worked closely with us, a rare display of nonpartisanship to free hostages and end a war. It feels like a decade ago. A lot can happen in a year, as 2025 has shown.</p><p>Today, the United States has the largest military buildup in the Caribbean since the Cuban missile crisis. Russian envoys are in Miami to discuss a new ceasefire proposal for Ukraine, even as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to escalate the war there. The US installed a three-star general in Israel to oversee a ceasefire in Gaza after bombing Iran over the summer. President Donald Trump is planning a Beijing summit that might determine the fate of Taiwan, as well as our competition with China in the fields of advanced technologies and AI.</p><p>The past year feels more transformational than transitional, with 2026 now shaping up to be a hinge year — with multiple inflection points on the global agenda.</p><p>Let’s break it down, with seven issues that I’ll be watching closely:</p><p>The Trump administration has deployed the largest armada in the Caribbean and western Atlantic since the height of the Cold War. The force includes an aircraft carrier strike group, multiple destroyers, amphibious assault forces, stealth bombers, and special operations units. The goal remains unclear, but the US military is undertaking a deadly campaign against alleged drug traffickers — now with nearly 30 strikes without any congressional authorization or open debate. Over the past week, Trump upped the tension with a declared military blockade against illicit oil shipments and seizure of more oil tankers.</p><p>This looks like a regime change policy with military force to back it up. The White House seems to hope that Venezuela’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, will leave power willingly to live out his days in Russia or elsewhere.  Trump reportedly made that demand directly.</p><p>But that is unlikely to happen. There are few examples of economic pressure and external threats alone forcing a leader like Maduro to cede power. (The removal of Haitian military leader Raoul Cedras in 1994 is one, but there the US military was already in the air to invade the country before he succumbed.)</p><p>Trump is now asserting that the US will be the predominant power in the Western Hemisphere, prepared to use force when necessary to advance American interests.</p><p>The administration calls its new policy a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, which warned European colonial powers to stay out of our backyard. In the time of Monroe, however, the US did not have a navy. Now, a significant portion of the strongest naval force on the planet is positioned off Venezuela.</p><p>What does it all mean? The fate of Maduro in 2026 may answer that question. If he stays in power, Trump risks being viewed as more bark than bite. If he leaves, few could doubt Trump’s seriousness as a hemispheric hegemon. For me, none of this seems well thought through, but the die has been cast and how it resolves over the coming year will say much about what to expect from the “Trump Corollary” over the rest of his second term.</p><p>In February, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will enter its fifth year. Putin’s intent back then was to seize Kyiv and destroy Ukraine as a sovereign country. Today, his forces are bogged down in eastern Ukraine not far from Russia’s borders and have suffered over 1 million casualties. This war has been a debacle for Russia, and yet Putin shows no signs of backing down even if his objectives are now more limited.</p><p>The fifth year of a war can be a tipping point, towards peace as warring parties approach exhaustion or take riskier gambles to break a stalemate. Putin claims to be a student of history and likely views the coming year as an opportunity to break Ukraine’s will.</p><p>In Ukraine today, however, neither side seems poised for a breakthrough. Year five may look much like the last four — with Putin pouring manpower into a meat grinder to pick up limited territory month-by-month, and Ukraine counting on support from its partners in the West for economic support and military supplies. Trump is pursuing a peace deal that would reportedly guarantee Ukraine’s security in exchange for Ukraine ceding land as a means for Putin to climb down from maximalist aims.</p><p>Putin thus far shows no sign of doing this and the question then is whether Trump rightly blames him for the failed negotiations or decides to back away altogether and weaken Ukraine’s ability to withstand the onslaught. In this regard, the fifth year of this war may be decisive indeed — albeit more so in Washington than on the battlefield.</p><p>One defining image of 2025 may be the chummy embrace during a Beijing gathering of Putin along with China’s President Xi Jinping, and North Korea’s President Kim Jong Un, with Iran’s president in the background. These four countries (known as CRINK) are working together to support Russia in Ukraine and aim for a divided world with Russia and China calling the shots in their so-called spheres of influence as the US recedes. Theirs is a world in which large powers assert their will, and smaller powers succumb to it.</p><p>Curiously, the policies of the Trump administration seem to align with this view. Its new National Security Strategy, or NSS, describes the US as a hemispheric power and says, “The days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.” The document goes on to berate traditional European allies as feckless and at risk of “civilizational erasure” due to lax immigration policies. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump’s NSS seems to “correspond in many ways to our vision.”</p><p>Taiwan is where this no longer becomes academic. Washington for a half century has enabled the growth of Taiwan and helped keep the peace with an ambiguous policy that recognizes Taiwan as a part of China while maintaining security and economic ties with the island. Trump last week approved the largest arms package in history for Taiwan, totaling nearly $11 billion in missiles, drones, and advanced air defense equipment. China, meanwhile, is known to be preparing its military to be ready for an invasion of Taiwan by 2027.</p><p>When Trump travels to Beijing for a summit with Xi as expected this spring, Taiwan will be a central topic — and its future may be on the line. This is among the highest-stakes issue on the global security agenda. Taiwan is central to our daily lives, where most semiconductor chips that power our cars and phones are made, and the projections of global disruption should China invade or de-stabilize the island approach $10 trillion.</p><p>Yet, it remains unclear whether Trump will back up decades of American policy — as his recent arms sale suggests — or cede interest in pursuit of a trade deal and acceptance of Beijing as dominant in its sphere — as his NSS previews. His Beijing summit will be watched closely in Taipei, with the adage: when not at the table, you’re on the menu.</p><p>In terms of military success, Israel had a good year. It started with a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza and is ending with all living hostages freed and a 20-point ceasefire plan that is endorsed by the UN Security Council and calls on Hamas to disarm. Iran is in its weakest position since its 1979 revolution. Leaders of the terrorist groups that once surrounded Israel — Hamas and Hezbollah — are dead.</p><p>Overall, however, Israel has failed to translate military success into lasting political and diplomatic achievements, in part due to its own divisions.  Israel today is governed by one of the narrowest coalitions in its history, dominated by nationalist rightwing parties that polarize Israeli society and alienate new openings with Arab capitals.  Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the longtime leader of Israel’s traditional right, refers to himself as the most liberal member of his own extreme right coalition government.</p><p>Few Israelis believe this narrow governing formula after two years of war can or should last much longer. In 2026, they will have a chance to do something about it. Israel must hold parliamentary elections by October 27, 2026, four years after the last vote, and the elections might come sooner if Netanyahu calls for them or his government fails to pass a budget in the spring. The outcome may determine whether Israel is able to consolidate its military success or remain in a fragile and uncertain status quo.</p><p>If Israel emerges from these elections with a new unity coalition or at least a coalition without the extremist members of Netanyahu’s current government, the odds increase that Trump can expand the Abraham Accords before the end of his term — to include a deal with Saudi Arabia. If the elections deadlock and fail to produce a new government or worse produce the government that Israel has now, then there is unlikely to be any diplomatic progress, and Israel may well forfeit a historic opportunity.</p><p>Iran had a horrible year, and 2026 may be worse. Not long ago, Iran claimed strength and influence across the Middle East through proxy networks it controlled — Hezbollah, Hamas, Iraqi militias, and the Houthis — as well as a vaunted missile program, sophisticated Russian air defenses, and a nuclear program advancing beyond any conceivable civilian use case. Tehran enjoyed a staunch ally in Bashar al-Assad and used Syria as a staging ground to strengthen its networks across the region and surround Israel with a declared aim to wipe it from the map.</p><p>That’s all been turned on its head. Iran made the fateful choice to join the mayhem after Hamas’ invasion of Israeli on October 7, 2023. It never anticipated the blowback. Today, many of its leaders are dead. Its proxies are dismantled. Its air defenses are destroyed. Its nuclear program is buried. Its Syrian ally is gone.</p><p>The country is hobbled militarily and economically. A water shortage may result in evacuations and rationing in Tehran.  On top of that, its Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, is 86 years old, reportedly ill, rarely seen in public, and there is no named successor.</p><p>In 2026, nothing gets better for Iran. Israel may well strike Iran again should the country move to restore its nuclear program or — as has been reported — its missile arsenal. Iran’s youthful population rejects the ruling clerical system and with a succession crisis after Khamenei, that system may teeter. At the same time, a hobbled regime might lash out with terrorism or with reckless attacks on Israel. So, pay attention to Iran this year. As in 2025, there may be some surprises there.</p><p>I was recently asked on a podcast what keeps me up at night after two decades in the field of national security and diplomacy. My answer was terrorism. That has not been a fashionable answer in national security circles over the last decade, as successive administrations have sought to emphasize great power competition with China and Russia partly to veer away from the hard and resource-intensive work of countering threats from extremist groups around the world, including Al Qaeda and ISIS.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are always one attack away from changing the course of history — something we must never forget even 25 years after 9/11.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2018, I helped lead the campaign against ISIS. The US built an international coalition of 80 countries and organizations such as INTERPOL to track ISIS operatives, combat its financing, counter its ideology, and uproot its networks. It worked: between 2014 and 2020, the number of terror attacks worldwide, heavily influenced by ISIS, dropped by nearly 60%. The sophisticated attacks that we saw across Europe in 2015 and 2016, such as in Paris (November 2015) and Brussels (March 2016), stopped altogether.</p><p>That is no longer the case.  From 2022 to 2025, fueled by the Hamas attacks in Israel, incidents and deaths are rising again.  Global networks are recharging.</p><p>This past month alone witnessed the massacre in Australia, targeting Jews at Hanukkah, and disruption of a plot in Los Angeles to detonate bombs in crowds on New Year’s Eve. In Syria last week, ISIS killed two American troops for the first time since 2019. The US responded with strikes against “70+ ISIS targets” in Syria days ago, which begs the question why those targets were not destroyed earlier. The UK’s head of internal security recently described the ISIS threat there as “huge,” and European Union officials said it’s once again “the most prominent threat” in member countries.</p><p>The coming year seems poised to continue this worrying trendline. To reverse it, the US and its partners must strengthen law enforcement cooperation across borders with no tolerance for those who espouse or excuse violence to further a political cause. The counter ISIS coalition is a good model.</p><p>Few issues have risen as quickly — or as decisively — to the top of the global agenda as artificial intelligence. It is poised to stay there. In both Beijing and Washington, AI is viewed as an existential competition — often compared to the Cold War space race — given its military applications and its capacity to transform nearly every domain of national policy.</p><p>In 2025, China surprised the world with the launch of a new frontier reasoning model, DeepSeek R1, which challenged leading American models at a fraction of the cost. It rapidly climbed to the top of Apple’s App Store and briefly rattled financial markets, triggering a sharp Nasdaq dip and a historic one-day loss for a major US chipmaker. Markets recovered — but the surprise was the lesson. The episode underscored how quickly assumed technological advantages can erode.</p><p>The United States has sought to strengthen its position through export controls and an expanding network of partners reliant on US technology for AI adoption. The Trump administration has moved to deepen those partnerships while also proposing to loosen some export restrictions —including to China — a step that has raised bipartisan concern and has yet to be implemented.</p><p>At home, constraints are mounting. The United States lags China in the electricity generation needed to support a rapidly expanding network of data centers, even as power demand surges. Some Democrats have begun calling for limits on new data-center construction altogether. As during the Cold War, global technological competition may increasingly collide with domestic political pressures.</p><p>In 2026, expect growing friction between rapid advances in AI, unsettled policy debates, and intensifying geopolitical rivalry. Together, they are likely to make AI one of the most consequential forces shaping global politics in the years ahead.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

{"details":"<p>The killing of a Hindu man during recent violent protests in Bangladesh has pushed already strained ties between Dhaka and Delhi into a deeper crisis.</p><p>As the two neighbours accuse each other of destabilising relations, questions are growing over whether their once close, time-tested relationship is fraying beyond repair.</p><p>In India, the episode has sparked protests by Hindu nationalist groups. The man who was killed - Dipu Chandra Das, 27 - a member of Bangladesh's Hindu minority, was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob last week in Mymensingh, in northern Bangladesh.</p><p>The incident happened as violent protests broke out over the murder of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent student leader, in the capital, Dhaka.</p><p>Hadi's supporters alleged that the main suspect, who they say is linked to the Awami League - the party of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina - had fled to India, further fuelling anti-India sentiment in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Bangladeshi police, however, said there was no confirmation that the suspect had left the country.</p><p>In recent days, the South Asian neighbours have suspended visa services in several cities, including Delhi, and accused each other of failing to ensure adequate security for their diplomatic missions.</p><p>The two countries have also summoned each other's high commissioners to raise their security concerns.</p><p>\"I sincerely hope tensions don't escalate further on both sides,\" Riva Ganguly Das, a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka, told the BBC, adding that the \"volatile situation\" in Bangladesh made it difficult to predict which way things would go.</p><p>Anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh is not new.</p><p>A section of Bangladeshis has always resented what they see as India's overbearing influence on their country, especially during Hasina's 15-year rule before she was deposed in an uprising last year.</p><p>The anger has grown since Hasina took refuge in India and Delhi, so far, hasn't agreed to send her back despite several requests from Dhaka.</p><p>In the aftermath of Hadi's killing, some young leaders are reported to have made provocative anti-India statements.</p><p>In recent weeks, Bangladeshi security forces had to stop protesters from marching toward the Indian high commission in Dhaka.</p><p>Last week, a mob pelted the Indian assistant high commission building in Chittagong with stones, prompting outrage from Delhi. Police later detained 12 people in connection with the incident, but they were released later without any charge.</p><p>There were counter rallies in India. Bangladesh strongly objected to a protest by a Hindu group outside its diplomatic premises in Delhi, calling it \"unjustifiable\".</p><p>\"I have not seen this kind of suspicion and mistrust between the two sides before,\" Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, said.</p><p>He added that both sides should protect each other's diplomatic missions according to established norms.</p><p>Some readers may find the details below disturbing.</p><p>The brutal lynching of Das, a garment factory worker, has only added to the anger on the Indian side.</p><p>He was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad and was lynched by a mob, who then tied his body to a tree and set it on fire.</p><p>Videos of the killing were widely shared on social media, triggering outrage on both sides of the border.</p><p>Bangladesh's interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, said there was \"no place for such violence in the new Bangladesh\", promising that no one involved in the killing would be spared.</p><p>Bangladeshi police say they have arrested 12 people in connection with the killing of Das.</p><p>Analysts say his killing has once again raised questions over the safety of minorities and civil society activists in Bangladesh, with religious fundamentalists becoming more assertive and intolerant after Hasina's exit.</p><p>Radical Islamists have desecrated hundreds of Sufi shrines, attacked Hindus, prevented women from playing football in some areas and have also curtailed music and cultural shows.</p><p>Human rights groups have also expressed increasing concerns over rising mob violence in Bangladesh in the past year.</p><p>\"Hardline elements of society now see themselves as the mainstream, and they don't want to see pluralism or diversity of thought in the country,\" Asif Bin Ali, a Bangladeshi political analyst, said.</p><p>\"These radical elements are dehumanising people and institutions by setting a narrative that they are pro-India. That gives a green light to others on the ground to attack them.\"</p><p>Many in Bangladesh suspect Islamist radicals to be part of the mob that vandalised and set fire to the buildings of two Bangladesh dailies - The Daily Star and Prothom Alo - and a cultural institution last week, accusing them of being pro-India.</p><p>Civil society activists in Bangladesh have criticised the interim administration for failing to stop the recent violence. Even before the protests, the interim government was under scrutiny as it struggled to maintain law and order and deliver results amid the political turmoil.</p><p>Experts like Ashok Swain argue that right-wing leaders on both sides are making provocative statements for their own benefit, inflaming tension and public anger.</p><p>\"A large section of the Indian media is also playing up events in Bangladesh and portraying that the country is descending into communal chaos,\" says Mr Swain, a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden.</p><p>\"People should realise that stability in Bangladesh is key to India's security, particularly in the north-east,\" he says.</p><p>With the interim administration in Dhaka facing criticism over its lack of control and legitimacy, there is broad consensus that an elected government would be better positioned to address Bangladesh's domestic and foreign challenges.</p><p>The country is scheduled to hold elections on 12 February but until then, Yunus has the difficult task of avoiding further violence.</p><p>With Ms Hasina's Awami League banned from taking part in the polls, it's widely expected that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will emerge as the winner.</p><p>But Islamist political parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami can pose a challenge to the BNP.</p><p>There are worries that there could be more violence in the coming days as hardline religious parties exploit anti-India sentiments.</p><p>\"The biggest victim of this anti-India politics is not India, it's Bangladeshi citizens themselves – like secular minded individuals, centrists and minorities,\" warns Asif Bin Ali.</p><p>He says the current narrative shows that anyone or any institution who criticises fundamentalists can be \"dehumanised by labelling them pro-India, and attacks on them can be justified\".</p><p>Policy makers in India are aware of the changing dynamics in Bangladesh.</p><p>An Indian parliamentary panel said developments in Bangladesh pose \"the greatest strategic challenge\" to Delhi since the country's independence war in 1971.</p><p>Former Bangladeshi diplomats like Humayun Kabir feel that India should accept the ground reality and reach out to Bangladesh to rebuild trust.</p><p>\"We are neighbours and inter-dependent,\" Mr Kabir says.</p><p>Delhi has already indicated that it will engage with an elected government in Bangladesh and that could pave the way for a diplomatic reboot.</p><p>Until then, experts on both sides caution that anger on the street must not be allowed to further strain bilateral ties.</p><p>India’s rural jobs guarantee, a global model, faces controversy as a new law reshapes the original scheme.</p><p>The collision happened early on Saturday in the north-eastern state of Assam, local officials say.</p><p>Lucknow recently joined a select list of global cities recognised for their fine food.</p><p>The fresh protests are sparked by the death of one of the leaders of protests that ousted ex-PM Sheikh Hasina.</p><p>The five cases in Madhya Pradesh state come weeks after a similar incident was reported in Jharkhand state.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The Justice Department has released a new batch of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – documents that include many more mentions of President Donald Trump than last week’s dump.</p><p>DOJ released the initial batch on Friday — the deadline for it to make them public after Congress passed a new law last month — and continues to gradually release additional documents.</p><p>Below are some takeaways from the latest release.</p><p>We’re continuing to learn potentially significant things about the government’s handling of the Epstein investigations.</p><p>The new batch of documents, for example, includes evidence that prosecutors sought to investigate and potentially charge more people.</p><p>A series of apparent FBI emails from July 2019 cite “10 co-conspirators.”</p><p>“When you get a chance can you give me an update on the status of the 10 CO conspirators?” reads one July 7, 2019, email from a sender with “FBI New York” in their signature.</p><p>Another email from two days later requests “an update on the 10 co-conspirators by COB today.”</p><p>A third cites efforts to locate and serve these people with subpoenas. It indicates some were indeed contacted. One who wasn’t is described as “a wealthy business man in Ohio.”</p><p>The documents also cite – but don’t appear to actually include – memos after Epstein’s August 2019 death outlining co-conspirators that could be charged.</p><p>To date, only Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend, have been charged.</p><p>We don’t actually have these memos or the names of the alleged “co-conspirators,” so we don’t know whom these could be in reference to. It’s not clear what kinds of crimes might have been at issue. And while many have been on the hunt for a so-called “client list” that the FBI says doesn’t exist, it’s not clear whether these documents actually implicate others in alleged crimes.</p><p>We don’t know what happened with these potential prosecutions. The fact that the cases were never charged might suggest that the investigations didn’t substantiate such charges. But the use of “co-conspirators” suggests that, at least at one point, investigators felt others were involved in Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>And these are the kinds of documents that lots of people have been anticipating for a very long time – documents that might suggest who else might be held accountable for Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>You can bet there will be lots of pressure on the Trump administration to make sure they get produced.</p><p>Friday’s initial batch included lots of Bill Clinton but not much Trump. This batch features a much heavier dose of the current president.</p><p>And perhaps most notably, the documents show how Trump’s name came up in the context of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s investigations and prosecutions. (Trump has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes, and he has denied any wrongdoing.)</p><p>There is a 2021 subpoena from the Maxwell case to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club seeking “any and all employment records relating to” a redacted individual. (While it’s not clear who the individual is, we’ve known that one of Epstein’s accusers, the late Virginia Giuffre, formerly worked at Mar-a-Lago.)</p><p>There is a 2020 email from an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York noting Trump flew on Epstein’s plane eight times (something that’s since become public knowledge via the release of flight records). The assistant US attorney also says two of the flights included “women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.” At least four of the flights included Maxwell, according to the flight records.</p><p>There are also tips to the FBI involving Trump and his relationship with Epstein, with little or no indication about whether those tips were followed up on or corroborated.</p><p>Aside from those references, the new document dump features an intriguing apparent reference to Trump.</p><p>Included is a letter — which the Justice Department now says is “FAKE” — signed by “J. Epstein” and addressed to another infamous convicted sex offender, disgraced ex-USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.</p><p>“We shared one thing … our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential,” the letter says. “Our President also shares our love of young, nubile girls.”</p><p>The letter then includes another lewd apparent reference to Trump. (It doesn’t use the word Trump, but it’s from 2019, when Trump was serving as president.)</p><p>It then suggests that, unlike Trump, “we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair.”</p><p>Notably, the letter is postmarked three days after Epstein’s death in prison, which has been ruled a suicide. The author alludes to having “taken the ‘short route’ home,” and wishes Nassar, “Good luck!” The letter was marked as “return to sender.”</p><p>What to make of this? There are so many questions that are unanswered here.</p><p>DOJ said Tuesday afternoon the FBI had determined the letter was “FAKE,” in part because the writing didn’t appear to match Epstein’s. (An FBI document from 2020 indicates a handwriting analysis had been requested, but the documents released Tuesday don’t include the results.)</p><p>The DOJ statement also noted the letter was postmarked in Virginia, while Epstein had been held in New York; the return address listed the wrong jail; and it was processed three days after Epstein died.</p><p>Even if this letter were indeed from Epstein, it would just be a claim.</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, the DOJ didn’t invoke this letter specifically but broadly suggested the allegations raised against Trump – likely including the FBI tips mentioned above – weren’t true.</p><p>“Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the DOJ said. “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”</p><p>CNN has reached out to the White House about the latest batch of documents, including that letter.</p><p>But there are just too many unanswered questions about this letter to draw definitive conclusions.</p><p>At the very least, the new disclosures are the kinds of things Trump once indicated he worried would unnecessarily tarnish people.</p><p>Trump in a 2024 Fox News interview cautioned about “phony stuff” in the Epstein files that had the potential to “affect people’s lives.” He echoed that Monday night, warning that merely being in a picture with Epstein could ruin someone’s reputation.</p><p>The release of these materials previously has been marred by DOJ mishandling, and that’s continuing.</p><p>First, DOJ’s initial Tuesday statement is extraordinary. It reads as if it’s from Trump’s personal lawyer – i.e. its reference to how this information, if credible, “certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump” – rather than a neutral handler of this information.</p><p>That’s a huge contrast to how the DOJ handled Clinton’s appearance in the files released Friday. Back then, a DOJ spokesperson pointed to an image of Clinton appearing in a hot tub with a redacted individual and suggestively labeled the redacted person a “victim” of Epstein’s abuse.</p><p>Clinton, like Trump, has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein. On Monday – before the latest batch was released — the former president’s spokesman encouraged DOJ to release everything it has related to Clinton, claiming that “selective releases” were about “insinuation,” not transparency.</p><p>The DOJ’s questionable handling of the files has also been underscored by the curious and heavy-handed redactions that go beyond the limits of the law Congress passed last month.</p><p>The 2020 email from the assistant US attorney redacts the author’s name, for instance. Other emails appear to redact the names of government officials, meaning it’s not clear which officials were involved in key decisions and discussions – including emails from around the time of Epstein’s much-criticized non-prosecution deal in the late 2000s.</p><p>And lastly, the documents were apparently uploaded Monday, then removed, then reposted again, according to The Washington Post.</p><p>It’s not clear why that happened or whether the documents that were reposted match the ones that had been initially been posted.</p><p>The Justice Department has already failed to comply with the deadline to release all of these documents, which were due in their totality on Friday.</p><p>And after that initial release, it briefly pulled back some documents that had been posted, including one image that featured a photo of Trump, which was later restored.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said the photo was removed due to caution about potentially featuring an Epstein victim.</p><p>“It has nothing to do with President Trump,” Blanche said this weekend. “The absurdity of pulling down a single photo because of President Trump is laughable.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been permitted to leave prison to undergo surgery on Christmas Day following approval from Brazil's Supreme Court, court documents show.</p><p>Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the last election in 2022.</p><p>Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday granted permission for Bolsonaro to temporarily leave prison and be transferred to a hospital on Wednesday for a hernia operation on 25 December.</p><p>Bolsonaro, 70, has faced ongoing health complications since being stabbed in the abdomen during a 2018 presidential campaign.</p><p>In April, the right-wing former president underwent intestinal surgery.

And if you take a look at Greenland, there are Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. So, we need this for protection.\"</p><p>He also chastised Denmark for what he described neglecting the territory, \"they have spent no money, they have no military protection, they say Denmark arrived there 300 years ago with boats - we were there with boats too, I'm sure. We'll have to work it all out.\"</p><p>Adding to the European voices pushing back on the US ambitions and the criticism of Denmark, Commission Ursula von der Leyen insisted that “territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law”.

{"details":"<p>UN experts and 400 prominent women have urged Iran not to execute Zahra Tabari, a 67-year-old electrical engineer and women's rights activist.</p><p>Ms Tabari was arrested in April and accused of collaborating with a banned opposition group, the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI), according to her family.</p><p>In October, she was convicted of \"armed rebellion\" by a Revolutionary Court in Rasht after a trial via video link that lasted less than 10 minutes. Her family said the verdict was based on extremely limited and unreliable evidence: a piece of cloth bearing the words \"Woman, Resistance, Freedom\", and an unpublished audio message.</p><p>Iranian authorities have not yet commented on the case.</p><p>At least 51 other people are known to be facing the death penalty in Iran after being convicted of national security offences including armed rebellion, as well as \"enmity against God\", \"corruption on Earth\" and espionage, according to the UN experts.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Council's special rapporteurs on human rights in Iran, violence against women and arbitrary executions, as well as the five members of the working group on discrimination against women and girls, warned in a joint statement that Ms Tabari's case showed \"a pattern of serious violations of international human rights law\".</p><p>She was arrested during a raid on her home without a judicial warrant, and was interrogated for a month while held in solitary confinement and pressured to confess to taking up arms against the state and to membership in an opposition group, according to the experts.</p><p>Ms Tabari was denied access to a lawyer of her choosing and was represented by a court-appointed lawyer, they said, adding that her death sentence was issued immediately after a brief hearing.</p><p>\"The severe procedural violations in this case - including the unlawful deprivation of her liberty, the denial of effective legal representation, the extraordinarily brief trial, the lack of adequate time to prepare a defence, and the use of evidence that appears insufficient to support a charge of [armed rebellion] - render any resulting conviction unsafe,\" they said.</p><p>They also noted that international law restricted the death penalty to the most serious crimes, meaning intentional killing.</p><p>\"To execute Tabari under these circumstances would constitute arbitrary execution,\" the experts added. \"Criminalising women's activism for gender equality and treating such expression as evidence of armed rebellion constitutes a grave form of gender discrimination.\"</p><p>More than 400 prominent women - including several Nobel laureates, the former presidents of Switzerland and Ecuador, and former prime ministers of Finland, Peru, Poland and Ukraine - also signed a public appeal for Ms Tabari's immediate release on Tuesday.</p><p>\"Iran is today the world's number one executioner of women per capita. Zahra's case lays bare this terror: in Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death,\" it said.</p><p>The appeal was organised by Justice for the Victims of the 1988 Massacre in Iran, a UK-based group that represents the families of the thousands of political prisoners who were executed in Iran three decades ago.</p><p>Another Iranian woman, Kurdish rights activist and social worker Pakhshan Azizi, is also facing the death penalty on the same charge as Ms Tabari.</p><p>UN experts have previously said Ms Azizi's sentencing appeared to be \"solely related to her legitimate work as a social worker, including her support for refugees in Iraq and Syria\".</p><p>According to Iran Human Rights (IHR), at least 1,426 people - including 41 women - were executed in Iran in the first 11 months of 2025 - a 70% increase on the same period last year.</p><p>Almost half of those put to death as of the end of November were convicted of drug-related offences, while 53 were convicted of national security offences, the Norway-based group said.</p><p>The changes to the judgement, which was also amended last week, are described as clerical mistakes, errors or omissions.</p><p>At least 347 people have now been put to death this year, according to the UK-based campaign group Reprieve.</p><p>Nurse Sandie Peggie complained about a transgender doctor using a female changing room in a Fife hospital.</p><p>The country lags behind when it comes to women in leadership positions.</p><p>Images appeared online of unveiled women competing in the race on Friday.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The Justice Department’s leadership asked career prosecutors in Florida to volunteer over the “next several days” to help redact the Epstein files, in the latest Trump administration push toward releasing the hundreds of thousands of photos, internal memos and other evidence around the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>A supervising prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida’s US Attorney’s Office emailed the entire district office on Tuesday — two days before Christmas — announcing an “emergency request from the [Deputy Attorney General’s] office the SDFL must assist with,” according to a copy of the email reviewed by CNN. “We need AUSAs to do remote document review and redactions related to the Epstein files,” the email said.</p><p>The email raises the possibility of more Epstein files being released over the coming days, including the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. It also underlines the public and political backlash the Justice Department has faced since the deadline passed on Friday to release all documents in the federal government’s possession, as mandated by an act of Congress calling for transparency around Epstein files. The Justice Department acknowledged it had not gotten through redacting many of the files by Friday and has continued to release documents this week.</p><p>Extreme redactions undercut Epstein files release</p><p>The Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions from CNN about the email on Tuesday.</p><p>The Christmas-week request, from a top career prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office, attempts to entice volunteer attorneys to work on the files now, in exchange for days off later. It’s also possible that the call for volunteers frustrates busy career Justice Department employees after a year of departures and firings across the ranks by Trump administration leadership, as well as several in-court incidents that have hurt the department’s reputation in the legal community.</p><p>“I am aware that the timing could not be worse,” the US Attorney’s Office leadership wrote on Tuesday. “For some the holidays are about to begin, but I know that for others the holidays are coming to an end.”</p><p>The Justice Department was using hundreds of lawyers at its headquarters, especially national security specialists, to process the files over the past month, picking up a project the FBI and other agencies had worked on in slivers previously. The Tuesday request appears to seek to add lawyers to the project, more than a month after Congress passed the transparency act and President Donald Trump signed it into law.</p><p>The redaction guidelines provided by the department have been described by some sources familiar with them as being as being confusing or overly cautious on what is being redacted.</p><p>And the department also failed to meet the deadline, only releasing on Friday a portion of the files — many of which had already been in the public domain. Overnight, the Department released nearly 30,000 more records that contained many more new documents such as a prosecutor email noting Trump’s name on flight logs found in the criminal investigation of Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, and the paperwork documenting investigative subpoenas and interviews in 2019 through 2021, when Maxwell was convicted for sex trafficking minors.</p><p>Trump has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes, and he has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>“We have an obligation to the public to release these documents and before we can do so, certain redactions must be made to protect the identity of the victims, among other things,” the Southern District of Florida leadership wrote in the email asking for volunteers on the Epstein redactions on Tuesday.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>The real summit started the night before European leaders descended at the Europa building last Thursday for their final gathering of the year. As it often is the case in Brussels, the ordre du jour was only indicative, and the real business was done on the sidelines.</p><p>On the table was an innovative plan to issue a reparations loan for Kyiv based on immobilised Russian assets held mostly in Belgium. It was an option preferred by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen; the resistance from the Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever was the main obstacle, but not the only one.</p><p>In the end, the EU agreed on a very different solution and abandoned the reparations loan. This is an account on how the deal was made.</p><p>On Wednesday night, EU leaders and their counterparts from candidate countries hoping to join the bloc gathered for a working dinner.</p><p>While the event was ostensibly focused on enlargement, the real question weighing on leaders' minds was the future of Ukraine and how to keep the country financially afloat as negotiations for peace drag on and the US pulls back.</p><p>That same night, von der Leyen, Merz and de Wever excused themselves from the EU-Western Balkans dinner to take a sideline meeting about the reparations loan.</p><p>The Belgian prime minister – angered by his portrayal as a Russian asset in some media– was clear that Ukraine had to receive a financial lifeline, but that it shouldn't come at his country's sole expense or risk jeopardising the Belgian financial sector and, possibly, the eurozone.</p><p>By the time of the Wednesday night sideline discussion, de Wever could tell that the wind was changing. Italy had come out in his favour, requesting that different options be explored, with Rome growing louder about the knock-on effects the reparations loan could have.</p><p>Fuelling those concerns was a report by credit rating agency Fitch had put Euroclear, the depository holding the Russian frozen assets in Belgium, on negative watch, citing liquidity and legal risks. One diplomat told Euronews that Euroclear was at the centre of discussions. The thing about market forces, the official explained, is that once they are unleashed, they take a life of their own and cannot be controlled.</p><p>The reparation loan's backers insisted there would be no confiscation of the Russian assets and that risks for Belgium would be sufficiently covered, but it wasn't clear that the markets would agree. For Bercy, France's powerful finance ministry, that risk could not be ignored.</p><p>\"The idea of systemic risk is no joke,\" one diplomat said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán teased his Belgian counterpart, saying he would be submitted to torture. Orbán also created confusion after he declared that the reparations loan had been removed from the points of discussion for the summit.</p><p>Officials denied his comments and even his Slovak ally Robert Fico joked in remarks to Euronews that his friend Viktor appeared confused about the order of the day at the summit. \"The reparations loan is all we will talk about,\" he said.</p><p>But Orbán, who relishes in his image of enfant terrible but is also the most senior head of state in the European Council and knows the Brussels machine well, was on to something.</p><p>The summit started with a dramatic declaration by von der Leyen: EU leaders would not exit the building until a solution on how to fund Ukraine was found. Among the Brussels press, speculation swirled that the summit could go well into the weekend, reminiscent of a four-day summit which saw a deal on a post-pandemic recovery plan in 2020.</p><p>Behind closed doors, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the 27. He told leaders that Russia, as the aggressor, should pay for the damage done to his country, and referred to the reparations loan as a \"smart and fair approach.\"</p><p>After making his case, Zelenskyy left the assembled leaders to discuss the fate of the reparation loans behind closed doors. He employed a much more severe tone at the press conference that followed his intervention in the room, warning that without a cash injection by the spring at the latest, Ukraine's war effort would be dented.</p><p>By the start of dinner, the reparations loan was the main subject of discussion. Von der Leyen, Merz and Frederiksen all spoke about the merits of the proposal, arguing it would keep Ukraine well-funded and that Russia would have to pay for the damage under the principle of \"you break it, you pay\".</p><p>Politically, the optics of the reparations loan were good too as it meant that the bulk of the financing would not fall on the European taxpayer, which von der Leyen had argued would be very hard to understand for the European public opinion.</p><p>As different leaders around the table asked for time to speak, Giorgia Meloni made a long intervention casting doubt on the plan, described as detailed and well-thought out by people familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Orbán also spoke against it, while a Belgian demand for unlimited guarantees raised eyebrows, with other leaders aware that they would have to ask permission of their national parliaments to commit to something they could not even quantify.</p><p>At that point, it became clear to Council President António Costa that the reparations loan had hit a wall, and it was time to bring out plan B – which also came with strings attached.</p><p>Costa reminded leaders that the Commission had presented an alternative to cover the €90 billion Ukraine would need for next year and 2027 through joint borrowing backed by the EU budget. It would require a unanimous vote; Costa suggested that provided Orbán would not veto it, plan B was on the table.</p><p>\"Costa understood the reparation loan was stuck and he took the lead, as von der Leyen couldn't, to activate the plan B,\" a diplomat said. \"That changed the course of the night.\"</p><p>With plan B in the open, Orbán huddled with his Czech counterpart Andrej Babiš and Slovak prime minister Robert Fico at the Hungarian room in the Council building.</p><p>Poland aside, it marked something of a resurrection for the Visegrad format, which had been moribund since the start of the Ukraine war due to divergences among its members over how to treat Russia, especially between Budapest and Warsaw.</p><p>Euronews was the first to report at midnight that Orbán, Babiš and Fico were meeting privately to discuss a way for the EU to issue joint debt without their input; countries willing to pay up for Kyiv would pay in, while the three of them would get an opt-out.</p><p>The Euronews report was confirmed three hours later in the summit conclusions.</p><p>A personal familiar with the talks said it was Babiš who floated the idea of using \"enhanced cooperation\" as foreseen in the EU treaties. Orbán posted a picture of the three's meeting on social media, and Babiš posted his own confirmation on X telling his followers \"keep your fingers crossed for me that it turns out well.\"</p><p>Once their agreement was established, and with the legal proposal in writing, the summit moved fast towards a deal. Two diplomats told Euronews that \"nothing was promised\" in exchange for Orbán lifting his veto. One source explained that while the Hungarian prime minister is deeply sceptical of Zelenskyy and his government, it is not in his interest to have Ukraine collapse – and his country heads to the polls in April.</p><p>As Orbán exited the summit, he lifted his hands in front of reporters. \"We are innocent.\"</p><p>With the deal done, it was time for the politics.</p><p>Belgian PM de Wever celebrated a victory for Ukraine, Europe and international law. “Everyone can leave this meeting victorious. Funding Ukraine is not charity, it is the most important investment we can make in our own security,” he said.</p><p>De Wever had held his ground, understanding that resistance to the reparation loan went further than Brussels and riding a wave of cross-party and public support in Belgium.</p><p>Costa, meanwhile, said the EU had promised to back Ukraine and had now proved it was able to do so.</p><p>For von der Leyen and Merz, however, the optics look far more complicated. The Commission president had been sidelined in negotiations during the night as the talks moved away from the reparations loan. To the leaders who wanted a different solution, Costa seemed a more honest broker than von der Leyen, seen as too close to Berlin.</p><p>\"It was awkward,\" said one official.</p><p>As for Merz, who had lobbied intensively both publicly and privately for the reparations loan, the outcome was a cold shower at an EU summit – the biggest European stage a head of state can hope for. The German chancellor had failed to read the room and ended up with a solution Berlin had long campaigned against: more EU borrowing.</p><p>It was also a disappointment for Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister hosting the rotating presidency of the EU on its final summit. At a press conference after the meeting, she conceded she had “backed one solution, the result turned out reasonably well”. As she took questions from reporters, her body language was severe.</p><p>For everyone to save face, the conclusions included a line suggesting that the immobilised Russian assets could be used in the future but not specifying how. It is also difficult to see how Ukraine will ever pay the €90 billion back if Moscow doesn’t pay reparations one way or the other.</p><p>But perhaps the most important development of the night is that EU leaders were able to make a consequential decision without unanimity. The fact that Ukraine’s funding will be secured through common borrowing among 24 member states, bypassing national vetoes, is nothing short of extraordinary. And it shows that the EU, for all its rigidity, can still find a way forward.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Exclusive: How the deal to get Ukraine a €90 billion EU loan was made","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/12/23/exclusive-how-the-deal-to-get-ukraine-a-90-billion-eu-loan-was-sealed","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T12:32:50.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Messages reveal how the agency has raced to satisfy the White House by pumping out videos of confrontations and arrests.</p><p>For the Immigration and Customs Enforcement public affairs team, the nighttime operation across metro Houston in October was a gold mine.</p><p>An ICE video producer shadowed agents as they pulled over and handcuffed more than 120 suspected undocumented immigrants, then sent the footage to a private team chatroom.</p><p>ICE official 1</p><p>Oct. 29, 2:10 p.m.</p><p>Arrests are wonderful!</p><p>ICE video producer 1</p><p>Oct. 29, 2:13 p.m.</p><p>Great shooting!</p><p>Across thousands of internal ICE messages reviewed by The Washington Post, this kind of celebration has become commonplace. The messages show how the team has worked closely with the White House, which has urged them to produce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.</p><p>Before officials could post the Houston video, they had to figure out how to frame it. Officials did not know if all the arrestees had criminal records, they wrote in the chats, undermining a slogan the team had worked to promote on social media: that ICE targeted the “Worst of the Worst.”</p><p>ICE video producer 2</p><p>Oct. 29, 2:36 p.m.</p><p>We made several dozen arrests today very quickly. Not sure if these all had criminal histories beyond being in the US illegally.</p><p>After some discussion, the team decided on a compromise.</p><p>ICE official 2</p><p>Oct. 29, 6:30 p.m.</p><p>I’d like to try to put this out without focusing on the aliens or their crimes, but to demonstrate that we’re out working hard.</p><p>Instead of arguing they’d snared hardened criminals, officials wrote a caption saying the arrests showed the dangers of “illegal aliens … behind the wheel.”</p><p>Then, to maximize the video’s chances of going viral, they needed a soundtrack.</p><p>ICE video producer 1</p><p>Oct. 30, 1:13 p.m.</p><p>think country songs... this is Houston after all.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>Oct. 30, 1:39 p.m.</p><p>I feel like we need something a little more hard-core</p><p>They settled on a rap song by Nbhd Nick, which his label would later tell The Post was used without permission, that starts, “Oh, you thought this was a game, huh?”</p><p>The video was posted to ICE’s social media channels, where it has been viewed more than 1 million times in total.</p><p>For years, this ICE team had run like a routine government communications shop, dispensing public service announcements and news releases few Americans would see. But during President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE’s public affairs arm has rapidly transformed into an influencer-style media machine, churning out flashy videos of tactical operations and immigration raids.</p><p>The internal communications reviewed by The Post show how the ICE team has coordinated with the White House, working to satisfy Trump aides’ demands to “flood the airwaves,” as one official urged in the messages, with brash content showing immigrants being chased, grabbed and detained.</p><p>They also show federal officials mocking immigrants in crass terms and discussing video edits that might help legitimize the administration’s aggressive stance. The team also knowingly used copyright-protected music without permission from the rights holders, among other techniques designed to boost their online attention.</p><p>Six current or former officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, told The Post that the video effort had broken from the more careful and methodical work of past administrations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.</p><p>The Post reviewed chats and other materials provided by people familiar with internal discussions. They did so on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the disclosures.</p><p>David Lapan, the first DHS press secretary during Trump’s first term and a longtime critic who has argued the second Trump administration politicized the agency, said the current strategy is unrecognizable compared to the more “professional and buttoned-up” operations under past presidents that worked to describe law enforcement activities clinically and apolitically, for fear of inflaming anger against agents in the field.</p><p>“We were supposed to present the facts, not hype things up. But this veers into propaganda, into creating fear,” said Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel. “We didn’t have this meme-ification of various serious operations, these things that are life or death. … It’s not a joking matter. But that’s the way they’re treating it now.”</p><p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “President Trump and his entire team are working at breakneck speed to keep our promises, deport criminal illegal aliens, and get information out to the public — that’s a good thing and the American people deserve no less.”</p><p>DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the White House had given the communications wings of DHS and ICE “autonomy to create content that is effectively reaching the American public.” The social media posts that used copyrighted material without permission had been preapproved by administration lawyers, she said.</p><p>DHS public affairs officials, she added, were proud to break with the strategies of past administrations because their work has proved more successful at getting people’s attention.</p><p>“They were irrelevant,” she said, “and we’ve made it matter.”</p><p>Launched after the Sept. 11 attacks, ICE and DHS had always functioned as traditional law enforcement agencies focused on public safety and with minimal tools for self-promotion.</p><p>Their public affairs divisions employed small teams of video producers, mostly for unexceptional tasks: facilitating TV interviews, running the cameras at workforce retirement ceremonies, recording safety commercials for the Super Bowl. Some producers traveled to make videos when DHS agents took down sex abusers or crime rings. Video producers would film targeted operations, a current DHS official said, but immigration enforcement was only a fraction of the workload.</p><p>After the start of Trump’s second term, however, ICE’s ranks swelled as federal agents were diverted to immigration enforcement and the One Big Beautiful Bill tripled the agency’s annual budget to deliver on the White House’s promises to secure the southern border and speed up deportations. ICE’s average arrest count jumped from around 300 a day last year to more than 800 a day since Trump took office, according to a Post analysis of ICE data released by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p>DHS’s media operation was no exception. Public affairs teams were injected with a new crew of political appointees who had orders from the White House to treat immigration as their top priority and produce dramatized visuals of ICE operations and arrests to command user attention, the current and former officials told The Post. The video teams’ workload exploded, and immigration became the only topic anyone could pursue, according to interviews.</p><p>“We’re not doing child pornography cases. We’re not doing human trafficking cases,” one current DHS official told The Post. “Everything is immigration.”</p><p>ICE’s public affairs team included several dozen public affairs officers, producers and strategists, scattered between its Washington headquarters and local field offices across the country, current DHS officials said. Members of ICE’s visual communications team, embedded in the public affairs division and known as “viscom,” began recording in the field more frequently, accompanying officers on raids and removal operations, shooting video day and night, interviews and chats showed. Any video producer who witnessed a particularly cinematic scene was expected to alert their supervisors, so the agency and the White House could promote it on their social media channels. Employees on ICE’s “digital engagement” team then raced to edit and post the footage on social media in hopes of securing a viral win.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE’s assistant director for public affairs, frequently requested “good arrest videos” and asked the team to devote its energy to capturing “high profile arrests,” the internal messages show. Laszlo Baksay, a deputy assistant director, asked the public affairs team in the chat to flag stories where “aliens with criminal history are being employed,” to counter media reports that the agency was grabbing “ordinary aliens just trying to earn a living.”</p><p>Covington and Baksay declined to comment further on the chat messages.</p><p>The team began working like a professional influencer operation, creating a “social media check list” of caught-on-camera arrests, sharing metrics with senior officials, using paid social media tracking tools and cataloguing all of their Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads and X posts, ranked by impressions and engagement rate.</p><p>Covington pushed the team in internal chats in late May to be more “proactive” in pushing out videos.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>May 21, 7:52 p.m.</p><p>What PR tactics can we deploy that we don’t typically? Should we feed info to an influencer? ... Using judgment to ID something likely to go viral or bubble up and gain attention. Right now we are learning from the media, let’s feed the beast first with the good work ICE is doing each and every day.</p><p>A week after Covington’s message, in late May, the team got its first viral video. The clip showed ICE agents leaping out of an SUV and confronting men on the curb of a home improvement store in Baltimore. The men were shoved face down onto the street and handcuffed while an agent said, “Calle la boca” — in Spanish, “shut your mouth.” In an X post, ICE called the video “action-packed.”</p><p>ICE official 3</p><p>May 28, 11:57 a.m.</p><p>2.1M views and nearly 7,000 shares in 13 hours! Awesome work!</p><p>But the real celebration came shortly after, when the White House reposted the video on its Instagram and X accounts, labeling it an “EPIC Takedown.”</p><p>ICE official 4</p><p>May 28, 3:22 p.m.</p><p>White House just ran with it!</p><p>The post, from one of the team’s political appointees, led to a burst of hearts and shock-face emojis.</p><p>As the media operation ramped up, DHS posted several videos containing clear errors around their operations, using misleading footage that showed scenes recorded thousands of miles away from where the video described, The Post has previously reported.</p><p>Other edits were aimed at presenting events in ways that supported the administration’s narratives. In May, Covington asked, at the White House’s request, whether a video of a deportation flight from Texas could be re-edited so that the clips “don’t feature tons of females?” An ICE official responded that a video producer would “re-edit the b-roll to exclude the females,” the chats show.</p><p>Officials worked to find ways to describe many of the people arrested as the “Worst of the Worst,” a slogan DHS and ICE began using in January to argue that their agents hunted only the most dangerous criminals. When one official asked in the chat what producers should say in their videos when arrestees had no criminal history, another responded that they should work to find something else “newsworthy” to highlight, like an “egregious immigration history.”</p><p>Public affairs officers were told to rewrite their news releases and online posts with stronger, more aggressive language if they wanted the agency’s main communications channels to promote them, one said in an interview. “If the truth of the operation does not match the narrative of the ‘worst of the worst,’ it’s going to be killed,” the official said.</p><p>The team gave right-wing media figures premium access to immigration operations and received favorable coverage. In June, about three months before he was killed, right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk posted what he said was “exclusive footage” of ICE officials arresting a “thug.” Covington highlighted the moment in the team’s chat, thanking one official “for getting great footage on today’s arrest.”</p><p>Right-wing influencers with large followings, including “Dr. Phil” McGraw and Libs of TikTok’s Chaya Raichik, were regularly invited to ride along with law enforcement agents and interview senior officials, according to The Post’s review of their coverage. The pro-Trump influencer Benny Johnson donned a Border Patrol tactical vest to watch a raid at a Walmart in the Chicago area alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem. His X clip celebrating the “amazing” operation’s “wild scenes” has been viewed 1.6 million times.</p><p>A Libs of TikTok representative declined to comment on the relationship. Representatives for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of McGraw said he had been invited by White House border czar Tom Homan to document ICE enforcement in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year.</p><p>In pursuit of more viral video, DHS brought in new public affairs staff members with atypical backgrounds and authorized them to “go out and capture content,” as a chat message said. A MAGA women’s lifestyle influencer, an L.A.-based wedding videographer and a Canadian-born actor who played a “mountain man” in a cable-TV show joined the team.</p><p>DHS encouraged the hires to become intimately involved with agency affairs, the chats and interviews showed. In June, when ICE agents were raiding farms in rural Missouri, the former actor noted it would be a prime chance to make a video. “Would be great to get something like that on film,” he wrote in the chats, suggesting a tagline: “We are everywhere, we will find you.”</p><p>Later, when ICE officials complained about negative media coverage, he worked to bolster their spirits.</p><p>ICE official 4</p><p>June 20, 12:18 p.m.</p><p>The good news is half the country is seeing it, and equally as frustrated. those in the “middle” are who we will continue to slowly reach... It’s a war!</p><p>By June, the public affairs team had for weeks been showing signs of overwork, with some employees consistently working overtime to help satisfy the White House’s constant demands for more content, the chat messages showed.</p><p>The team had discussed bringing on contract videographers to help address outstanding tasks — like a new request to shadow every operation of ICE’s Special Response Team, the elite SWAT-like unit that handles its most dangerous arrests.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>May, 9 10:42 a.m.</p><p>All- as expected, I am getting pressure now about our video capabilities. I need ALL video our PAOs and videographers have captured this week ASAP in one link. This should be the only priority for right now.</p><p>But when protests over mass deportation swept L.A. and Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard in June, the White House ramped up the pressure yet again. Top officials wanted ICE’s public affairs unit to produce more visuals, messages from June 10 show.</p><p>ICE official 5</p><p>June 10, 12:33 p.m.</p><p>We need all hands on deck to start “flooding the airwaves” per White house direction on ALL ICE arrests nationwide today. The request is to flood social and traditional media with imagery of ICE arrests.</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:41 p.m.</p><p>How many socials do we have in the que that we paused from the last 2 days?</p><p>ICE official 6</p><p>June 10, 12:42 p.m.</p><p>“TONS”</p><p></p><p></p><p>He said there’s stuff loaded and ready to go</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:42 p.m.</p><p>do we have enough to post every 30 mins? Until midnight?</p><p>The National Guard deployment presented a challenge for a unit trained to cover preplanned and targeted operations: a vast, citywide video shoot where clashes with protesters could flare up at any time.</p><p>In the chats, the team strategized how to stretch out its content.</p><p>ICE official 5</p><p>June 10, 12:45 p.m.</p><p>My thought would be for locals to post and the HQ can re-tweet, unless there is something really juicy that would get more push coming from HQ.</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:50 p.m.</p><p>fire away!</p><p>Around 1 p.m., Covington, the ICE public affairs assistant director, instructed her team to highlight arrests in Los Angeles at the White House’s request.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>June 10, 1:18 p.m.</p><p>On White House Call - we need to be highlighting worst of worst LA arrests across relevant accounts/channels. I will be getting a LOT of content from all federal partners today. All flowing through me now.</p><p>ICE began to post a flurry of tweets on X in quick succession — almost every half hour. They included visuals of recent immigration raids and mug shots of people the agency said were undocumented immigrants with a criminal history.</p><p>ICE tweeted 38 times over 11 hours. Earlier in the day, the account had posted only three times.</p><p>Officials also floated more ideas to maximize coverage, including pulling in military videographers, known as “combat cameras,” to offer “direct support of designated hotspots.” One official warned the idea came with too many risks, in part because they had been trained for battle, not protests. “It’s different than war photography in a few distinct ways,” the official said.</p><p>The White House directive around the L.A. protests forced the agency to play more of an “attack-dog” role online to keep up with the administration’s demands, one former worker on the DHS media team told The Post.</p><p>“That was the turning point to get even more aggressive with their messaging, and to paint pictures of these places as war-torn,” he said. “There was a much more blustery edge, and a need to put stuff out as quickly as you can. You’re steamrolling everything.”</p><p>The White House has benefited from this symbiotic relationship: The most-watched video on its TikTok account, with more than 45 million views, included DHS operational footage, a photo of a crying arrestee and the caption, “Ahhh that deportation feeling …” (It has since been removed, but the White House declined to say why.)</p><p>In the weeks after the June 10 directive, many National Guard troops left L.A., but the ICE public affairs team kept working at a rapid pace, the chats showed. As plainclothes ICE agents began ramping up arrests of immigrants at courthouses, an ICE official urged the team to “flood all your local social with the imagery from the arrests!”</p><p>The pace became so demanding that one official complained of overwork.</p><p>ICE official 7</p><p>June 20, 11:53 a.m.</p><p>DHS knows we have very little staff right? I know it has been discussed but there has been no change to our staffing and they keep wanting more and more.</p><p>When video producers weren’t available, public affairs officers were sent into the field to record ICE activities on their phones — a footage “force multiplier,” one DHS official said in an interview. Officers were traveling more to fill the White House’s almost insatiable demand for visuals, another official said.</p><p>The push, however, left some of the officials fearful for their safety in the field. In July, DHS said, an ICE public affairs specialist was sent to the emergency room with a bloodied hand after being hit by a thrown rock outside a California marijuana farm.</p><p>During an all-team meeting attended by public affairs officers, an official said he had been sent in a T-shirt to scenes where agents were wearing body armor, an ICE official recalled. (An ICE spokesman said the agency now ensures that public affairs officials have protective equipment, including body armor and first aid kits.)</p><p>Still, public affairs officials have participated in the immigration operations. In September, Covington said in an internal chat message that she had been on a ride-along with federal agents when an immigrant from Venezuela was apprehended. “Target was a runner - I spotted him and we made the arrest,” she wrote.</p><p>She uploaded photos of the man in handcuffs and asked in the chat whether he had been a known gang member, saying he “had some interesting tats.” An ICE legal associate told her their files showed no evidence of gang membership. Some of her colleagues congratulated her nonetheless. “Go [Public Affairs Office] Go!” one replied.</p><p>The White House’s frenzy for more content, and DHS officials’ scramble to produce, led the team to push the boundaries in ways that disturbed some of its employees.</p><p>ICE’s X account posted a video of a bound protester in Portland, Ore., being wheeled into custody face down on a flatbed cart, with the background lyrics, “they see me rollin’.” DHS’s account posted a clip of Illinois protesters and said, “Get a job you imbecilic morons.” It also shared a Halloween-styled montage of arrestees’ mug shots and warned there would be “no sanctuary for creatures & criminals of the night.”</p><p>“They just went nuts,” a recently departed DHS producer told The Post. “It was no limit. … It was like if someone from Reddit took over.”</p><p>Some prosecutors in U.S. attorneys’ offices complained to public affairs officials that the brash social media posts could jeopardize their cases by raising questions about bias or tainting the jury pool, one official said. (McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said she’d not heard this and said that if officials are so concerned about it, they should convey it to her, not journalists.)</p><p>But that style of crass humor was also common in the ICE team’s internal chats. Four days after Trump’s inauguration, an official shared a meme that read like a warning to migrants inside the country: “Hide Yo Wife. Hide Yo Kids.” Another official poked fun at a migrant’s mug shot, labeling him an “MS13 heart throb” in reference to the gang.</p><p>In June, after Los Angeles Dodgers officials said they had blocked ICE agents from accessing their parking lots, one ICE official made a joke about the team’s Japanese superstar pitcher, who has played for American teams since 2018.</p><p>ICE official 8</p><p>June 20, 11:41 a.m.</p><p>Can we double check Shohei Ohtani’s immigration paperwork???</p><p>McLaughlin said that every organization has “conversations that you don’t think are going to get out to the public” but that she is not “going to lose sleep over” anything in the messages.</p><p>ICE’s shifting attitude toward public messaging was especially noticeable in its use of music without the artists’ or labels’ permission, current and former DHS officials said, which past administrations had been far more cautious about. Some officials said in the chat that they were indifferent to the potential perils. When one employee raised concerns about copyright violations, another wrote back, dismissing them.</p><p>At least five DHS and ICE videos have been taken down from X in recent months following complaints from representatives of the comedian Theo Von, the band MGMT, and rappers Jay-Z, Joey Valence, and Chamillionaire. Other companies and creators have complained that their intellectual property was used without permission, including the Pokémon Co., whose cartoon style was mimicked for a DHS video captioned “Gotta Catch ’Em All.”</p><p>Trump administration officials have defended the intensity of their media operation to reporters by saying it’s what Americans want: visual proof that Trump is fulfilling his promise to deport millions of immigrants nationwide.</p><p>But ICE’s social media onslaught appears to have done little to change Americans’ attitudes en masse. The share of Americans saying immigration is a good thing for the country leaped to 79 percent in July, a record high, a Gallup poll found in July. About 62 percent of Americans said they disliked how Trump was handling the issue.</p><p>Despite this, the media operations at DHS show no signs of slowing down. Inside the ICE team, the chats showed, many were proud of their work — and committed for the long haul.</p><p>In August, after an ICE official shared census numbers showing the country’s immigrant population had dropped by 2 million, an ICE legal associate responded simply: “Only 40 million to go.”</p><p>About this story</p><p>Videos from ICEGov/X.

Already in January this cluster will be launched,\" Interior and Administration Minister Marcin Kierwiński said during a press briefing in Ozierany.</p><p>Kierwiński and Prime Minister Donald Tusk also visited the Border Guard post in Bobrowniki on Tuesday as part of the latest phase of strengthening security along the Polish-Belarusian border.</p><p>The tower in Ozierany is one of five such structures built in recent months. They have been installed along the Svisloch and Istoczanka rivers, among other locations. The total investment cost was approximately 47 million zloty (€£11.1 million).</p><p>More than 4,000 soldiers and several hundred Border Guard and police officers will spend Christmas Eve on duty, Tusk said.</p><p>\"In total, more than 6,000 people will spend Christmas Eve right on the border and we will think warmly of them and we will all remember that thanks to them, everyone else can spend this Christmas safely in their homes,\" he said.</p><p>Kierwiński spoke about heightened border security, saying that \"almost 30,000 attempts to illegally cross the Polish border\" had been thwarted. \"This shows what a challenge we are facing,\" he said.</p><p>However, activists who continue to provide humanitarian aid on the Polish-Belarusian border and human rights organisations say that although there are now fewer calls from migrants for help, the humanitarian situation remains difficult.</p><p>While reinforcements of the Polish-Belarusian border continue, activists providing humanitarian assistance to migrants report both requests for support and finding bodies in the forest.</p><p>By July, the Polish Border Guard and the Prosecutor's Office had confirmed finding at least 10 corpses of foreigners, although the exact number of victims remains unknown.</p><p>The organisation We Are Monitoring, which documents the crisis in numbers, reported 14 cases in 2025.</p><p>Aid groups continue to receive calls for help, an activist working in Podlasie who spoke on condition of anonymity told Euronews.</p><p>\"(Belarusian President Aliaksandr) Lukashenka withdrew migrants from the zone as they had been making arrangements since the borders opened, but this is not a man you can make arrangements with,\" they said.</p><p>\"The problem is that these people are near Minsk, near Grodno and so on and they are trying to go through the (border crossing) and they can't do that either because the Court doesn't give them an interim (application for temporary protection).\"</p><p>Belarus' military activities are not made public, but there is increasing talk of its involvement in Russia's all-out war in Ukraine.</p><p>Recently, the opposition organisation BELPOL revealed in a YouTube video that a weapons factory is being built near Minsk.</p><p>According to the group, the Uchastok project, which has been under construction since November 2023, envisages the launch of a complete production cycle for artillery and rocket ammunition of Soviet calibres - 122mm and 152mm. The plant is scheduled for completion in December 2026.</p><p>A dedicated production plant has reportedly been established for the project, which is expected to play a major role in the expansion of the Belarusian munitions industry. The factory is located in the Slutsk region, some 60 kilometres from Minsk.</p><p>A BELPOL representative noted that Belarus does not currently manufacture key explosives components, meaning the plant will need to use imported technology and raw materials, with Russia and China as Belarus' main partners in the venture.</p><p>\"Given the scope and volume of production, the end customer will be the Russian Federation,\" opposition figure Uladzimir Zychar said in the report published on YouTube.</p><p>The government has long drawn public attention to the problem of illegal border crossings and migration. At the same time, there are increasing claims that the real threats are more likely to come from Belarus' military actions, according to Poland-based Belarusian news outlet Belsat.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Poland sets up anti-drone system on Belarus border amid security fears","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/23/poland-installs-anti-drone-system-on-belarus-border-amid-rising-security-fears","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T14:53:27.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>A person identified as “A” emailed the disgraced former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell from the British royal family’s Scottish residence in 2001, asking whether she had “found me some new inappropriate friends,” according to newly released documents.</p><p>The email is part of a series of messages exchanged in 2001 and 2002 between Maxwell and someone using the email alias “The Invisible Man,” contained in a trove of files released Tuesday by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  The emails are signed “A.”</p><p>The writer is not explicitly identified as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, but the former prince was introduced to Epstein in 1999 by Maxwell, Epstein’s then-girlfriend and now a convicted sex offender. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p><p>In an email to Maxwell on August 16, 2001, person “A” wrote that “I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.”</p><p>“How’s LA?” “A” wrote in the email. “Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?”</p><p>Maxwell responded: “So sorry to disappoint you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.”</p><p>None of the emails suggest any wrongdoing. CNN has attempted to contact representatives of Mountbatten-Windsor for comment.  Andrew has previously denied all of the allegations against him.</p><p>King Charles strips his brother Andrew of ‘prince’ title and evicts him from royal mansion</p><p>Balmoral, a private estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, is often used by the royal family as a summer residence. CNN has asked Buckingham Palace about the reference to Balmoral.</p><p>In the exchange with Maxwell, “A” added that that their “valet” – who they said had been with them since they were two – had recently died and that they had “left the RN.”</p><p>They wrote: “I am a little off balance as not only has my office been restructured, I have left the RN and now my whole life is in turmoil as I have no one to look after me. He was a real rock and almost a part of the family. If you have any good ideas as to how to get my mind back on track I’d be grateful for advice. See you real soon … I hope if you are coming over. A xxx,” the email closed.</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor left the Royal Navy in July 2001, a month before the email exchange appears to have taken place.</p><p>A separate set of emails appears to show Maxwell helping plan a trip to Peru that involves “girls.”</p><p>In the emails dated between February and March 2002, Maxwell appears to act as a go-between for “A” and a man appearing to coordinate activities. In a February 27 email exchange with Maxwell, the apparent handler suggests he could offer “A” some sightseeing activities including horse riding and a private lunch near the sea, before asking: “About the girls … how old is he? I doubt it that he will find someone here, but we can try.”</p><p>Maxwell forwarded the email to “A,” whose email address appeared as “The Invisible Man.”</p><p>“A” responded that he was “overwhelmed at the kindness and generosity of the offers that are being made for me.”</p><p>He wrote that visiting the archeological site Nazca Lines “sounded interesting” and, “As for girls well I leave that entirely to you and (the handler).”</p><p>Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell launches Hail Mary bid to wipe away her conviction</p><p>In a follow-up email, Maxwell said that “Andrew” would like to do some “sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families).”</p><p>She added: “I know I can rely on you to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun. He does not want to read about any trip in the papers whom or what he saw.”</p><p>“Call me if you have any questions – otherwise you can expect a very English sounding gentleman on the phone to call up and say hi. I told him it would be best if he made his plans directly with you,” Maxwell added.</p><p>On March 3, “A” told Maxwell he would call the Peruvian handler directly.</p><p>The former prince visited Peru in March 2002 on an official visit to mark the 50th anniversary of his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s reign. Images from the trip by Getty Images show the then-prince posing with firefighters in Lima.</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor stepped down from royal duties in 2019 following a disastrous BBC interview over his ties to Epstein. However, the ongoing release of documents by the US government as well as the posthumous memoir of his accuser Virginia Giuffre ignited a firestorm of fresh scrutiny.</p><p>Andrew has denied all of Giuffre’s accusations and says he does not recall ever meeting her, despite a photo of the two taken together with Maxwell.  In 2022, he paid a settlement to Giuffre settling a sex abuse lawsuit.  Giuffre died by suicide in April.</p><p>The renewed spotlight on Andrew’s Epstein links in recent weeks pushed King Charles to strip his brother of his royal titles and order him out of his 30-room residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

However, Mountbatten-Windsor was introduced to Epstein in 1999 by Maxwell, Epstein's then-girlfriend, who was raised in the UK and was a prominent part of its social scene.</p><p>\"How's LA?,\" \"A\" wrote in the email. \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?

{"details":"<p>Warning: This post contains language readers may find disturbing.</p><p>The Justice Department now says a handwritten letter it released Tuesday that was signed by “J. Epstein” and addressed to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar is “fake,” asserting that the handwriting did not appear to match that of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>The department had said earlier Tuesday that it was assessing the validity of the letter – which appeared to make crude references to President Donald Trump – because other details called into question whether it had actually been written and sent by Epstein.</p><p>“This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual,” the Justice Department said in a post on X hours after the letter was released among a tranche of other Epstein-related records.</p><p>The letter does not explicitly name Trump, but instead refers to “our president.” The message appears to have been sent in August 2019, the same month Epstein died by suicide. Trump was president at the time.</p><p>The statement debunking the letter from the Justice Department noted that it was postmarked not in New York, where was Epstein was imprisoned, but in Virginia, and the return address was for a jail different than the one holding Epstein. The envelope was processed three days after Epstein’s suicide.</p><p>Authorities have not accused Trump of any wrongdoing or charged him with any crimes in connection with Epstein.</p><p>“Dear L.N.,” the letters reads, “As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home. Good luck! We shared one thing … our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our President also shares our love of young, nubile girls.” The letter makes another lewd reference to Trump’s treatment of women.</p><p>“Life is unfair,” the letter reads.</p><p>In a separate statement the department released earlier Tuesday, not aimed at any specific record in the most recent release, the Department said that some of the documents released “contain untrue and sensationalist claims” against the president.</p><p>“To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”</p><p>CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the letter.</p><p>While the letter is addressed to an “L.N.,” a photo of the envelope – postmarked on August 13, 2019 and addressed to the former Olympic doctor and sex offender – was released by the DOJ. The envelope says it was sent from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City to Nassar, who was listed as an inmate at a federal prison in Arizona.</p><p>The letter was postmarked three days after Epstein died. Prison staff are authorized to read and inspect outgoing mail, which can cause delays.</p><p>Based on prison documents released from a Freedom of Information Act request, CNN previously reported that while he was jailed, Epstein appeared to send a letter to Nassar — although the contents of the letter were not disclosed. It was discovered by prison officials investigating Epstein’s suicide weeks after his death. It is not known if Nassar and Epstein had a relationship.</p><p>The FBI in 2020 requested from its laboratory a handwriting analysis be done to compare the letter to other writings from Epstein, according to another document posted on Tuesday from the DOJ. While the latest DOJ statement said the FBI had confirmed the letter was “fake,” it did not specifically say that conclusion was based on the 2020 handwriting analysis.</p><p>Nassar, the longtime doctor for the USA gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison. More than 150 women and girls publicly told a court he sexually abused them.</p><p>The envelope, addressed to Larry Nassar at 9300 S. Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756, a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility, was marked as “return to sender,” as the addressee was “no longer at this address.”</p><p>This story has been updated with additional information from the Justice Department about the veracity of the letter.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>At a crunch summit earlier this month, European leaders turned to a tool that would have seemed unthinkable just a few months earlier to break an impasse: issuing joint debt backed by the common budget to keep Ukraine afloat as the war rages on.</p><p>The trick? It bypassed the need for unanimity among member states, gathering those who wanted to work together while keeping Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic out of the deal as a condition for it to go forward. In doing so, the EU not only managed to secure €90 billion for Ukraine for 2026 and 2027 as it had promised, but also showed a new path forward – one where where the unanimity requirement need no longer obstruct coalitions of the willing.</p><p>That is nothing short of extraordinary for a union often constrained by unanimous decision-making. It also builds a theme that is gaining momentum in Brussels: finding alternatives to bypass national vetoes, in particular when exercised by Hungary, which has made its right to veto the centrepiece of its Brussels policy when it comes to Ukraine - from its financing to Kyiv's candidacy to join the EU.</p><p>To issue joint debt at 24, bypassing Budapest, Prague and Bratislava, the EU cited the principle of \"enhanced cooperation\" as foreseen in its treaties. It is just the latest legal tweak that Brussels has turned to in order to break a deadlock.</p><p>Most recently, it also employed Article 122 of the treaties, approved through qualified majority, to keep the Russian frozen assets held in Europe locked indefinitely in the EU. Until then, the assets had been held under a standard sanction regime, which operated on unanimity and therefore depended on securing a yes from Hungary and Slovakia.</p><p>While Article 122 is framed in the treaties as a means by which to address severe economic crises, the plan to use it to unlock funding for Ukraine was clearly a way to bypass recalcitrant member states. It's another example of a strategy the bloc is increasingly using to circumvent vetoes on issues where a near-consensus exists, an approach that is starting to yield results – but not without risks.</p><p>“We see straightforward commitment from the part of EU leadership to try to circumvent potential vetoes coming from Hungary and Slovakia and put important decisions on the footing of qualified majority voting,\" Dániel Hegedűs, a regional director of the German Marshall Fund, told Euronews.</p><p>\"On the other hand, I don't think that this is bulletproof. Neither legally nor politically.”</p><p>According to a list compiled by University College London lecturer Michal Ovádek, since 2011, a total of 46 vetoes have been exercised in the EU by 15 member states across 38 issues. Hungary vetoed EU proposals more than any other member state in recent history, with a total of 19.</p><p>Poland ranks second with seven vetoes, while Slovakia, which has also been frequently in the headlines across Europe for the controversial decisions of Prime Minister Robert Fico, has blocked two decisions, both of them this year.</p><p>Hungary has vetoed a significant number of joint foreign policy statements, but it has also blocked proposals to lend concrete support to Ukraine and start formal EU accession talks with Kyiv.</p><p>The result is that most EU statements supporting Ukraine have been issued in the name of the EU-26, excluding Hungary. This does not change the fact that all member states can veto decisions requiring unanimity for major policy changes.</p><p>Mikuláš Dzurinda, the chair of the Martens Centre think tank and former prime minister of Slovakia, told Euronews that leaders like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron now support changes to the bloc's voting rules.</p><p>But any such move would require a treaty change, which would itself probably be resisted by Hungary – and potentially other member states too. Yet since the systematic use of the veto power has posed a problem for the EU for years, Brussels is now looking for more creative solutions.</p><p>An EU diplomat, who spoke to Euronews on condition of anonymity, said that the European Commission is now deliberately structuring its proposals in order to avoid requiring unanimous consent from member states.</p><p>One attempt to bypass the likely veto from Slovakia and Hungary came in May this year with the presentation of the REpowerEU roadmap, a package designed to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.</p><p>In 2022, the EU imposed sanctions on Russian oil imports following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Hungary and Slovakia received exemptions. This time, the European Commission has decided to phase out Russian fuels altogether despite the opposition of Budapest and Bratislava.</p><p>To do this, the bloc has opted for a veto-proof strategy: the roadmap itself is not legally binding, but the legislation on cutting oil and gas imports will be adopted by a qualified majority at the European Council. Hungary and Slovakia will thus be obliged to drop Russian gas against their will.</p><p>Both countries have already signalled that they will sue the EU and ask for the measure to be annulled.</p><p>\"This is not the first time the EU has reclassified measures that could not gain enough support to be designated as sanctions,\" international law expert Tamás Lattmann said.</p><p>“This has been on the agenda for years: if measures can not be imposed on Russian raw material procurement with sanctions regimes lacking the consensus, they can be reclassified as foreign trade or something else, and it becomes an EU competence,\" Lattmann told the podcast Pirkadat.</p><p>A source at the European Commission told Euronews that Europe could also bypass opposition from member states by adopting a model similar to the Coalition of the Willing, a group of like-minded countries willing to support Ukraine.</p><p>Former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, a highly influential voice in the European debate, has spoken in favour of this model, calling it \"pragmatic federalism\" as the political conditions for a true, federal union do not exist in the EU at the moment.</p><p>The EU has seen many examples of how like-minded countries can advance together through voluntary co-operation, among them the Schengen project and various initiatives in migration and finance. This method is politically the most acceptable option for the bloc's more reluctant countries, and the EU is already operating as a multi-speed organisation.</p><p>The Coalition of the Willing model can also be applied to matters beyond Ukraine, extending to defence and finance. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, also spoke in favour of it in an interview with Euronews, referring to it as a useful format when unanimity cannot be reached despite good faith efforts.</p><p>One area where qualified majority could play a decisive role is EU enlargement.</p><p>Unanimity is always required to approve the start of accession talks and to open each negotiating chapter. At the December 2023 summit, Orbán famously lifted his veto on Ukraine’s accession talks after leaving the leaders' room for a break, while the other member states approved the move. But since then, he has been blocking the opening of negotiating chapters, hindering the accession talks.</p><p>Earlier this year, European Council President António Costa proposed amending the enlargement rules to expedite the process, eliminating the unanimous decision required for each chapter.</p><p>But the changes would have required a treaty change, and the Hungarian premier quickly dismissed the idea at the Copenhagen informal summit in October.</p><p>Right now, the EU is accelerating technical work on negotiating chapters, aiming to have most of the work completed once political approval is granted.</p><p>Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos told Euronews at the flagship EU summit that Ukraine is \"technically ready\" to open up the clusters and that the bloc should get creative in finding a solution for it. But as it stands, unless rules are changed or Orbán can be convinced, Kyiv's bid to move closer to the EU would be stuck in limbo.</p><p>Yet some experts warn that bypassing opposing member states in numerous different areas could backfire on the EU.</p><p>Hungary and Slovakia have already signalled that they will challenge the phase-out of Russian fuels under the REPowerEU framework once the legislation is approved. The Commission faces the same risks over using Article 122 to extend the freeze on the Russian assets; according to Hegedűs, Hungary has a chance of winning those files.</p><p>“Of course, we know that a ruling can be expected in 18 to 24 months, and practically, we need to survive the next couple of months,\" Hegedűs said. \"So, it's a long-term problem, it's practically kicking the can down the road.\"</p><p>Still, bypassing unanimity may present other problems. And it is not clear that all member states would like to see the power of the veto eroded over time, since it is often seen as the last resort to protect national interests.</p><p>All member states have at some point threatened to use their veto at the Council. It also serves as an equaliser between smaller and larger member states, as it ensures that members of any given size hold equal power around the negotiating table.</p><p>\"A veto power is the last line of defence of vital interests,\" Lattmann said. \"Every case of circumvention has led to a set of new problems, often the inoperability or discrediting of the system itself.\"</p><p>With additional reporting from Maria Tadeo</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"The EU wants to end the era of national vetoes – but it's complicated","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/12/23/the-eu-wants-to-end-the-era-of-national-vetoes-but-its-complicated","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T11:15:07.000Z"}

He had enrolled at the private International University, or IU for short.</p><p>Shambarkar has already invested around €20,000 for his studies - a considerable sum for the young man. He had taken out a student loan from an Indian bank.</p><p>\"I don't think the university will pay me back,\" he explained. Others have already had to drop out of university and were left with the costs.</p><p>Instead of writing his master's thesis, he now has to deal with the authorities.</p><p>His visa was due to be extended in the summer. Yet suddenly, a yellow envelope from the Berlin Immigration Office (LEA) arrived in Shambarkar's letterbox: a request to leave the country by 3 November, or face deportation.</p><p>\"I think it's because the university may not have had the right accreditation for its courses,\" said Shambarkar. In a similar case, a student had already lost in court.</p><p>\"They said that the appropriate infrastructure was lacking. There are too few professors at the university.\" Shambarkar has also lodged an appeal. But he has little hope.</p><p>Since March, more and more students have been asked to leave. He knows of around 300 cases, said Shambarkar. This is because the authorities do not recognise IU studies as face-to-face teaching.</p><p>Students could complete it remotely - in Shambarkar's case, from India. They were promised a degree programme in Germany.</p><p>\"Most of the students have since left,\" Shambarkar told Euronews. \"Many have changed universities, at least those from wealthy families. Others have gone back home. They were helpless.\"</p><p>With more than 130,000 students, IU is one of the largest universities in Germany. Around 4,500 of them are Indian. They make up a good fifth of international students.</p><p>Many of them, like Shambarkar, found the university through the Indian placement agency UpGrad.</p><p>The company supports people who dream of studying abroad. The first part of the degree programme is completed online from India; in Shambarkar's case, it was the first semester. The students then move to Germany to complete their degree there.</p><p>Tanishq was also placed at the university via UpGrad. The 20-year-old from Delhi has just completed the first year of his bachelor's degree in business administration.</p><p>He was supposed to have continued his studies in Berlin in September. Instead, he is stuck in India. His visa has not yet been granted.</p><p>\"I feel cheated,\" he tells Euronews via video interview.</p><p>One of his friends is already studying in Germany. \"He says I'm lucky I didn't get my visa. Otherwise I would have been deported too,\" says Tanishq.</p><p>In India, he at least has the support of his family. \"In Germany, students have nothing,\" says the Indian national.</p><p>Tanishq would prefer to simply forget about the experience. He has already invested a lot of time - \"a year wasted,\" as Tanishq puts it.</p><p>Nevertheless, he does not want to give up his dream of studying in Germany and plans to try again with another university. \"In the meantime, I'm learning German. I already have B1 level.\"</p><p>Simply ticking it off and forgetting everything - that's hardly an option for Shambarkar. \"I've invested a lot of time and money,\" he explains.</p><p>Another university is also not an option, as Shambarkar fears that they would not recognise his achievements.</p><p>He still hopes to graduate from IU after all, and needs about six months to do so. \"I only have a few modules left and the Master's thesis,\" said Shambarkar.</p><p>In response to an enquiry from Euronews, IU said the university \"regrets\" that students must leave.</p><p>At the beginning of 2025, the LEA changed its approach to hybrid degree programmes \"without informing IU International University.\"</p><p>New study regulations will take effect in 2026. \"This is to ensure that the face-to-face study programmes meet all regulatory requirements for visa issuance.\"</p><p>In particular, the LEA's change of visa policy for students \"who have entered the country under different conditions\" is incomprehensible, the university said.</p><p>In some instances, students could complete their studies free of charge in their home countries.</p><p>Looking back, the degree programme was \"disappointing,\" said Shambarkar. \"I never felt like I was at a university. There were a few classrooms, a few courses. I chose the right degree programme for me, but not the right university.\"</p><p>The Berlin campus on Frankfurter Allee is more office-like than a university. Here in the Plaza, which also houses a shopping centre, IU has rented several floors.</p><p>The university uses around 11,700 square metres of converted hotel space here, between an optician and a supermarket.</p><p>Contacting the university is complicated, explains Shambarkar. He received little support from the IU. \"They are now paying lawyers so that students don't have to use their own money to lodge an appeal,\" he claimed.</p><p>Shambarkar said he was suffering under the pressure.</p><p>\"It's hard to face the situation - mentally and physically,\" he stated. \"I'm treated like a criminal.\"</p><p>Another student's example, who wished to remain anonymous, shows just how burdensome this is. \"I feel like a failure. The situation has massively damaged my psyche. Sometimes I feel like my life is about to end,\" he told Euronews.</p><p>Although he came to Germany legally on a student visa and is still studying, he is also on the brink of deportation.</p><p>\"I no longer have an appetite and suffer from nightmares and insomnia. My life feels like hell.\" The authorities have given him one month to leave the country.</p><p>In the meantime, the IU no longer wants to accept international students at the Berlin campus, Euronews has learnt from insiders.</p><p>A message obtained by Euronews states, \"Due to the ongoing legal and administrative uncertainties with the LEA, IU will suspend all new student admissions to the Berlin campus until further notice.\"</p><p>A court has recognised that the IU has the necessary accreditation for degree programmes as well as sufficient staff and infrastructure.</p><p>At the same time, the court has tightened the requirements, \"including stricter attendance controls with sanctions and examinations that take place exclusively on campus.\"</p><p>The judges had made it clear that the judgment was highly controversial. It would contradict university law.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Berlin State Office for Immigration told Euronews that residence permit extensions are regularly reviewed.</p><p>The focus is on whether conditions such as \"sufficient livelihood, proper full-time studies, passport possession, no interest in deportation, for example due to the commission of criminal offences\" are met.</p><p>Students would temporarily receive so-called \"fictitious certificates,\" meaning that the residence permit is \"granted or denied\". This also applies to IU students.</p><p>The university is now planning to inaugurate a campus in Cologne. It is due to open in October 2026.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Indian students at Berlin university face deportation, not graduation","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/23/broken-promises-indian-students-at-a-berlin-university-face-deportation-instead-of-graduat","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T05:59:02.000Z"}
{"details":"<p>An airplane has, for the first time, automatically landed itself after an in-flight emergency, according to the system’s manufacturer.</p><p>Two people emerged unscathed from the Beechcraft Super King Air 200 after it stopped on the runway at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport near Denver, according to video posted by emergency responders.</p><p>The twin-engine turboprop landed under the control of Garmin’s Autoland system, which the company says is now installed on about 1,700 airplanes. “This was the first use of Autoland from start-to-finish in an actual emergency,” Garmin said in a statement.</p><p>The operator of the plane, charter company Buffalo River Aviation, says the Autoland system automatically engaged during a flight from Aspen with no passengers on board.</p><p>“The aircraft experienced a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization” and the pilots put on their oxygen masks, said charter company CEO Chris Townsley in a statement. Autoland “automatically engaged exactly as designed when the cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels” and the pilots “made the decision to leave the system engaged,” Townsley said.</p><p>In a demonstration of the system in a Cirrus Aircraft SR22 in April, CNN was able to test Autoland under controlled circumstances.

{"details":"<p>In May 1989, Dame Anna Wintour did something that would become a hallmark of her time as editor-in-chief of US Vogue - she put a pop star on the cover.</p><p>Just a year into her tenure as the top of the magazine's masthead, Dame Anna had already made a name for herself as an editor who instinctively understood the zeitgeist. She was the first to put a model in jeans on Vogue's front, and now, Madonna.</p><p>\"If it was edgy to do jeans for November 1988, I think it was even edgier for her to do Madonna,\"  says Amy Odell, author of Anna: The Biography.</p><p>For Marian Kwei, a stylist and Vogue contributor, this move speaks to Dame Anna's ability to make Vogue \"relevant to our times, make it contemporary, make it accessible\".</p><p>\"Before, it was women who could buy couture who were interested in what Vogue had to say,\" she says. \"But Dame Anna realised the need to reach out to the kids listening to Madonna.\"</p><p>Now almost 40 years later, Dame Anna is preparing to hang up her Manolo Blahnik's, sort of –  while she will no longer be editor-in-chief, she will remain on as global editorial director. Down the hall will sit her heir, the 39-year-old Chloe Malle, who is stepping in as head of editorial content.</p><p>While some have attributed her continued presence as a sign of unwillingness to cede total control, one could also see it as a recognition of her unmatched place in the fashion industry, and the fear that should she go entirely, this print magazine – already a relic to some – will lose its remaining clout.</p><p>Once, fashion magazines like Vogue ruled the industry. They didn't have to fight for attention so much as just decree from on high what was and wasn't \"chic\".</p><p>Whether you still see – or ever saw – Vogue as an arbiter of good taste, or reflection of our times, depends on who you talk to.</p><p>\"I think it's more relevant than people want to admit honestly,\" Odell says.</p><p>For Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, the founder and editor-in-chief of academic fashion publication Vestoj, less so. When she was a teenager growing up in Sweden, \"Vogue represented the world out there, something glamorous and different and the wide horizons that I was striving for.\"</p><p>But she stopped reading it 25 years ago.</p><p>Today, print magazines are fighting for survival in an increasingly crowded, fast-paced landscape – a monthly publication loses a lot of relevance in a by-the-minute digital world.</p><p>\"There's no one magazine that is relevant in the way Vogue might have been relevant in the 80s,\" says Cronberg.</p><p>\"There are so many other vehicles for culture today,\" she adds, like TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>All this will be factoring into Malle's thinking as she takes on the job of head of editorial content. She reportedly plans to put out issues less frequently, centred around themes or cultural events rather than months. She says she wants to lean into the idea of Vogue in print as something to collect and cherish.</p><p>One of the ways that Dame Anna has kept Vogue a part of the conversation is by expanding the people she invited onto the cover.</p><p>Since Maddona's debut, Dame Anna has placed royalty, politicians, pop stars, writers and gymnasts on the cover.</p><p>\"She definitely bridged fashion and entertainment as editor-in-chief of Vogue,\" says Odell.</p><p>It wasn't always well received. When Dame Anna put Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the cover in 2014, \"it sparked so much debate\", says Kwei.</p><p>\"Nobody really wanted to dress [her] because she was a reality star.\"</p><p>Looking at the almost mythological position the Kardashians have gone on to occupy, the cover spoke to Dame Anna's uncanny ability to anticipate culture – as well, arguably, as drive it.</p><p>But whether Dame Anna remains the right person to be at the helm, and whether the magazine can withstand increasing financial pressures, remains to be seen.</p><p>It is a far more corporate world than it once was.</p><p>Her decision to spotlight Lauren Sanchez, the now-wife of Jeff Bezos, also sparked accusations that the magazine was selling out. It was read by some as more about celebrating wealth and luxury than style. Interestingly, it was Malle who apparently organised the story on the power couple's wedding and was dispatched to write it.</p><p>Vanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic of The New York Times pointed out in a recent article that \"while elite weddings are a hallmark of Vogue, they almost never made its cover, and Ms Sánchez Bezos seemingly had neither the celebrity nor modelling credentials that usually merited cover treatment.\" The couple's presence at Donald Trump's inauguration also drew criticism from some - and contributed to the cover's backlash, especially on social media.</p><p>Dame Anna, who has supported Democratic candidates in the past, has over the years featured Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Jill Biden and, most recently, Kamala Harris. It feels pertinent that whether or not she will invite Melania Trump to be on the cover has been the subject of much discussion – and continues to be, even as Malle steps into the role.</p><p>But Vogue can arguably withstand more of this kind of criticism than most because of its fabled history. As Lauren Sherman, the fashion journalist who broke the news of Malle's appointment, tells the BBC: \"The Vogue brand stands apart, and is one of the most important fashion brands in the world.\"</p><p>A large part of Vogue's standing in the world is wrapped up in Dame Anna's own - the enigmatic editor-in-chief of fashion, with her instantly recognisable bob and her unknowability.</p><p>She has maintained a certain relevancy for the title almost by being the relevancy.</p><p>\"Anna has been able to stay relevant despite all the various eras we've lived through simply by being as synonymous with culture, fashion and beauty as possible,\" says Kwei.</p><p>This, despite being criticised for being late to make Vogue more diverse compared to other sections of the industry.</p><p>\"She's a mainstream celebrity figure,\" says Odell. \"What other editor has had a book and an iconic movie made about them? You know, she's been played by Meryl Streep!\"</p><p>For Cronberg, she is \"a brand in and of herself at this point\".</p><p>So what next?</p><p>\"I think we're about to see how much of the relevance of Vogue comes from Dame Anna,\" says Odell.</p><p>While Malle may have inherited the magazine's prestige, \"it'll be up to Chloe and her team to see if they can use it wisely to influence the way the culture moves,\" says Sherman.</p><p>Ellie Violet Bramley is a freelance writer and former Guardian fashion and lifestyle editor.</p><p>Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.</p><p>The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.</p><p>Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.</p><p>The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\"</p><p>\"Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein's victims,\" the DOJ statement on X said.</p><p></p><p>The prosecutor's email was sent on 7 January 2020 and is part of an email chain which includes the subject heading: \"RE: Epstein flight records.\"</p><p>The sender and recipient are redacted, but the bottom of the email says assistant US attorney, Southern District of New York - with the name redacted.</p><p>The email states that Trump \"is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which [Epstein's associate Ghislaine] Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.\"</p><p>\"On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old...\" - the rest of the sentence has been redacted.</p><p>It continues: \"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p>The email says Trump flew on Epstein's jet \"including during the period we would expect to charge in a Maxwell case\".</p><p>In 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for crimes including conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and sex trafficking of a minor. The DOJ at the time said she committed the crimes from at least 1994 to up to, and including in or about, 2004.</p><p>Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>The prosecutor's email does not provide more details about the flights.</p><p>A handwritten flight log released by the DOJ in February appears to have many entries which are difficult to read.</p><p>However, one lists Donald Trump, as well as his son Eric, for a flight on 13 August 1995 from PBI (Palm Beach International Airport in Florida) to TEB (Teterboro Airport in New Jersey). It also lists JE and GM - widely believed to be acronyms for Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Tuesday's release of files related to Epstein is the largest so far - but many more documents held by the DOJ are yet to be made public. Several thousand files have been published across eight batches since Friday.</p><p>The DOJ missed last Friday's deadline set by Congress to publish all its files related to Epstein - including photos, videos and investigative materials.</p><p>The department has faced criticism from survivors and lawmakers from across the aisle for its failure to meet that deadline.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on the day of the deadline that not all the files would be made public immediately, and that more would be published over the coming weeks.</p><p>\"There's a lot of eyes looking at these, so we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials that we're producing, we're protecting every single victim,\" he said on Friday.</p><p>Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.</p><p>Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.</p><p>Why the Catholic Church and Donald Trump’s government are at odds over immigration policy.</p><p>\"Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" wrote Ben Sasse.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Ben Sasse, who represented Nebraska in the US Senate from 2015 to 2023, has announced he has pancreatic cancer, saying in a lengthy social media post that his diagnosis is a \"death sentence\".</p><p>Sasse was one of seven Republicans who voted to impeach President Donald Trump shortly after the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot. Ultimately, the Senate did not approve removing Trump from office.</p><p>\"Friends - This is a tough note to write, but since a bunch of you have started to suspect something, I'll cut to the chase: Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" Sasse posted on X on Tuesday.</p><p>He and his wife have three children.</p><p>\"Advanced pancreatic is nasty stuff; it's a death sentence.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>After hosts Morocco opened the tournament with a 2-0 win over Comoros, attention in Group A turned to Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, where Mali met Zambia in the day’s first fixture.</p><p>Mali were awarded a first-half penalty but failed to convert, before finally breaking the deadlock just after the hour mark through Lassine Sinayoko. Zambia refused to fold, and Patson Daka struck deep into stoppage time with a powerful header to seal a 1-1 draw.</p><p>“I think it was a very good game because football is, above all, a pleasure, so both teams played very well,” said one fan after the final whistle.</p><p>“The atmosphere was incredible. It was a big game for Mali, we supported them, and it was very cool to be here,” added another supporter.</p><p>“The game was quite tough for us in the first minutes, but we liked the spirit, how they fought after conceding. They didn't relent, they worked very hard, and you know how sweet that last‑minute goal is,” a third fan said.</p><p>“I was supporting Mali, actually, but the game was interesting right to the end. It was exciting, and even though my team was leading, they were pegged back to a draw. But everything is OK,” another fan reflected.</p><p>“It finished as a draw and we are so excited. It was a great match. Both teams were strong today and it was good to see. We’ll be following Zambia all the way here in Morocco,” said a Zambian supporter.</p><p>The result leaves both Mali and Zambia two points behind Morocco in Group A. Next up, Zambia face Comoros in Casablanca, while Mali take on the hosts in Rabat in what already looks like a pivotal clash.</p><p>Away from the stadium, Casablanca’s official AFCON 2025 fan park offered activities and a chance to soak up the tournament atmosphere. While Group A unfolded in the economic capital, Group B kicked off in Marrakech, where South Africa took on Angola.</p><p>South Africa made a winning start as Oswin Appollis put Bafana Bafana ahead, only for Angola to level before half-time. In the second half, Lyle Foster restored South Africa’s lead to clinch a 2-1 victory.</p><p>Egypt matched that 2-1 scoreline against Zimbabwe, coming from behind to take all three points. Prince Dube opened the scoring for Zimbabwe, but Omar Marmoush equalised before Mohamed Salah struck in stoppage time to complete the turnaround.</p><p>Salah captained the team in his first start for nearly a month and fired inside the bottom corner in stoppage time to spare Egypt embarrassment against a team ranked 129th in the world.</p><p>Egypt, the record seven-time champion, was thwarted for long periods in the coastal city of Agadir by Zimbabwe’s stubborn defending and an outstanding performance from goalkeeper Washington Arubi.</p><p>Those results set up a top-of-the-table showdown in Agadir on Friday, with Egypt’s Pharaohs facing South Africa’s Bafana Bafana. The sides have met three times previously at AFCON, with Egypt winning twice.</p><p>Video editor • Christophe Pitiot</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"AFCON 2025: Bafana Bafana win, Salah rescues Egypt as contest heats up","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/12/23/afcon-2025-bafana-bafana-win-salah-rescues-egypt-as-afcon-2025-heats-up","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-12-23T08:56:10.000Z"}
{"details":"<p>Driving past the mountains, creeks, and rivers near her home in southwestern Germany, Kate Raidt says the scenery still catches her attention. She jokes that she’s “probably the only soccer mom from America who loves away games.”</p><p>Raidt looks forward to the drive from Ulm, the city where she lives, to Munich for her teenage son’s soccer commitments. “It’s really hard to be in a bad mood when you’re driving through all of this beauty,” she says.</p><p>“When you can look out and see the Swiss Alps or hear water running because of a creek or a river nearby, that is something that makes me so happy,” Raidt, originally from Atlanta, tells CNN Travel.</p><p>A year and a half after relocating from the US to Germany with her son Bodie, Raidt says the move has gone “way better than anybody could have imagined,” and that both are thriving.</p><p>Living close to natural sights like the Danube River and the Bavarian Alps has reshaped her daily routine. She’s constantly on the move — hiking, cycling along the Danube, visiting thermal spas or going “castle hunting” with her son.</p><p>“That’s probably the biggest landslide win for being over here,” she says, praising a lifestyle she feels is focused less on quantity and more on quality.</p><p>”My physical health. My mental health… Having such easy, quick physical activity at my fingertips completely saved me.”</p><p>The decision to relocate began with her son’s opportunities. Bodie, a skilled soccer player, had been incited to try out for several German clubs and received offers.</p><p>Although Raidt had visited Germany often — her daughter was born there during her marriage to a German native — she hadn’t planned to move back permanently. But her son’s ambitions changed her thinking.</p><p>She told him they would wait until his older sister Conley left for college. “I didn’t want him living alone with a host family, so I decided to go with him,” she says.</p><p>‘I cried copious tears’: She struggled and thought she’d never fit in after moving from Chicago to Poland</p><p>A few weeks after her daughter graduated in 2024, Raidt and Bodie left the US for Germany.</p><p>They started out in an Airbnb in Ulm, a historic city based between Munich and Stuttgart, where Bodie joined a local team. “I literally had two suitcases,” Raidt says. “We had no friends. No family. No nothing… So, it was just ready, set, go. Let’s make this happen.”</p><p>Raidt says she soon realized she had a lot to learn. One of her first challenges was education. Bodie holds dual nationality but wasn’t able to enroll in a German high school as “he didn’t have enough foreign language experience.”</p><p>He eventually joined an international school, which Raidt says was a turning point. She bonded quickly with other expat parents.</p><p>“We’ve all left our home countries and come here,” she says. Their emotional support, Raidt adds, has helped her through difficult times.</p><p>As Raidt settled in, she gained a deeper appreciation for life in Germany outside her remote work for a US-based company.</p><p>She loves the fact that “people constantly get together for coffee,” in contrast to the US, where “everyone zips through the Starbucks drive-thru.”</p><p>“America only has one city out of the whole entire place that really has a defined culture, and that’s New Orleans,” she says. “So, Germany kind of reminds me of that.”</p><p>But there are downsides, she admits. She dislikes the amount of cigarette smoking and finds some aspects of daily life too rigid, too “black and white.”</p><p>Bureaucracy has also been tricky to navigate due to the “constant stress of going to government offices and standing in line.”</p><p>“Getting a driver’s license in Germany is like passing the bar exam or getting a medical license,” she says.</p><p>Securing a family reunification visa, which allows family members to join a relative who is a legal resident in Germany, was “long and challenging” and required her to sign up for German health insurance, which costs her around $1,300 a month.</p><p>‘The US is the best place to exist’: She returned to Germany after living in California, and now she’s full of regret</p><p>She says some people in Germany “simply hate immigrants,” and treat her differently because of her US accent.</p><p>Still, she says the overall experience with Germans has been positive. She’s made “wonderful friends,” especially among parents on her son’s soccer team.</p><p>“None of them really speak any English,” says Raidt. “But it’s forced me to improve my German and kind of meet in the middle.”</p><p>Raidt had conversational German from her earlier visits, but she needed to improve her skills to cope with basic events like handling rental contracts, doctors’ appointments and official documents. She now takes a four-hour daily language course as she aims to pass the fluency exam she needs for citizenship.</p><p>“There’s days where I’m like, ‘This is going to literally send me to my grave,’” she says. “But at the same time, it gets me out of bed.”</p><p>For anyone considering a move abroad, Raidt advises choosing a place where where they speak the language already.</p><p>“I learned very quickly that if you’re going to live somewhere your language better be better than conversational level,” she says. “Or it’s very hard.”</p><p>Raidt finds Germany expensive, especially utilities and notes that “everything’s a little bit smaller” now including her car and her home. But that shift, she says, has clarified what she needs</p><p>She felt the difference sharply when she returned to the US for an extended stay in the spring. Sliding back into old habits — driving everywhere, sitting at a desk all day — left her “overwhelmed with emotions and stress.”</p><p>“Even though I still had the same stress in my life, it didn’t nearly affect me as much once I got back here,” she says. “I think it’s because I was constantly physically moving and getting so much more exercise. It just kept me so sane.”</p><p>Raidt has recently revived a former passion. She’s recording an album two decades after turning her back on music.</p><p>“So at age 54 and no music in my life for 20 years, I’m bringing it back with a vengeance!” she says.</p><p>Raidt doesn’t miss much about Atlanta, she says, but does yearn for her “mom friends” and had cravings for US fast food like Chick-fil-A.</p><p>She returns to the US as often as she can to visit Conley, who plays college tennis in Nebraska. Meanwhile, Bodie seems to be thriving — a huge relief for Raidt.</p><p>“Even if I loved it here, if he was miserable, we’d have to get out of here,” she says. “Because this is all for him. So the biggest win-win is that he’s been doing really well… And it was a big kind of lifestyle upgrade for me.”</p><p>‘The best decision I ever made’: Why this New Yorker ditched the United States for ‘super safe’ Germany</p><p>The pair currently live in a three-bedroom townhouse on the “mountain side” of Ulm, plan to stay in Germany for “at least two more years,” until Bodie graduates from high school.</p><p>Raidt says that the sale of her home in Atlanta felt like the closing of the final chapter of her life in the US, and she doesn’t “have an interest in coming back.”</p><p>She’s unlikely to stay in Ulm once her son leaves, but she’s open to staying in Europe.</p><p>“Maybe I go to Austria,” she says. “Maybe I go to Switzerland. Maybe I go to Spain… I don’t know. But I would love to keep exploring Europe. I would really love to stay over here.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

All four injured were Elkem Silicones employees. Two are in critical condition, whilst a third suffered serious injuries, authorities said.</p><p>Jean-Pierre Laurent, the site director, said the explosion was likely caused by hydrogen emanation in an experimental workshop where five people were working at the time.</p><p>Authorities activated the Orsec emergency response plan and sent FR-Alert messages to residents in Saint-Fons, Feyzin, Pierre-Bénite and Vénissieux — affecting over 100,000 people — ordering them to shelter indoors as a precaution. A 1-kilometre security perimeter was established around the facility.</p><p>The A7 motorway linking Lyon and Marseille was closed in both directions immediately after the explosion. Rail traffic on the Lyon-Valence-Marseille and Lyon-Saint-Etienne lines was also suspended, along with river navigation.</p><p>French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot announced in the early evening that the A7 had reopened to traffic. Rail and river traffic around the sensitive chemical site also resumed.</p><p>Regional prefect Fabienne Buccio lifted the confinement order around 6 pm after the fire was brought under control. Authorities confirmed there was no risk of toxicity to the population at any time, with regular air quality monitoring conducted by regional environmental services.</p><p>The Elkem Silicones plant in Saint-Fons, which employs approximately 400 people, has experienced previous incidents.</p><p>In June 2016, a worker was killed when silicone drums caught fire in a 2,500-square-metre warehouse, with 600 square metres of the building destroyed.</p><p>In 2022, the Rhône prefecture issued a formal notice to the facility for non-compliant storage of hazardous materials and deficient fire suppression systems.

{"details":"<p>The US State Department on Tuesday imposed visa sanctions on a former top European Union official and employees of organizations that combat disinformation for alleged censorship – sharply ratcheting up the Trump administration’s fight against European regulations that have impacted digital platforms, far-right politicians and Trump allies, including Elon Musk.</p><p>In a statement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the five sanctioned people of leading “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”</p><p>Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly condemned European nations for alleged censorship, and the latest State Department human rights report alleged “significant human rights issues” in allies like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany over “serious restrictions on freedom of expression.”</p><p>The new sanctions were quickly met by outcry from European officials, including the French foreign minister.</p><p>Among those sanctioned Tuesday are Thierry Breton, a former European commissioner involved in the Digital Services Act (DSA), a sweeping EU law that requires Big Tech platforms to take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.</p><p>In a social media post on Tuesday, Breton questioned: “Is McCarthy’s witch hunt back?”, referencing the late senator’s Cold-War era inquisition of alleged communists who he claimed had infiltrated American government institutions.</p><p>“To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he said on X.</p><p>The State Department also targeted the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Imran Ahmed. The organization says it “works to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation through innovative research, public campaigns and policy advocacy.”</p><p>CNN reached out to the Center for Countering Digital Hate but did not immediately receive a reply.</p><p>Clare Melford, the CEO of the Global Disinformation Index, was also sanctioned. The organization describes itself as working to strengthen “the systems that make the internet safer by working with governments, industry, and civil society.”</p><p>In a statement to CNN a spokesperson for GDI said that the sanctions amounted to an “authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”</p><p>“The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with,” the spokesperson said. “Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.”</p><p>Leaders of the German organization HateAid, Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, were also sanctioned. The organization aims to combat “hate, violence and systematic disinformation” on the internet.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, the two said they were “not surprised” by the sanctions.</p><p>“It is an act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary. This marks a new escalation: The US government is clearly questioning European sovereignty,” they said.</p><p>“We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they continued. “Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever. We stand in solidarity with all those affected, and with all those who now fear similar measures.”</p><p>Rubio’s statement said that for the five sanctioned people, he had “determined that their entry, presence, or activities in the United States have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”</p><p>“These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies,” he said.</p><p>The top US diplomat said that “based on these determinations,” the State Department “has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.” Further, the Department of Homeland Security “can initiate removal proceedings against certain individuals … which renders such individuals deportable,” he said.</p><p>Breton has repeatedly clashed with Musk over the Digital Services Act. In August 2024, Breton told Musk in a letter –  ahead of an interview with Donald Trump – that he must comply with the regulation, according to Reuters.</p><p>US Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers specifically referenced that letter in a post on X Tuesday, accusing Breton of having “ominously reminded Musk of X’s legal obligations and ongoing ‘formal proceedings’ for alleged noncompliance with ‘illegal content’ and ‘disinformation’ requirements under the DSA.”</p><p>Rogers said Ahmed was a “key collaborator with the Biden Administration’s effort to weaponize the government against U.S. citizens.” She indicated he had been sanctioned, in part, for the organization’s 2022 “Disinformation Dozen” report, which took aim at 12 anti-vaxxers, including now-HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., responsible for the majority of anti‑vaccine content circulating on social media platforms.</p><p>Rogers, in a social media post, accused Melford’s organization of using US “taxpayer money to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press.”</p><p>“The State Department stands ready and willing to expand today’s list if other foreign actors do not reverse course,” Rubio said.</p><p>In February Vice President JD Vance used one of his first major speeches after taking office to criticize what he described as censorship efforts in Europe in a speech delivered at the Munich Security Conference.</p><p>He claimed that leaders had “threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation,” citing the example of the Covid-19 lab leak theory.</p><p>“It looks more and more like old entrenched interest, hiding behind ugly, Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion,” he added.</p><p>This story has been updated with additional reaction.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

A Polish court placed him in custody for 40 days until 13 January while the extradition process proceeds.</p><p>Butyagin had been in Poland to deliver lectures, having previously given talks in Prague and Amsterdam.</p><p>Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office in November 2024 charged an unnamed Russian citizen, later identified by Ukrainian media as Butyagin, with illegal excavations in occupied Crimea.</p><p>Ukrainian authorities accuse Butyagin of conducting archaeological work at the ancient city of Myrmekion in the Kerch district of Crimea from 2014 to 2019 without permits from Ukrainian authorities, resulting in the partial destruction of the archaeological site.</p><p>The Ukrainian security service SBU said in a statement that Butyagin's excavations damaged Ukrainian cultural heritage, with the archaeological team removing \"the so-called cultural layer of the Ukrainian peninsula to a depth of almost two metres\".</p><p>Ukrainian authorities estimate the damage at more than 200 million hryvnia (approximately €4.75 million).</p><p>The charges cover illegal search operations at archaeological heritage sites and destruction or damage to cultural heritage sites committed while searching for movable objects.</p><p>If extradited to Ukraine and convicted, he faces between one and 10 years in prison.

{"details":"<p>South Africans have long suspected corruption and political interference were at work in the police force but in the past few months allegations appearing to confirm this have been aired in two public inquiries.</p><p>President Cyril Ramaphosa is currently digesting the contents of an interim report from a commission he established to investigate illegality within the police.</p><p>It was set up after senior police officer Lt-Gen Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged in July that organised crime groups had infiltrated the government.</p><p>His dramatic intervention led to Police Minister Senzo Mchunu being put on special leave.</p><p>Lt-Gen Mkhwanazi, who heads up the police in KwaZulu-Natal province, claimed that Mchunu had ties to crime kingpins and this was why he shut down an elite unit investigating political murders.</p><p>Mchunu, a senior member of Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC) and a close ally of the president, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>But to investigate the allegations, Ramaphosa asked retired Constitutional Court judge Mbuyiseli Madlanga to head up a public inquiry. Parliament in Cape Town set up its own panel to investigate the matter.</p><p>\"As I see it now, this is terrorism,\" Gen Mkhwanazi said appearing as the Madlanga Commission's first witness in September.</p><p>These are \"people who want to take over government, not through the ballot paper but through these criminal activities\".</p><p>In the three months of testimony from the parallel inquiries, South Africans have heard about an alleged drug cartel with political connections and a businessman, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, with alleged ties to leading government figures. A witness at the Madlanga Commission was also murdered after giving evidence.</p><p>Here's what we've learned so far:</p><p>Among the most explosive evidence was the testimony given by police crime intelligence boss Lt-Gen Dumisani Khumalo.</p><p>Appearing before the Madlanga Commission within the first month of hearings, Lt-Gen Khumalo alleged there was a drug trafficking cartel, headed by individuals who he called the Big Five, operating in several provinces, which had \"penetrated the political sphere\".</p><p>He named two figures from the five alleged leaders of this criminal gang, one of them being controversial businessman Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p>Mr Matlala is currently facing 25 criminal charges, among them attempted murder.</p><p>These stem from three separate incidents that occurred between 2022 and 2024. He has denied all the charges against him.</p><p>The crime intelligence boss claimed the Big Five led a network with widespread influence across the country.</p><p>He alleged that it was a cartel, that was operating both locally and abroad, and dealt mainly with narcotics but also carried out contract killings \"associated with the drug trafficking processes\", cross-border hijackings and kidnappings.</p><p>This cartel had tentacles within the country's criminal justice system, and this allowed them to \"manipulate investigations, suppress evidence [and] obstruct legal proceedings that threaten their activities\", Lt-Gen Khumalo added.</p><p>It was this grouping that was allegedly behind the disbandment of the political killings task team (PKTT), which was working mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p><p>This is because the cartel \"mistakenly thought the PKTT was investigating\" them, Lt-Gen Khumalo told the commission.</p><p>\"The Big Five has already penetrated the political sphere and there are documented cases of high-profile connections in the political arena,\" the policeman alleged.</p><p>Another witness at the Madlanga Commission had been part of the PKTT. Anonymised – and known only as \"witness C\" - he also mentioned what he called the Big Five cartel, alleging it had \"full control and oversight\" in every government department.</p><p>Central to the allegations against the suspended police minister is his alleged close relationship with \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p>At the Madlanga Commission, Mkhwanazi repeated claims he had made at a press conference in July that Mchunu was indirectly receiving financial support from the businessman to fund his \"political endeavours\".</p><p>He shared copies of text messages and a payment allegedly made by Matlala to prove this at the time. These payments were seemingly facilitated by a third party.</p><p>During his appearance at the Madlanga Commission Mchunu refuted the allegations saying that he had \"never been accused of corruption, not once\".</p><p>\"This is the first time I get accused of such.\"</p><p>Mr Matlala had a lucrative contract with the police before it was abruptly cancelled when he was charged for attempted murder in May.</p><p>In 2001, he was convicted and served time for the possession of stolen goods.</p><p>Over the years, he would be arrested for a string of alleged crimes, including house robberies, a cash-in-transit heist and assault, but in all cases he denied involvement and was either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn against him.</p><p>Appearing at the parliamentary inquiry, Mr Matlala said he had turned his life around in 2017, when he \"formally registered my first business which was a security business\".</p><p>As he is now in custody over the attempted murder charge, he gave evidence with restraints around his ankles. Over the course of his two-day testimony in front of MPs Mr Matlala laid bare his description of relationships with former and current ministers as well as top police officials.</p><p>Apart from being accused of having close ties to Mchunu, Mr Matlala has been linked to others in the police force.</p><p>He denied knowing the senior police officers and politicians personally but admitted making payments for ANC-related activities.</p><p>\"From what I understand, the minister [Mchunu] sent [a third party] to go ask for donations there and there, and I was one of them,\" Mr Matlala told MPs.</p><p>He also told the parliamentary panel that after the authorities had returned firearms seized from him, former Police Minister Bheki Cele had demanded \"a facilitation fee\" of 1m rand ($60,000; £45,000) to which he only paid half the amount. Mr Matlala alleged that Cele also allegedly asked for this money to stop harassment from the police.</p><p>Cele, who testified before Mr Matlala's appearance at the parliamentary committee, admitted to MPs that he had known Mr Matlala for a couple of months and had stayed at his penthouse on two occasions as these were \"freebies\".</p><p>He, however, denied receiving money from Mr Matlala.</p><p>Mr Matlala has not yet appeared at the Madlanga Commission but is expected to have a chance to speak there at some point next year.</p><p>Various witnesses, however, painted a different picture of Mr Matlala's relationship with the police.</p><p>Witness C told the Madlanga Commission that Mr Matlala had \"close relationships with senior [police] officials\" and had detailed the extent of this after police arrested him back in May.</p><p>The witness alleged that Mr Matlala contributed money towards the now-suspended police minister's presidential ambitions within the ANC even though he did not believe he would win.</p><p>A witness at the Madlanga Commission was murdered in early December, just three weeks after he gave testimony.</p><p>It is not clear if the two events were connected.</p><p>Marius van der Merwe, who was identified only as \"Witness D\" during his appearance, was killed in full view of his family.</p><p>He had just returned home in the evening and was gunned down as he waited for the front gate to open. No arrests have been made but three people of interest have been identified by police. The motive for the shooting is unclear.</p><p>The identity of Mr Van der Merwe, a former police officer who ran a private security company, was confirmed by authorities after his murder.</p><p>In his appearance in front of Judge Madlanga he had implicated officials, including Brig Julius Mkhwanazi (no relation to Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi) who was acting police chief for an area including parts of Johannesburg.</p><p>There he had claimed Brig Mkhwanazi ordered him to get rid of the body of a man accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officials.</p><p>Commenting on this, Mr Van der Merwe told the commission: \"I really did not have a chance to agree. I felt like I was being forced.\"</p><p>In his testimony, Brig Mkhwanazi denied having any involvement in the case including the alleged disposal of the body. Instead, he told the commission he had been called to the scene of a crime within the municipality and had stayed there for \"two to three minutes\".</p><p>Mr Van der Merwe's death after giving evidence sparked outrage across South Africa.</p><p>The targeting of whistleblowers has become common in the country, with rights groups like Human Rights Watch noting that \"many face retaliation, loss of livelihood and even loss of life\".</p><p>The authorities revealed that Mr Van der Merwe had refused witness protection following his testimony at the commission.</p><p>Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said that Judge Madlanga's interim report would not be made public as it was not \"helpful to start... debating on something that is half-baked\".</p><p>The final report - expected next year - \"will be made available to the public\".</p><p>\"The commissioner will [however] advise the president on areas that are of national security sensitivity and how those areas will need to be managed,\" he added in a briefing to journalists.</p><p>The Madlanga Commission is carrying out its work in three phases; the first phase gave witnesses a chance to present their allegations.</p><p>The second phase, currently under way, allows those implicated by evidence given to the inquiry, like Mchunu, to respond to the allegations made against them.</p><p>The final phase will recall witnesses mentioned in the first phase to clarify or make additions to their statements.</p><p>The Madlanga Commission was given six months to complete its work and submit a final report, but this can be extended as the \"president may determine\", according to its terms of reference. It is not clear how long the parliamentary inquiry will run but it too is expected to resume hearings in 2026.</p><p>South Africans will now have to wait until some point next year to read the findings and recommendations from both inquiries. The question they are asking is whether these will be enough to force the government to deal with the problems critics say exist in the police service.</p><p>Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.</p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica</p><p>Jane Ansah is going in a private capacity but reports about the cost and entourage have riled people up.</p><p>The victims, including women and children, were ambushed on their way to a religious festival.</p><p>Those particularly affected are children and pregnant women - some going without food for days.</p><p>Police are investigating the circumstances of the death of 20-year-old Karen Lojore.</p><p>The term is widely used to describe Ghana and Nigeria's wild, end-of-year party seasons.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected President Donald Trump’s request to allow him to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to protect ICE agents, a significant and rare loss for the administration on the conservative court’s emergency docket.</p><p>“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the court said in its unsigned order.</p><p>The decision, which came over dissents from conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, was a substantial setback and appeared almost certain to jeopardize deployments of the National Guard in other cities as well.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, a White House spokeswoman said the ruling will not stop Trump’s efforts to enforce immigration laws, protect federal personnel and “safeguard the American public.”</p><p>“He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNN. “Nothing in today’s ruling detracts from that core agenda.”</p><p>“This is a significant repudiation of President Trump’s efforts to use federal troops to supplement immigration enforcement especially in Democratic-led jurisdictions,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “It’s hard to see how the administration can continue to use this obscure 1908 authority to try to deploy federalized National Guard troops.”</p><p>Vladeck described the decision as “by far the most significant defeat the Supreme Court has handed Trump all year.”</p><p>Hundreds of National Guard troops deployed to Portland and Chicago are being sent home</p><p>Federal law allows a president to federalize the National Guard when he can no longer execute the laws of the United States with “regular forces.” A debate cropped up during the case about whether that term, “regular forces,” meant the regular military or federal agents, such as those who work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>In its order, the court said that the term “likely” refers to the standing military. Further, the court said the ability to federalize the guard under the law Trump attempted to invoke “likely applies only where the military could legally execute the laws.” In other words, the court suggested, it does not apply to protecting agents enforcing immigration laws.</p><p>“Thus, at least in this posture, the government has not carried its burden to show that” the law at issue in the case, “permits the president to federalize the guard in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois,” the court said.</p><p>The decision leaves Trump with few options if he wants to continue to deploy soldiers into cities — but not zero options. It appears likely that the president could still invoke the Insurrection Act, for instance, to deploy regular forces to Chicago and other cities. That may be a politically fraught move, however, because it challenges the longstanding prohibition on the military being used for law enforcement.</p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who sided with the court’s underlying decision, said he would have done so on more narrow grounds. He agreed that the term regular forces means the US military.</p><p>“The court’s legal interpretation, as I understand it, could lead to potentially significant implications for future crises that we cannot now foresee,” Kavanaugh said.</p><p>But he said the court’s decision appeared to bind the court’s hands in potentially unforeseen ways. What if, Kavanaugh hypothesized, an angry crowd gathered outside a federal court house threatening to storm the building. If regular military forces could not deploy in time, the decision appears to bar the president from federalizing the National Guard to deal with that situation, Kavanaugh said.</p><p>“Nearly 250 years ago, the framers of our nation’s Constitution carefully divided responsibility over the country’s militia, today’s U.S. National Guard, between the federal government and the states – believing it impossible that a president would use one state’s militia against another state,” said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, a Democrat.  “The extremely limited circumstances under which the federal government can call up the militia over a state’s objection do not exist in Illinois, and I am pleased that the streets of Illinois will remain free of armed National Guard members as our litigation continues in the courts.”</p><p>Alito, joined by Thomas, wrote that he “strongly” disagreed with the way the court dealt with the case.</p><p>“The court fails to explain why the president’s inherent constitutional authority to protect federal officers and property is not sufficient to justify the use of National Guard members in the relevant area for precisely that purpose,” Alito wrote. “I am not prepared at this point to express a definite view on these questions, but I have serious doubts about the correctness of the court’s views.”</p><p>Alito argued that his colleagues had “no basis for rejecting the president’s determination that he was unable to execute the federal immigration laws using the civilian law enforcement resources at his command.”</p><p>“Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted,” Alito wrote.</p><p>The court’s decision, which landed two months after the Trump administration filed its emergency appeal, came as tensions on the ground at an ICE facility west of Chicago appeared to have eased. The administration told a federal court in a different case weeks ago that “increased coordination” with local police had “reduced the need for federal officers” to engage with protesters at the building in suburban Broadview.</p><p>And defense officials announced in November that they were “rightsizing” planned deployments to Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland. The officials said at that time that only about 300 National Guard units from Illinois would remain ready to deploy. Lower court orders have blocked their ability to conduct operations with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>The court took an unusually long time to resolve the emergency dispute, which the Trump administration first brought to the court in mid-October. Given the unusual amount of back and forth between the justices in Tuesday’s order, it appears likely the court’s conservative majority wrestled with how to resolve the case.</p><p>Though the situation on the ground in Chicago quieted, the administration argued in court papers in November that the deployments were still needed.</p><p>While the case has been pending, the Justice Department told the Supreme Court, “violent assailants have fired shots at DHS agents, thrown bricks and concrete at barricaded agents, and rammed into their vehicles with trucks.”</p><p>In that sense, the emergency appeal remained a major test of the president’s power to mobilize and deploy the guard in American cities.</p><p>The court’s decision came weeks after a shooting in Washington, DC, in late November that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another. The shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who previously worked with the US in Afghanistan. Lakanwal has been charged with several crimes including premeditated murder and assault with intent to kill.</p><p>Trump is using the National Guard in Washington under a different federal law that was not at issue before the Supreme Court.</p><p>Trump had argued that a lower court decision blocking that deployment in Chicago “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property,” effectively inserting the courts into the chain of command.</p><p>The Supreme Court was asked to take up the issue as the administration was attempting to deploy guard members to multiple cities, including Portland, Memphis and Los Angeles.</p><p>A federal district court in Chicago blocked the deployment there in October.</p><p>When the feds come to town: In cities targeted by Trump’s immigration crackdown, a shared playbook emerges</p><p>US District Judge April Perry, nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, said the administration overstepped its authority with the deployment given the conditions on the ground. In a lengthy opinion tied to her short-term order, she questioned the administration’s justification for the troops.</p><p>Perry pointed to what she described as a “troubling trend” of the administration of “equating protests with riots.” The Chicago-based 7th Circuit largely upheld that decision — allowing the administration to federalize the guard members but not deploy them.</p><p>In the Chicago case, Trump had federalized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to “protect officers and federal property.” Another 400 federalized members of the Texas National Guard were also set to be deployed to the state. The administration said those guard members would serve “solely in a protective capacity” and would not engage in law enforcement.</p><p>Under the new arrangement announced in November, about 200 Texas National Guard troops in Chicago were sent home and about 200 more remained on standby at Fort Bliss. Roughly 300 Illinois National Guard troops will remain in the Chicago area.</p><p>Though the case was initially speeding through the courts, the justices slowed things down considerably in late October by ordering additional briefing on a technical but important question about what the law means when it allows a president to use the guard to augment “regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”</p><p>Illinois argued that language meant Trump could call in the guard to help the standing military, not civilian law enforcement agencies like ICE. The Department of Justice countered that reading would be counterintuitive since the standing military is generally barred from executing federal law. The state and the administration spent weeks filing briefs and counter briefs addressing that question.</p><p>To make its case for the deployments, the Justice Department has relied heavily on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 — Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison’s order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court rejected Mott’s argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”</p><p>The states challenging the administration have balked at the suggestion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army.</p><p>This story was updated to include additional reporting.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>It was supposed to be just another Thursday in Laos, where Anthonin's father was born.</p><p>Instead, the 30-year-old French citizen found himself among more than 140 people, mostly tourists, on a ferry that capsized in the Mekong River. All but three are thought to have made it to safety.</p><p>Videos online show a scene of chaos - people screaming for help, children crying and passengers scrambling to get their belongings.</p><p>Anthonin, who declined to give his full name, recalls seeing a mother and her two children on board the ferry - but they were nowhere to be seen on the rescue boat.</p><p>On Monday, Lao media reported that the body of a woman, named Pany Her, had been retrieved from the river. Rescuers then found the body of a one-year-old, who they believe was one of her children. Efforts to find a second child are continuing.</p><p>The boat was making its way last Thursday from the riverside town of Huay Xay to the historic city of Luang Prabang in northern Laos, a common route along the Mekong - and popular with visitors to the country.</p><p>There were 118 tourists and 29 locals, including four crew, on board the boat when it struck underwater rocks near the Tam Ting (Pak Ou) caves, according to an official report carried by the Laotian Times.</p><p>Within minutes, the ferry began to sink.</p><p>\"The [crew] were just totally unprepared for that. There was a lot of confusion... it happened really, really fast,\" Anthonin said.</p><p>\"What was, you know, puzzling and alarming is that there were very few life jackets, around like, 15 life jackets maximum... [it] was really bad.\"</p><p>As the boat continued to capsize, passengers shouted to a passing boat for help, but it did not stop - possibly because, according to him, it was relatively small.</p><p>The second one, however, did stop and take them in. However, according to British tourist Bradley Cook, another passenger on board, that briefly \"made it worse\".</p><p>The 27-year-old told the BBC that as the rescue boat came closer to their ferry, people started to shift and put weight on one side of the ferry, causing water to fill up the hull even quicker.</p><p>Mr Cook went to the other side to climb up on the roof, from where he jumped onto the rescue ferry.</p><p>Some people managed to climb over to the ferry, while others swam for it, hung onto the rails and got pulled up by others.

It was a mess,\" he said. \"[But] I didn't fear for my life...

{"details":"<p>Two people are dead and others are missing after a fire and explosion tore into a nursing home on the outskirts of Philadelphia, spurring local responders, bystanders and staff to rush the elderly population to safety, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said.</p><p>Five people may be missing, Fire Chief Kevin Dippolito said, but officials emphasized the number is preliminary. The number injured is also not immediately clear as patients were taken to multiple hospitals, he said.</p><p>The cause of the explosion remains under investigation, but officials’ preliminary belief is that it was a gas leak, Shapiro said.</p><p>Crews from PECO, the local utility company, responded to reports of a gas odor in the facility shortly after 2 p.m., the company said in a statement.</p><p>“While crews were on site, an explosion occurred at the facility. PECO crews shut off natural gas and electric service to the facility to ensure the safety of first responders and local residents,” the company said, adding they are not sure if their equipment or natural gas was involved in the explosion.</p><p>First responders worked quickly to remove everyone they could find as they still smelled a heavy gas odor, Dippolito said. About 15 to 30 seconds after firefighters left building, there was another explosion and subsequent fire, he said, showing just how dangerous conditions were during the early rescue efforts.</p><p>In addition to the fire, the building suffered major damage as the first floor partially collapsed into the basement, Dippolito said.</p><p>“The explosion was really quite catastrophic,” Shapiro said.</p><p>Officials said it was a massive effort by everyone on scene to save people inside quickly, describing scenes of pulling people out of windows, staircases and elevator shafts.</p><p>“There was one police officer who literally threw two people over his shoulders and ran with people to help,” Dippolito said.</p><p>Bristol Health & Rehab Center, formerly known as the Silver Lake Nursing Home, said in a Facebook post local authorities were responding to the facility and they would post updates when warranted. It is located about 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia in Bristol Township.</p><p>Harry S. Truman High School is being used as a reunification center for those displaced by the fire, said Christopher Polzer, assistant superintendent of Bristol Township School District.</p><p>Tuesday’s fiery explosion drew an all-hands effort as neighbors flocked to help and officers from as far as three municipalities away showed up to lend rescue assistance.</p><p>The explosion occurred at 2:19 p.m., immediately lighting up radios with calls of the disaster, according to Dippolito. Within minutes, firefighters were on scene and started pulling people out of the compromised building, he said.</p><p>Images from the scene show a large black plume of smoke billowing from the roof as emergency vehicles surrounded the building.</p><p>The people who were rescued “were being brought out by the fire department were handed off to the police officers, which came from every direction, and I believe every municipality around here and were literally carrying the patients,” according to Dippolito.</p><p>First responders were able to rescue two people from the collapsed basement just before the second explosion hit, Dippolito said.</p><p>That explosion and the subsequent fire “actually helped us identify where the leak was coming from in the basement, and we just prevented it from spreading into other parts of the building,” Dippolito said.</p><p>Shapiro praised first responders, saying in the initial response to the incident, “you saw what real heroism is all about.”</p><p>Bristol Health & Rehab Center, where Tuesday’s fatal explosion took place, changed ownership at the beginning of December, Shapiro said.</p><p>On December 10, the Pennsylvania Department of Health visited the facility, where a plan was put in place to “upgrade the standards at this facility,” he said. He didn’t elaborate on what upgrades needed to be made or the details of the plan.</p><p>“That work will obviously continue with the new owners to ensure that they do what is necessary to keep residents safe at this facility and at the others where they are being taken to,” Shapiro said.</p><p>CNN has reached out to Bristol Health & Rehab Center for more information on Tuesday’s explosion and on the plan. CNN has also reached out to the Pennsylvania Department of Health for more information.</p><p>This story has been updated with additional information.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

{"details":"<p>Russia launched one of its largest aerial attacks this month on Ukraine overnight, killing at least three people and injuring at least 17 others, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky, as Ukraine’s leader received his first face-to-face briefing with his negotiating team on their arrival back from talks in the US.</p><p>“Russia has been carrying out a massive attack on Ukraine,” Zelensky posted on X, adding that more than 650 drones and over 30 missiles were used in the strike. Some 13 regions, about half the country, came under attack, he said.</p><p>In the western region of Zhytomyr, a 4-year-old child was killed after a Russian drone struck a residential building, Zelensky said.</p><p>Meanwhile, emergency power cuts were imposed across the country with some regions left almost completely without power due to the attack, according to Ukraine’s energy ministry.</p><p>The latest bombardment comes after a fresh round of talks to end the war wrapped over the weekend in Miami, where Ukrainian and Russian officials met separately with a US delegation led by White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump.</p><p>On the ground, Kyiv’s troops retreated from the town of Siversk in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, according to the country’s armed forces, as Russian forces pushed through “active offensive operations.”</p><p>Ukrainian solders withdrew from the area in Donetsk to “save the lives of our soldiers and maintain the combat capability of our units,” the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement.</p><p>“The invaders were able to advance thanks to their significant numerical superiority and constant pressure” despite “difficult weather conditions,” Ukraine’s Armed Forces added.</p><p>Moscow broke through swathes of the city this week after a lightning offensive along eastern frontlines over the summer. Even so, Ukrainian troops have maintained “fire control” of Siversk and Russian units are “being blocked,” the country’s armed forces said Tuesday.</p><p>“All measures are being taken to reduce the offensive potential of enemy units,” the statement said.</p><p>Ukraine’s delegation arrived back in Kyiv overnight and delivered what Zelensky called a “detailed report” of the talks.</p><p>“Not everything is perfect so far, but this plan is in place,” Ukraine’s leader wrote on X overnight, referring to the 20-point document, which forms the core of an agreement framework between Ukraine and the US.</p><p>In addition to the core plan, which include security guarantees “between us, the Europeans, and the United States,” Zelensky wrote, there is an additional document detailing bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US. On this latter point, he said, “we are very close to a real outcome.”</p><p>Along with security guarantees, previous rounds of talks have also highlighted the centrality of territory in negotiations, and Zelensky made no comment in statements overnight on any readiness to discuss possible land swaps.</p><p>Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a clear indication that he will not compromise on his demands for Ukraine to cede territory in the Donbas, despite the Trump administration’s intensifying push for peace.</p><p>In an apparent attempt to tamp down expectations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian newspaper Izvestia on Monday that talks between Russian and US officials over the weekend should not be considered as a breakthrough.</p><p>“This is a working process. We already said that first there needs to be quite a meticulous work process at the expert level,” Peskov said.</p><p>Witkoff, who led the US delegation at the Miami talks, said Russia “remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine” after meeting with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) and a Kremlin special envoy, at the weekend.</p><p>He made a similarly worded statement after talks with the Ukrainian delegation. “Ukraine remains fully committed to achieving a just and sustainable peace,” Witkoff said, while noting that their meeting was “constructive” and included discussions about the “sequencing of next steps.”</p><p>Away from the Florida talks, Zelensky put Ukraine’s military on alert for potential Russian attacks around Christmas while pointing out the lack of air defenses available to defend the country.</p><p>Ukrainian men risking death to avoid the frontline</p><p>The Ukrainian leader said the most recent attack “sends an extremely clear signal about Russia’s priorities.”</p><p>It was an attack “ahead of Christmas, when people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe,” he said. “An attack carried out essentially in the midst of negotiations aimed at ending this war.”</p><p>CNN’s Hira Humayun, Nina Subkhanberdina, Tim Lister and Sana Noor Haq contributed reporting.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Traditionally a night for celebration, the Christmas Eve holiday takes on a pall amid expanded immigration enforcement</p><p>For many Latinos, Nochebuena — the night before Christmas — shines brighter than most holidays.</p><p>Central Americans typically spend the evening feasting on tamales. Caribbean families may eat lechón, or pork shoulder, with a side of black rice and beans. Families from the Philippines, which was colonized by Spain for hundreds of years, celebrate with favorites like pancit or fruit salad.</p><p>This year, increased immigration enforcement across the country has cast a shadow on the holiday for many Latino families.</p><p>The Washington Post spoke with families across the country about how they’re navigating Nochebuena.</p><p>Some are trying to find new meaning in Nochebuena or are adopting new traditions. Others, like Anthony Guevara, are expecting much smaller celebrations. He typically reunites with more than 100 relatives at his parents’ home in Northern Virginia for the holiday. This year, he and his sibling are meeting their mother, who was deported to El Salvador, in Spain for a smaller celebration. “It’s going to be a little lonelier than usual,” Guevara said.</p><p>Here are their stories.</p><p>For years, the Cortes family’s Nochebuena spilled out of their small Southern California apartment — a night thick with the scent of masa, meat and simmering broth. Patriarch Francisco swayed to songs by Los Pasteles Verdes and the sound of cumbia while helping in the kitchen.</p><p>By nightfall, the table was overflowing with food. The tree glowed. The ceiling shimmered with hanging ornaments. And for a few hours each Christmas Eve, everything in their world — the two parents who came from Guerrero, Mexico, nearly four decades ago, the six children they raised here, the grandchildren underfoot — fit inside that bright, crowded room.</p><p>This year, however, Nochebuena will be quieter and dimmer. The speaker that once played Los Pasteles Verdes hasn’t been touched. The kitchen won’t filled with tamales waiting to be steamed. Their mother hung the window lights, the strands of color her husband once helped unravel, by herself.</p><p>On Nov. 5, immigration agents detained Francisco outside his workplace, a produce market, as he waited for his son to pick him up.</p><p>Araceli, Francisco’s daughter, said their mother, who is also undocumented, barely leaves home anymore. “She’s scared,” she said. “They’ve never been apart.”</p><p>Instead of a feast, the family plans to spend Christmas Eve at Mass, then together at home, holding one another close.</p><p>“We’re not losing faith,” Jacqueline said. “My dad was our protector. Now it’s our turn to protect him.”</p><p>His immigration hearing is scheduled for Dec. 24.</p><p>Katelyn Coe will be celebrating Nochebuena for the first time this year.</p><p>Her husband’s Mexican family celebrated the holiday but, at home in Alabama, he and Coe celebrated Christmas “the American way,” she said. Most of their five children, who range from a newborn to a 12-year-old, still believe in Santa Claus and expect to get “everything they want” on Christmas morning, Coe said.</p><p>But this year, they’re missing Coe’s husband, Santiago Benitez, who was detained and deported to Mexico earlier this year.</p><p>Two of their children now live in Mexico with Benitez while the rest live with Coe in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Her 12-year-old daughter is “so used to the American way of life” that she didn’t want to move to Mexico, Coe said.</p><p>Coe, a registered nurse, said she is hoping to secure her nursing license in California where she can live closer to the border and travel into Mexico to visit her husband and children regularly. “It’s a big adjustment, but we have to do what we have to do to keep our family together,” she said.</p><p>But in the meantime, she is excited to explore some new holiday traditions, Coe said. The family will be reunited in Hildago, Mexico, for Christmas where her children, who are all U.S. citizens, will celebrate a traditional Nochebuena for the first time, including watching a posada, a procession reenacting the story of Mary and Joseph seeking lodging on Christmas Eve.</p><p>It will be a learning experience, Coe said.</p><p>In his grandmother’s El Paso home — crowded, loud and alive — Genaro Villa, a 34-year-old U.S. citizen, feels closest to his heritage. His father was the son of a bracero, born in El Paso after his grandfather came north to work the agricultural fields. His mother, born in Durango, Mexico, paid someone $50 to push her across the Rio Grande in a tire in the 1980s.</p><p>Every year, Villa — an economist living in Virginia — flies home on Christmas Eve. He lands just in time to join his mother and sisters for Mass at the Immaculate Conception Church in Berino, New Mexico, before heading about 20 miles south to his grandmother’s house in El Paso, where the men huddle outside in the cold, drinking beer as they boil tamales in steaming pots. Inside, his aunts fry buñuelos — thin disks of dough that puff and curl in the oil before being dusted with cinnamon and sugar.</p><p>“That’s a big part, the food,” he said.</p><p>By nightfall, cousins crowd into the living room, kids tug at gift ribbons and the elders — his abuela and abuelo, both in their late 80s — sit at the center, “the magnet that really keeps us, you know, coming back.”</p><p>For Villa, this year’s celebration carries extra weight. Anger about immigration raids has strengthened his family’s resolve to celebrate and take pride in the journey that brought them to the United States, he said.</p><p>So during Mass, he’ll pray for those who, unlike his family, can’t be with their loved ones this Christmas.</p><p>“We can’t really do much about it,” he said. “So we just have to pray, celebrate our roots and help people in any way we can.”</p><p>Then at midnight, they are adding a new tradition: a tequila shot.</p><p>He’ll raise his glass to those on the other side of the border — and to everyone still here.</p><p>By Nov. 13, Osman Zapata, 46, was ready to celebrate his favorite time of year. That afternoon, he and his wife unpacked the boxes from their Orlando garage and drove to the store for more decorations — a gingerbread-man platter, festive bowls, new ornaments to hang on the tree.</p><p>The plan was to decorate the house together, as they always did.</p><p>They never got the chance.</p><p>The next morning, Osman — who owns a car rental business and drives for rideshare apps on the side — was parked at Orlando Sanford International Airport, waiting for a passenger, when ICE agents knocked on his window. He showed them his work permit and Social Security number. But they told him it didn’t matter, said his 21-year-old daughter, Laura.</p><p>“The officers just said ‘If you’re not a citizen or permanent resident, we have to take you,’” she said.</p><p>The Zapatas had left Medellín, Colombia, in 2022, entering the U.S. legally with tourist visas before filing for asylum. Their case was still pending. Osman had built a life here — buying a home, opening a business, watching his daughters go to college — all while keeping their Colombian traditions alive.</p><p>Each Nochebuena, the family filled the table with pernil, lechona, sancocho, buñuelos and natilla, unwrapping gifts from el Niño Dios — baby Jesus — at midnight.</p><p>Now, with him gone, they feared they’d spend his favorite holiday with an empty chair at the table.</p><p>Laura cried for days. On Nov. 16, she walked into church for the first time since leaving Colombia.</p><p>“The priest stood in front of me and my sister,” she recalled, “and said he felt a strong calling from God — that the person we were praying for would soon be with us again. He didn’t even know what had happened. I took it as a sign.”</p><p>So the family kept believing. They decorated the house — tree, garlands, table — but left the outdoor lights dark. “My mom said, we have to get the house ready for when he comes home,” Laura said.</p><p>On Dec. 1, a judge reviewed a stack of letters from co-workers, neighbors, and friends testifying to Osman’s kindness, hard work and community ties.</p><p>He was released on bond.</p><p>A friend drove Osman home in time for the family to celebrate Día de las Velitas — the “Day of the Little Candles” — together. In Colombia, the night marks the start of the Christmas season, when families light candles in honor of the Virgin Mary and to give thanks for the year ahead. For the Zapatas, it felt like the first spark of hope returning.</p><p>The ordeal, Laura said, changed the way she saw the holiday. “We’ve talked about this a lot, but it’s been a calling to not focus on the materialistic things, because the most important gift isn’t under the tree — it’s being together.”</p><p>About this story</p><p>Reporting by María Luisa Paúl and Rachel Hatzipanagos.

He didn’t even know what had happened. I took it as a sign.”</p><p>So the family kept believing. They decorated the house — tree, garlands, table — but left the outdoor lights dark. “My mom said, we have to get the house ready for when he comes home,” Laura said.</p><p>On Dec. 1, a judge reviewed a stack of letters from co-workers, neighbors, and friends testifying to Osman’s kindness, hard work and community ties.</p><p>He was released on bond.</p><p>A friend drove Osman home in time for the family to celebrate Día de las Velitas — the “Day of the Little Candles” — together. In Colombia, the night marks the start of the Christmas season, when families light candles in honor of the Virgin Mary and to give thanks for the year ahead. For the Zapatas, it felt like the first spark of hope returning.</p><p>The ordeal, Laura said, changed the way she saw the holiday. “We’ve talked about this a lot, but it’s been a calling to not focus on the materialistic things, because the most important gift isn’t under the tree — it’s being together.”</p><p>About this story</p><p>Reporting by María Luisa Paúl and Rachel Hatzipanagos.

{"details":"<p>Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”</p><p>The holidays are a time of gratitude, connection and celebration, but it can also be physically demanding and mentally draining.</p><p>Simple mind-body strategies woven throughout your day can help you avoid that fate, supporting your energy, digestion and nervous system from morning through bedtime.</p><p>The holidays can be stressful and anxiety-inducing. How to make them fun again</p><p>The 12 tips below require no equipment and take just minutes each — but they can make the difference between ending your holiday depleted or refreshed.</p><p>1. Lay the groundwork with deep breathing: Before the day gets busy, spend a few minutes focused on establishing long, deep diaphragmatic breaths. You can do this before getting out of bed, seated in a chair, or lying on your back with knees bent in a breathing bridge.</p><p>Place your hands on your lower ribs to guide and monitor their movement. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your ribs expand outward. Then exhale fully, drawing your ribs back inward. Try to double the length of your exhale — if you inhale for four counts, exhale for eight.</p><p>Deep breathing with extended exhales activates your parasympathetic nervous system — your body’s “rest and digest” mode — and sets a calm, focused tone for the hours ahead.</p><p>2. Hydrate strategically: Reach for a glass of water before that first cup of coffee. Your body has been fasting all night, and starting with hydration helps you recover from overnight dehydration. Research shows that proper hydration supports cognitive function and energy levels, and plays an essential role in digestion.</p><p>Continue sipping water as you go about your morning tasks, especially if you’re drinking coffee or tea in large quantities, which can be dehydrating. If you plan on drinking alcohol later in the day, getting ahead on hydration early helps. Also try to drink a full glass of water for every cocktail or glass of wine you consume.</p><p>3. Move through a full-body mobility flow: Before you get into full swing in the kitchen, spend five minutes gently mobilizing your major joints with a quick yoga flow or by doing a few circles in each direction with your ankles, hips and arms and then rotating side to side through your mid-back.</p><p>Doing so primes your nervous system and lubricates your joints for the standing, lifting and sitting ahead. Think of it as warming up for an athletic event — because in many ways, the holidays are like one.</p><p>4. Build in kitchen stretches. Between tasks — while the potatoes boil or the pies bake — pause for 30-second stretches. Reach both arms overhead and lean gently side to side. Interlace your fingers behind your back and gently lift your hands to open your chest. Take a seat and place an ankle on top of your opposite thigh in a figure-four position and lean slightly forward to stretch your hip and low back.</p><p>Remember that breathing is your stress-relieving superpower, so breathe deeply through each stretch. These micro-breaks prevent the cumulative tension that comes from repetitive chopping, stirring and hovering over the stove.</p><p>5. Lift heavy items with intention: When you’re wrestling that 20-pound turkey out of the oven or moving a heavy stockpot, hinge at your hips rather than rounding your spine. Keep the load close to your body, engage your core and use your legs to generate force. Doing so distributes the work across larger muscle groups and protects your lower back from strain.</p><p>6. Check in with your body: Every time the kitchen timer goes off, use it as a reminder to scan your body for tension, imbalance and fatigue. Ding — the casserole is done? Great, take care of the food and then notice how you’re feeling. Are your shoulders creeping toward your ears? Your weight shifted into one hip? Your jaw clenched? Feet or lower back asking for a break?</p><p>Simply becoming aware of these sensations allows you to make small adjustments — whether that’s moving and stretching, shifting your weight, or taking a seat for a moment of deep breathing — that can prevent minor discomfort from becoming major.</p><p>7. Take a premeal breathing pause: Just before eating, take five slow, intentional breaths. Follow this 5-7-3 pattern: Inhale for a count of five, exhale for a count of seven and pause for three counts after the exhale.</p><p>Again, breathing is transformative. It transitions your body into your nervous system’s parasympathetic mode, which optimizes digestive function and helps you eat more slowly and mindfully.</p><p>8. Eat with awareness: Put your fork down between bites. Chew thoroughly. Notice the flavors, textures and the point at which you feel satisfied rather than stuffed. Research shows that eating slowly reduces overall intake and improves digestion, helping you avoid the post-meal discomfort that can derail your evening. And especially if you spent all morning cooking, make sure you’re savoring what you created rather than rushing through it.</p><p>One small thing you can do for healthier food and exercise over holiday travel</p><p>9. Move after eating: Within 20 minutes of finishing your meal, take a 10-minute walk, even if it’s just around the house or yard. Light movement supports digestion and reduces blood sugar spikes. If weather permits, consider getting everyone outside for a family activity such as a backyard kickball game — something that gets everyone moving together.</p><p>Even simple movements from the comfort of your couch will help. Try a seated pillow twist: Sit tall, squeezing a pillow between your knees and holding another pillow in your hands at chest height. Exhale as you rotate from your mid-back to the right side, touching the pillow to the couch seat as far behind you as you can reach. Inhale back to center and repeat on the other side. Alternate through 10 to 20 repetitions.</p><p>10. Create a simple wind-down ritual: After a day of hosting, cooking and socializing, your nervous system needs time to settle. An hour before bed, dim the lights and step away from screens. Consider a warm bath or light reading — anything that lowers stimulation and invites your nervous system to settle. This preparation for bed is considered a sleep hygiene practice. It’s something you should do every night but particularly after such a full day.</p><p>11. Release accumulated tension: Your body has been working hard all day. Practice a few bedtime yoga moves to help release any lingering discomfort and tightness in your back, hips and shoulders.</p><p>At the very least, unwind tension with a single-leg bent-knee twist on your bed: Lie on your back hugging both knees into your chest. Extend your right leg long on the bed and then take your left knee across your body to the right side, rotating from your mid-back to stack your hips. Reach your left arm out to the left to complete the twist. Take three long, deep breaths. Then repeat on the other side.</p><p>7 expert-approved foot massagers to help relieve tension (Courtesy CNN Underscored)</p><p>12. Ground your nervous system: End your day with progressive muscle relaxation combined with deep breathing. Starting at your feet and moving up through your body, cover each area: feet, lower legs, upper legs, hips and glutes, belly and low back, chest and upper back, hands, lower arms, upper arms, shoulders, neck, and face. Systematically inhale as you tense each muscle group for five seconds, then exhale deeply to release.</p><p>This body scan reinforces your mind-body connection, releases residual tension and promotes restorative sleep, so you can wake up ready to tackle Black Friday.</p><p>The holidays can be demanding, but they don’t have to deplete you. By weaving small moments of breath, movement and awareness into your day, you’ll finish the holidays feeling lighter, more present and genuinely grateful — not just for the meal, but for the support and resilience of your own body.</p><p>Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.

{"details":"<p>The US town of Bristol, population around 44,000, is a divided community.</p><p>Split between Virginia and Tennessee, the state line runs literally down main street. While both sides have much in common, there is one major difference - abortion is illegal in Tennessee. This has been the case since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling which gave individual states, rather than the federal government, the power to legislate abortion, triggering 12 states to pass near-total bans.</p><p>So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.</p><p>But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.</p><p>\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.</p><p>\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"</p><p>On 22 December, Bristol's Circuit Court will hear the clinic's case against an eviction notice served by their landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King in April 2024.</p><p>Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.</p><p>This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:</p><p>\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"</p><p>Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.</p><p>The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.</p><p>Since Roe v Wade was overturned, states where abortions are legal have become destinations for out-of-state abortion seekers, with 155,000 people crossing state lines last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute (GI).</p><p>The organisation also found that over 9,200 people travelled to Virginia alone to have the procedure done last year.</p><p>\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"</p><p>Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".</p><p>Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple: If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?</p><p>\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"</p><p>The Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.</p><p>\"Why would this not extend to unborn life?\" asked Ms Cobb.</p><p>Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.</p><p>Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".</p><p>\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.</p><p>The debate became heated in Bristol, as the council agreed to look into the matter.</p><p>\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.</p><p>Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit.</p><p>Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson.</p><p>The pastor has lobbied councils across the US to enforce the Comstock Act, a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion.</p><p>Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.</p><p>Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.</p><p>\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:</p><p>\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"</p><p>Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.</p><p>\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"</p><p>Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.</p><p>The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.</p><p>Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.</p><p>The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

Others have switched to Secret Santa for one family member or their kids. “I cannot put into words how much of a relief it is to buy for two adults and two cousins instead of all the siblings, spouses and eight kids,” Hannah Sampson says.</p><p>“I like the ‘sometimes’ framing — sometimes I do want to exchange gifts, sometimes we just have too much stuff and not enough fresh ideas,” Jenny Rogers says.</p><p>Anne Branigin and her friends have been rethinking what they mean by gifting. It’s not necessarily something you buy in a store: “These approaches win you back some flexibility and agency during a season that can be really rigid and demanding.” And when it works, it can be magic, creating “the moment when you (the gifter) get confirmation that you’ve absolutely nailed it.”</p><p>That being said, there are the Christmas Eve shoppers who knock out the entire list in a few insane hours. We’re not judging you as long as you don’t yell at anyone.</p><p>They are theoretically modeled after the charm and traditions of European markets, but they’re actually arts fairs with tinsel. In the cold. But we digress.</p><p>“Did you love the holiday market last year?” Amy Argetsinger asks. “That’s great! Because all your favorites are back again this year. The same Tibetan mitten stand. The same artisanal soap kiosk. The same lady recycling old license plates into bespoke picture frames and purses. The same guy lopping off a wedge of Gouda for you with an illegal-looking machete. The same cat magnets, New Yorker puzzles and golden retriever socks. The same jewelry makers with pleading eyes, ready to make a deal. The line for cocoa and churros is only 20 minutes long, if you get there early. And yet … you will always go back.”</p><p>Don’t get us started on this annual, worldwide bar crawl where thousands of people dressed as Santa get blasted for charity. Mari-Jane Williams took her daughter’s Girl Scout troop to New York to see the holiday decorations. “We didn’t realize it was SantaCon. All we saw, everywhere: drunk Santas. The girls were so baffled. In a pizza place, a Santa passed out, face in pizza. Another had puked all over the bathroom. We still talk about it.”</p><p>Speaking of Santa, remember the days when parents dressed up the kids to sit on his lap? The bad old days with long lines, scary elves and crying babies? Sure you do. Letters (Emails? Talking with AI versions?) are more efficient and far less traumatic. Ashley Fetters Maloy loved visiting Santa “until the year I showed Santa my Christmas list and he laughed at how I had written ‘1 goldfish.’ Immediate and eternal vendetta.”</p><p>Crowded, cold, too many selfies and not enough soul. “I’m a festive person generally, but I am the old Scrooge at the overpriced display of dancing Christmas lights,” Amy Parlapiano says. “We went to one in Brooklyn a few years ago, and my husband was asked to retake a stranger’s picture under a sprawling and very crowded tunnel of twinkle lights multiple times to achieve the desired angle. It was also freezing.”</p><p>In the good old days, a dive bar would throw a tinsel garland and some colored lights behind the bar and call it a day. Now there are elaborate displays, selfie booths and even an Elf on the Shelf pop-up bar. You don’t have to be drunk to enjoy them, but it helps. “Overwrought Christmas-themed bars that feel less joyful and more like a cash grab are the least favorite,” Fritz Hahn says.</p><p>We know, we know: It’s wasteful, expensive, non-sustainable. Sometimes the results are woeful. Just like there are Charlie Brown trees, there are Charlie Brown packages. And remember that time the cat ate the ribbon and required a $3,000 surgery? I do.</p><p>But there is no other time of the year when a beautifully wrapped package sits unwrapped for days, a glistening jewel of anticipation, generosity and love. “I love everything about wrapping gifts: picking the paper, curling the ribbon, finding the right bow and coordinating a cute tag,” Sampson says. “It’s so satisfying. Who even cares what’s inside?”</p><p>You loved it as a kid, especially when Santa left a Barbie Dreamhouse or Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle under the tree. As an adult, it can be great or awkward, especially when someone gives you a really thoughtful gift and you give them … a fruit basket. Or nothing. It’s never really about the things, it’s about the people exchanging them — which makes it all the more fraught. You can’t always get what you want, but sometimes you get what you need (socks). Or exactly what you asked for, but where’s the joy in that?</p><p>“I love receiving and giving gifts. Nothing quite like getting a gift from someone like, say, a sister-in-law and feeling so unexpectedly seen,” Rachel Kurzius says. “But I will say, last year my husband and I agreed that we wouldn’t exchange holiday gifts with each other, and to be on the same page about that felt like the most sublime gift of all! What a relief!”</p><p>Lovely to get, impossible for everyone but the most organized people to pull off. Each heartfelt missive delivered by the mail carrier is a reminder that the sender is a thoughtful friend who wishes you kind holiday greetings. And they bought stamps and went to the post office. And you did not, even if you thought about it. Guilty as charged.</p><p>Awkward forced festivity with people you don’t really know? Even if you love your co-workers (lucky you), proceed with caution. Office gift exchanges are never a good idea. Receptions? Dinner? The potential for getting your tinsel in a tangle is high, especially if there’s an open bar. (How many women are still mad about the “Love Actually” office party subplot?) Remember it’s still work and you’ll be fine.</p><p>The goofier the better. Lights? Fun! Bad puns? Even better. (Profanity? Only at frat parties.) Your holiday wardrobe solved in one fell swoop.</p><p>Beautiful, hypnotic, iconic. Especially for the tiny little dancers prancing around onstage in tutus who — if they are related to you — were the most perfect ever, and we have the shaky phone video to prove it. If not — well, maybe a little less exciting after the second or 10th viewing. Related obligatory celebrations: school and church pageants, which are even more chaotic and adorable.</p><p>From sacred to silly, it’s inescapable during the season. Increasingly, before the season: Hearing carols before Thanksgiving and after Christmas is cruel and unusual punishment for millions of traditionalists, whereas holiday fanatics like to jingle 24-7. Everyone has a sentimental favorite — and a bête noire. True story: My father snapped our 45 RPM record of Alvin and the Chipmunks’ “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late)” in half after my brother and I played it a mere hundred times in a row. What seemed like an overreaction at the time is entirely reasonable in retrospect.</p><p>Sure, the “Hallelujah” chorus of Handel’s “Messiah” has become the holiday version of “Sweet Caroline” at Red Sox games: a full-throated ballad of unity where singing talent plays second fiddle to enthusiasm. Even the basic sing-along concert of secular songs invites the shy, the untalented, the humbugs to throw embarrassment to the side and join the fun. So good, so good.</p><p>Let’s stipulate that the prefab kits from the supermarket are as fun — if not as beautiful — as the Martha Stewart extravaganzas on Pinterest. Better, perhaps, because building anything out of frosting and candy while consuming the same is a messy, kid-friendly, memory-making mess. Wonky roof? Expected. Coconut snow? Marshmallow snowmen? Sublime. Finally, an affordable starter home.</p><p>Greed, riches, poverty. Good and evil, compassion and indifference. And ghosts. Timeless and timely, Dickens’s cautionary tale hits a little differently every year and never gets old.</p><p>There are sugar plums, and then there are dumplings. “In Jewish families, the Chinese food order is sacred,” says Gabe Hiatt, referring to the tradition that began when most restaurants were closed on Christmas. “During a season that can feel especially exclusionary, the Chinese restaurant accepts us as we are: hungry for soup. The guise of a holiday gives us an excuse to overorder, with visions of leftover pot stickers dancing in our heads. There’s no need for Christmas turkey. But a lacquered duck? Pass the pancakes, please.”</p><p>Other nontraditional favorites: Jada Yuan goes to the Farolito Walk in Santa Fe or the bonfires at the Taos Pueblo on Christmas Eve. And Naveen Kumar opts for a Christmas Eve bar crawl with friends down Christopher Street in New York’s West Village. “There is such a lovely vibe — semi-sleepy, but very cozy and jovial. There’s nothing quite like it, as though we’re waiting for Santa with chosen family.”</p><p>The nectar of December. Yes, it’s bad for you: too much sugar, booze, fat. But it’s delicious (the White House makes a legendary version) and a socially acceptable way to drink during the family dinner without raising eyebrows.</p><p>Sampson and her husband (both big “Elf” fans) made a calendar of a holiday movie or episode to watch every night in December leading up to Christmas. Samantha Chery’s family gathers every year for her dad’s favorite, “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer”: “It’s kooky, it’s frivolous, it’s everything one could hope for in a classic Christmas film.” Maura Judkis is a huge fan of “The Muppet Christmas Carol.” “It is the best — and I am willing to say only — version that people should watch. Michael Caine is playing Scrooge, surrounded by puppets, as if he were interacting with members of the Royal Shakespeare Company.”</p><p>Perhaps the darkest Christmas movie is also the most beloved. “The only holiday experience that ever lives up to the hype is rewatching ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’” Monica Hesse says. “George Bailey gets older, but so do you. Every annual viewing is a chance to think about the dreams you had to give up and the dreams you had to reimagine. None of us end up achieving everything our childhood selves thought we would. Being content with what we achieved instead isn’t just about the meaning of Christmas — it’s about the meaning of life.”</p><p>They’re the TV equivalent of a golden retriever: super cute and dumb as a rock. Good prevails, love conquers all, and every problem is solved in two hours. Even better, they don’t require thought or introspection or even much attention, just the low hum of suspended reality.</p><p>There is something timeless and utterly charming about houses adorned in Christmas cheer — a simple way of sharing a bit of sparkle and goodwill with friends, neighbors and even complete strangers. From the single strand of lights hanging on a balcony for dear life to the massive front-yard illuminations and inflatable Santas, it’s all kind of great. For the price of gas, anyone can pile into the car, blast some carols on the radio and slowly drive through the streets admiring the show.</p><p>Real or fake? Big or small? White or colored lights? Heirloom or decorator-designed ornaments? Twinkle lights on the houseplant? Opinions are strong, but there’s no wrong answer. The actual trimming can be either (a) a massive undertaking, especially to prevent the dogs and cats from breaking everything, or (b) a festive project best accompanied by hot chocolate and reminiscence about every ornament. It’s the sentimental centerpiece of the holiday, and it’s worth every minute.</p><p>Even the Grinch couldn’t resist. Baking, decorating, gifting, nibbling: a little pillow of sugary love, the stuff of memories and family tradition. Everyone has a favorite Christmas cookie, and they’re all the best. (Actually, that’s not true: Gingerbread cookies are the best. Bite me.)</p><p>“When I was in elementary school, we had two dogs, Snoopy and Pubber, who liked to relieve themselves on anything in sight, including the freshly constructed snowmen in the backyard,” Williams says. “Our snowmen were always yellow around the bottom.” So each year, her dad would add a smear of yellow icing at the bottom of the snowmen sugar cookies. “My brother and I thought this was hilarious, as kids that age do, and my kids always loved hearing this story. I’ve continued the cookie-decorating tradition as an adult. Each year, my mom, my two kids and I get together and churn out colorful candy canes, stockings, Christmas sweaters and, yes, snowmen.”</p><p>With yellow icing, because it wouldn’t be Christmas without it.</p><p>Design and development by Emma Kumer.</p>","headline":"23 Christmas traditions ranked, from cookies to shopping hell","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/interactive/2025/christmas-traditions-activities-lights-tree/","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-12-21T10:00:11.135Z"}

{"details":"<p>Baby Reindeer was one of the standout television moments of the past few years and it catapulted actress Jessica Gunning to stardom.</p><p>She played the obsessive and troubled woman, Martha, who dramatically unravels onscreen.</p><p>For Gunning it was the \"role of a lifetime\", describing life as a \"surreal\" but also a \"dream\" since the show's release.</p><p>\"I got goose bumps when I first read the script,\" the British actress tells the BBC, adding she had five auditions for the role.</p><p>But she thought the television series might have been an indie hit, not the phenomenon on Netflix it became.</p><p>Of course, a potential downside of starring in a show like that does mean you get stopped in the street and occasionally confused with your character.</p><p>\"I'd just parked near where I live and a woman screamed in my face! But in her defence she had just finished the series, walked out of her home and there I was.</p><p>\"So that's surreal, occasionally being screamed at,\" she says.</p><p>\"But everyone has been so lovely, there's also an incredible statistic about the difference the show has made to charities, especially ones for male survivors of sexual assault.</p><p>\"I think it shows people want complicated stories. I have had 14-year-olds come and talk to me about it, as well as 90-year-olds.\"</p><p>Anyone who has watched Baby Reindeer may tell you it can be a difficult and upsetting watch.</p><p>The show says it was based on real-life events experienced by the show's creator, Richard Gadd, who also plays the lead character.</p><p>But this is disputed by the woman who allegedly inspired the person Martha is based on, who has said Netflix told \"brutal lies\" about her to more than 50 million viewers around the world.</p><p>She said in June 2024 she was suing Netflix for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.</p><p>The show is billed as \"a true story\", but a judge concluded in his ruling in September 2024 that certain key events in the series, like the conviction for stalking, did not happen in real life.</p><p>Netflix failed in its attempt to persuade the judge to throw out the legal case brought against it, but said: \"We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story.\"</p><p>Filming such an intense drama has given Gadd and Gunning a \"unique bond\" the actress says.</p><p>\"We always checked in with each other and the producers and director made sure everything felt safe and considered.\"</p><p>Baby Reindeer started life as a stage show at the Fringe at Edinburgh, Gunning had tried to see but couldn't get tickets so bought the play text instead.</p><p>\"That was a little bit Martha of me\" she laughs.</p><p>Her persistence paid off, and Gunning swept up during award season, winning an Emmy, a Bafta, a Golden Globe, an RTS and a Screen Actors Guild award.</p><p>\"It's all been a bit pinch me, for all of the cast and crew really, we were out in LA, which is just crazy anyway to be in Hollywood. All the clichés are true, even to be nominated is an honour.</p><p>\"Sometimes I look at the shelf that has my awards on and I think 'Oh my gosh', it feels like a dream really.\"</p><p>Gunning has been in the industry for almost two decades, but Baby Reindeer has been a life-changing experience.</p><p>\"I feel like on the one hand my life has completely changed, but I also feel exactly the same in a good way.\"</p><p>\"I feel like if something like Baby Reindeer happened straight after coming out of drama school, maybe I'd feel like a bit of a deer in the headlights, pardon the pun.</p><p>\"Now I feel a lot more grounded and I've got a big group of family and friends. But it is kind of strange, the number of viewers that Netflix bring in, you can't really compute. If you think about it too much it can feel a little bit scary.\"</p><p>She is well aware of the significance of the role saying: \"I waited 17 years for a part like Martha to come along, so hopefully it won't be another 17 years.\"</p><p>Gunning will next be on-screen on Christmas Eve, in the BBC One and Children In Need animation Pudsey and the Thread of Hope.</p><p>It is based on an original story by McFly star and composer for the Paddington muscial Tom Fletcher, who's also written the music for the cartoon.</p><p>Gunning plays a woman grieving for her husband, while her son is also navigating his way through grief.</p><p>It is a handbrake turn after Baby Reindeer, but Gunning says the script was \"beautiful\" and she wanted to be involved \"in the special charity\".</p><p>\"Children can deal with big issues like this, and hopefully children will watch and feel seen if they've experienced this, or are going through something similar.\"</p><p>\"All my life I've grown up with Children In Need, I went to school dressed up as an Emu and wore it all day.\"</p><p>So what next for Gunning?</p><p>She's starring alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield in a film adaptation of Enid Blyton's much-loved children's book, The Magic Faraway Tree, and is filming a comedy with Angelina Jolie.</p><p>The actress who's from the West Yorkshire market town where enduring BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed jokes: \"It's Holmfirth to Hollywood.\"</p><p>Pudsey and the Thread of Hope airs on 24 December at 10:20 GMT on BBC One and iPlayer, and on 27 December at 17:00 GMT on CBeebies and CBBC.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>For anyone who has spent years renting, staring at the same landlord-approved magnolia walls and dreaming of one day adding some actual personality to their home, Pantone's 2026 Colour of the Year might feel like a personal attack.</p><p>This year, Pantone has chosen white as its colour of the year.</p><p>More specifically, Cloud Dancer - a white described as \"lofty\" and \"billowy\" that \"serves as a symbol of calming influence in a society rediscovering the value of quiet reflection\".</p><p>It is the first time white has been chosen as the colour of the year, and it has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p>According to Pantone, Cloud Dancer \"is not just a colour, it's a mindset\" and reflects a collective desire to slow down, reset and find calm after years of visual overload.</p><p>But some critics have labelled the decision as \"Pantonedeaf\", arguing that elevating minimalist and pristine white spaces can feel far removed from the smaller, messier homes most people inhabit.</p><p>Others argue that positioning white as aspirational risks racial undertones, landing uncomfortably amid ongoing political and cultural conversations about race and representation.</p><p>Designer Chris Beaumont says the backlash goes beyond aesthetics, arguing that white carries cultural undertones and is rarely a neutral choice.</p><p>\"White is a signal,\" he says, shaped by a decade of minimalist celebrity interiors – most notably Kim Kardashian's stripped-back home – that came to represent \"wealth, order and distance from chaos\".</p><p>He explains that white is \"not about inspiration but being careful not to offend\", with Cloud Dancer embodying \"austerity, moral minimalism and the idea that neutrality signifies virtue\".</p><p>Beaumont points to the pandemic as a turning point in how people relate to their homes.</p><p>\"Overnight they became our offices, sanctuaries and emotional anchors,\" he says, adding that against this backdrop, pushing the Colour of the Year towards \"further visual emptiness feels rather tone-deaf\".</p><p>Rather than offering calm, he believes white now risks amplifying \"a sense of bleakness\", particularly when paired with cool, clinical lighting.</p><p>Lara Clarke, a Surrey based interior designer, agrees and says Cloud Dancer \"doesn't really read as a colour\" and is \"firmly in the bin for me\".</p><p>While it may suit highly minimal or architectural spaces, she says bright whites rarely create calm in real homes.</p><p>\"What looks serene in a styled shoot can easily feel clinical at home,\" she explains.</p><p>\"White can feel stark and unforgiving and you don't want your home to give hospital vibes.\"</p><p>She adds that \"homes should spark joy and feel warm and lived-in, and this shade feels quite removed from that.\"</p><p>Beaumont hopes that homeowners will reject the Pantone Colour of the Year in favour of \"full-scale dopamine décor\", using colour to express personality.</p><p>Laurie Pressman, VP of the Pantone Colour Institute, told the BBC that people \"bring different feelings\" to the meaning of the colour, but it was chosen as it \"works seamlessly with everything around it, offering a refined neutrality that feels intentional and adaptable\".</p><p>Since its launch in 2000, Pantone's Colour of the Year has become a powerful industry signal.</p><p>Past choices have included the optimism of Living Coral, the calm confidence of Classic Blue, the vibrancy of Viva Magenta, and most recently softer, emotionally driven tones like Peach Fuzz.</p><p>These colours don't just live on trend forecasts - they show up in fashion collections, beauty launches, interiors, packaging and even technology, shaping how products are marketed and how consumers imagine the year ahead.</p><p>Victoria Robinson, a style and trend expert, says Cloud Dancer is a \"beautiful choice\" and while it may seem simple, \"this particular shade feels soft and elegant rather than stark\".</p><p>In contrast to those who say the colour is boring, Robinson sees it as \"adaptable\" and says it's best used in \"bedrooms and living areas where you want a serene, restful atmosphere\".</p><p>\"Even if you don't want to repaint, you can introduce the colour into a room with cushions, throws and curtains.\"</p><p>Interior designer James Mellan-Matulewicz says although he was surprised that Pantone's pick this year was \"essentially the absence of colour\", it is a bit like vanilla ice cream, in that \"everyone likes it but it's nobody's favourite\".</p><p>He can see its merits, explaining that white can work particularly well as a backdrop for architectural details like panelling and arched doorways which is a \"growing trend in modern homes\".</p><p>In fashion, white has long been a staple rather than a statement and as a Colour of the Year it presents a different challenge to designers more accustomed to bold shades.</p><p>Luxury stylist Oriona Robb says elevating white feels \"less about novelty and more about intention\", reflecting a shift towards refinement after years of trend overloads.</p><p>\"White forces designers and wearers alike to focus on form, proportion and quality, there's really nowhere to hide,\" she explains.</p><p>But she adds that it also carries assumptions around body confidence, lifestyle and privilege, saying: \"When white is treated as something only a narrow group of people can pull off, it becomes exclusionary.\"</p><p>She says industry is already aware of the uncomfortable undertones tied to celebrating white as an ideal, particularly amid ongoing conversations about representation and accessibility, and the real test will be whether \"brands engage with that nuance honestly, or simply aestheticise the colour\".</p><p>Stylist Katie Malik admits the choice initially surprised her, given Pantone's history of bold colours, but says it reflects a genuine shift and fits within a wider mood of \"quiet luxury\", burnout and a rejection of excess.</p><p>She says feedback from her clients has been largely positive, with many craving calmer, more restorative spaces.</p><p>\"Many people are actively seeking tranquillity and serenity in their homes and aren't always ready to commit to more daring colours,\" she explains.</p><p>Whether white feels calming or sterile, Malik argues, depends on how it is used and far from being \"Pantonedeaf\", she sees it as one of Pantone's most usable picks.</p><p>Cloud Dancer is described as a blank canvas that allows \"all colours to shine\", a view Malik shares.</p><p>\"A blank canvas isn't an empty space, it's a space filled with potential,\" she says.</p><p>Adding that its success \"won't be in its universal adoption, but in how it anchors a larger conversation about what we want from our homes\".</p><p>For those tempted to embrace Cloud Dancer in all its pristine glory, one thing may be essential: a very good stain remover, kept firmly within reach.</p><p>Clare Lane says she had \"no idea\" she signed up to a subscription when she bought the items online.</p><p>Hailed as a visionary, the Yorkshireman will be remembered for his sculptured silhouettes and theatricality.</p><p>TV's suggestive \"Launderette\" Levi's advert was first shown 40 years ago, and sales went through the roof. The ad marked a turning point – and its influence continues today.</p><p>Karissa Hughes opened her first permanent shop after receiving a council grant.</p><p>Two friends came up with the idea of making clothes swapping exciting in an era of fast fashion.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Salt, fat, acid and heat are the essential elements of cooking to Samin Nosrat, who transformed them into her best-selling cookbook and popular Netflix series, “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.”</p><p>For her latest book, she has added to that list.</p><p>Before she mentions even a single recipe in “Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share With People You Love — A Cookbook,” Nosrat shares a spread of her “unexpectedly essential” kitchen gear, which includes one piece she used to dread but now adores: the immersion blender.</p><p>Nosrat’s culinary career began at Chez Panisse, where she worked her way up from food runner to cook over two years. Nosrat was often on soup duty at Alice Waters’ acclaimed Berkeley, California, bistro, which was a trailblazer in the farm-to-table movement.</p><p>“We’d use the immersion blender as the first step, then we’d have you transfer it into a smaller, normal-sized Vitamix blender, batch by batch, to get the smoothest, satin-iest texture,” Nosrat told CNN. “I had a vendetta against the immersion blender, because if I’m going to have to transfer it into the Vitamix countertop blender to puree it anyway, why bother? It took forever and felt like this huge burden to do this for 10-to-15-gallon pots of soup.”</p><p>Make this easy brunch recipe and invite your friends and family</p><p>At home, you’re making much less soup, Nosrat conceded, but those messy, fussy memories were hard for her to erase. For years, every time she saw an immersion blender, she would have a visceral reaction. “I had this dread in my stomach,” she said. “The idea of blending a soup was restaurant-sized dread, even when it was applied to a home-sized meal.”</p><p>All of that changed when Nosrat realized she could skip a step. Frustrated after one too many countertop blender mishaps spilling on her clothes or spraying the contents onto the ceiling, Nosrat decided to stick with the stick blender while developing a recipe for butternut squash and green curry soup.</p><p>“I’m just at home and not trying to serve this to people in fine dining circumstances, so I figured it might be fine. It was, and that single recipe changed everything,” Nosrat said.</p><p>In fact, the immersion blender breakthrough was so impactful that Nosrat decided to pay tribute to that creation with the Curried Carrot and Coconut Soup that stars in her latest cookbook (recipe below).</p><p>“Once I realized that creamy soup does just fine with the immersion blender only, it felt like a liberation,” she added.</p><p>35 million tons of food go to waste yearly in the US. Experts share tips to help stop it</p><p>As soon as the handheld blender was back in her good graces, Nosrat discovered two more stellar uses: for whipping up quick mayos and salad dressings.</p><p>“I have grown to love using it for making a small amount of an emulsion,” she said, referring to the process of mixing two liquids that normally don’t like to combine.</p><p>Want to try it out? Round up a small mason jar, add an egg, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1 cup of a neutral-flavored oil, and blitz. In less than a minute, you have mayonnaise.</p><p>“If I were doing it by hand, I’d have to invest a ton of time and energy to whisk it,” Nosrat said. “Using a narrow jar and the immersion blender, it comes together quickly and easily since the blade is small and the ingredients are much closer together and more compressed than they would be in a large bowl.”</p><p>The same secret comes in clutch for salad dressings such as a Caesar or the creamy oregano dressing in “Good Things.” Besides being quick and easy to emulsify, “the idea that I can make the dressing in the same jar that I store it in has been a revelation for me,” she added. Just add a lid and pop any extra in the refrigerator for tomorrow.</p><p>You should make your own salad dressing</p><p>As far as what brand to buy, Nosrat said she has relied on a Vitamix Immersion Blender for five years, “and it’s just so powerful.” That said, feel free to invest in whatever model fits your budget, she said. While powerful tools can simplify certain tasks, the most important part is making any adjustments required so it’s easier to step inside the kitchen and create something nourishing.</p><p>“‘Good Things’ is about the gratification of getting to use your hands and creating something in a world that is committed to separating us from the act of making something,” Nosrat said. “There are so many forces that digitize and take away the opportunity to be part of the creation process from start to finish. I do think there’s something so essential in that. Cooking gives us an opportunity to do this any day.”</p><p>Don’t let the lengthy ingredient list scare you away from making this cozy meal, which is inspired by Nosrat’s butternut squash soup revelation and spicy, punchy Thai red curries. The garnish is optional but highly recommended and described as a “real standout” by Nosrat. The crunchy, savory sprinkle is a twist on a popular snack across Thailand and Laos called miang kham.</p><p>As for the soup, the only secret is to leave a bit of breathing room at the top of the pot.</p><p>For this or any creamy soup, “you want to put an immersion blender in a pot that’s not super full, because the blender will incorporate air into the base of the pot as it’s blending. That will increase the volume of the soup,” Nosrat advised.</p><p>The best immersion blenders in 2025, tested by editors (Courtesy CNN Underscored)</p><p>Reach for a large enough vessel so the volume of the soup fills it no more than two-thirds of the way to the top and insert the immersion blender at a slight angle so it doesn’t create a vacuum seal on the bottom — and so that the soup and fiber can swim around the pot.</p><p>Makes about 2 quarts</p><p>Serves 4</p><p>Total cooking time: About 50 minutes</p><p>For the soup:</p><p>●   ¼ cup coconut oil</p><p>●   3 shallots, diced</p><p>●   One 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</p><p>●   1 lemongrass stalk, cut into 3-inch pieces</p><p>●   Kosher salt</p><p>● 3 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced ½ -inch thick</p><p>●   Two 13.5-ounce cans coconut milk</p><p>●   6 to 8 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, or to taste</p><p>●   3 tablespoons fish sauce</p><p>●   3 to 4 cups chicken stock or water</p><p>For the garnish:</p><p>●   ¾ cup salted, dry-roasted peanuts</p><p>●   ¾ cup unsweetened coconut flakes</p><p>●   2 tablespoons fish sauce</p><p>●   8 small dried red chilies, such as chiles de árbol, thinly sliced</p><p>●   1 tablespoon coconut oil, melted</p><p>●   1 tablespoon minced lemongrass</p><p>●   1 tablespoon sugar</p><p>●   10 makrut lime leaves, thinly sliced (optional)</p><p>●   Handful of Thai basil leaves</p><p>●   2 to 3 limes, quartered</p><p>1. Adjust an oven rack to the center position and preheat to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>2. To make the soup, melt the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the shallots, ginger, pieces of lemongrass and a generous pinch of salt. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots are tender and just starting to brown, about 18 minutes.</p><p>3. Increase the heat to high and add the carrots, coconut milk, curry paste, fish sauce and 3 cups of the stock. As the soup comes to a boil, partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to keep the liquid at a gentle simmer. Cook the soup until the carrots are completely tender, about 25 minutes.</p><p>4. Meanwhile, to make the garnish, in a medium bowl, combine the peanuts, coconut flakes, fish sauce, chiles, oil, lemongrass, sugar and lime leaves (if using). Spread the mixture out on a sheet pan in a single layer. Bake until the coconut is a deep golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes after the first 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and pour the mixture immediately into a bowl to prevent overcooking. Stir to combine and set aside.</p><p>5. Remove the soup from the heat and discard the lemongrass. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup. (Alternatively, transfer soup in batches to a blender or food processor and puree.) Taste and adjust for salt and curry paste. Add more stock or water to thin soup to the desired consistency.</p><p>6. Thinly slice the Thai basil leaves and arrange on a small plate or platter, along with lime wedges and the peanut mixture. Serve the soup hot with garnishes.</p><p>Karla Walsh is a Des Moines, Iowa-based freelance lifestyle writer with more than 16 years of editorial experience.</p><p>Recipe adapted from “Good Things” by Samin Nosrat.

{"details":"<p>Rising temperatures in the UK will become \"the new normal\", a leading government climate adviser has warned, as she called for more to be done to prepare for the impacts of climate change.</p><p>It comes as the Met Office revealed 2025 was on course to be the UK's hottest year since records began, with climate change continuing to drive higher temperatures.</p><p>With just over a week still to go, the average UK air temperature across 2025 is on track to end up at about 10.05C, which would edge out the current record of 10.03C from 2022.</p><p>\"This is our future, encapsulated in data,\" Professor Rachel Kyte told the BBC.</p><p>\"Now the question is 'how are we going to prepare ourselves and build our resilience to this?'\"</p><p>A lack of rainfall and persistent warmth left the country vulnerable to droughts and wildfires through the spring and summer.</p><p>While temperatures vary naturally from year to year, scientists could not be clearer that human-caused climate change is driving the UK's rapidly warming trend.</p><p>\"The pollution [carbon dioxide] we've put in for the last 20-30 years is now what is driving this warmth, and so not curbing emissions well enough means we're going to continue to see these kinds of impacts,\" Prof Kyte, the UK's special representative for climate, said.</p><p>She said the UK needed to become \"resilient\" to the inevitability of higher temperatures through further investment in nature and infrastructure.</p><p>\"If we don't invest in our adaptation now, it's going to cost us way more,\" she warned.</p><p>By the end of 2025, the UK's 10 warmest years on record will all have taken place in the last two decades, in measurements going back to the late 1800s.</p><p>\"Anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change is causing the warming in the UK as it's causing the warming across the world,\" said Amy Doherty, a climate scientist at the Met Office.</p><p>\"What we have seen in the past 40 years, and what we're going to continue to see, is more records broken, more extremely hot years [...] so what was normal 10 years ago, 20 years ago, will become [relatively] cool in the future,\" she told BBC News.</p><p>The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year are 2C below the long-term December average, with slightly cooler conditions expected over Christmas.</p><p>So while the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, it is the most likely outcome.</p><p>It would be the sixth time this century that the UK has set a new annual temperature record, following 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014 and 2022.</p><p>\"The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th Century,\" said Mike Kendon, another climate scientist at the Met Office.</p><p>The expected new record of 2025 has been built on persistent heat through the spring and summer.</p><p>Those long, hot, sunny days may feel like a distant memory as we head towards Christmas, but both spring and summer were the UK's warmest ever recorded.</p><p>Each month from March to August was more than 2C above the long-term average between 1961 and 1990.</p><p>Temperatures peaked at 35.8C - well below the highs of more than 40C seen in July 2022 - but hot spells happened repeatedly.</p><p>Four separate - albeit relatively short-lived - heatwaves were declared across much of the country.</p><p>The UK Health Security Agency also issued several heat-health alerts through the summer.</p><p>Mr Kendon said longer spells of hotter days and nights posed an increased risk to elderly and vulnerable people.</p><p>He told the Today programme it would also have an impact on the agriculture sector, influencing which crops farmers are able to grow in the UK.</p><p>Spring and summer were also marked by low rainfall. Spring was particularly dry - the UK's sixth driest since 1836.</p><p>Combined with the warm weather helping to dry out the soils, this lack of rainfall pushed large parts of the country towards drought.</p><p>Through the summer, official droughts were declared across several regions in England and Wales, by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales respectively.</p><p>Parts of eastern Scotland also entered \"significant water scarcity\", according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p><p>Recent rainfall has eased the situation across much of the country and most areas are no longer in official drought. But water levels are still below average in some places.</p><p>\"There's a huge deficit to be made up, and there's a huge implication, not just for people who are farming the land [and] growing food, but our rivers, our aquifers, our availability of drinking water,\" said Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.</p><p>The repeated swings between drought and flooding were making it very hard for communities to adapt to increasing weather extremes, she added.</p><p>The prolonged dry, warm weather created ideal conditions for wildfires too.</p><p>By late April, the area of the UK burned by wildfires had already reached a new annual record, according to data from the Global Wildfires Information System going back to 2012.</p><p>More than 47,100 hectares (471 sq km or 182 sq miles) has now been burned throughout 2025 - smashing the previous high of 28,100 hectares of 2019.</p><p>Andy Cole, chief fire officer at Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters in his region had responded to more than 1,000 wildfires this year - an \"unprecedented\" number, he said.</p><p>\"I've been doing this for over 20 years and we've seen a marked increase in the number of fires we're having to deal with in the open,\" he told the Today programme.</p><p>As the UK continues to heat up - driven by humanity's greenhouse gas emissions - scientists expect the UK to experience more weather extremes.</p><p>\"The conditions that people are going to experience are going to continue to change as they have in the last few years [with] more wildfires, more droughts, more heatwaves,\" said Dr Doherty.</p><p>\"But also it's going to get wetter in the winter half-year, so from October to March [...] the rain that does fall will fall more intensely, and in heavier rain showers, causing that kind of flooding that we've been seeing this year as well,\" she added.</p><p>The UK has not been alone in experiencing extreme heat this year. The world is on course for its second or third warmest year ever recorded, according to the European Copernicus climate service.</p><p>But the international consensus on tackling climate change is also being tested, with the US and some other leading producers of fossil fuels rowing back on their net zero commitments.</p><p>Additional reporting by Justin Rowlatt, Kate Stephens and Zahra Fatima</p><p>Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

{"details":"<p>As millions of Americans hit the road or take to the skies for the holidays, another seasonal traveler is picking up speed: influenza.</p><p>Flu activity is already rising across the country. In the week ending December 13, roughly 4% of visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses, and nearly 10,000 patients were hospitalized with influenza, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released Friday. So far, three children already have died from flu-related causes this flu season.</p><p>Those numbers mean the virus may be closer to home than many families realize. Holiday gatherings could include someone just recovering from the flu, or someone beginning to feel sick. Should they still show up to open presents on Christmas morning? How long should a visit be postponed before heading to grandma’s to bake cookies?</p><p>As flu cases climb, here are the flu-related rules families should know this holiday season.</p><p>Flu is spreading ahead of holiday gatherings</p><p>There are several over-the-counter flu tests available in the United States, and they can be taken at home as a nasal swab, similar to Covid-19 tests.</p><p>Many doctors recommend taking a test as soon as you experience symptoms.</p><p>“Particularly if you’re a person in a high-risk group,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p><p>“Those persons are people who are age 65 and older, anyone who has a chronic underlying medical condition, if you’re immune compromised, if you’re a pregnant person and very young children,” he said. “Those are all people who are in high-risk, and once they have symptoms, that’s the time to get tested, because we would have antivirals available to help keep you out of the hospital.”</p><p>Flu symptoms usually start suddenly with fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, Dr. Pamela Lindor, a pediatrician at Bluebird Kids Health in Jacksonville, Florida, said in an email.</p><p>While you should quickly start treatment and avoid exposing others when you test positive for flu, “if the over the counter test is negative but your symptoms are severe, consider getting a more accurate test from your doctor or urgent care center,” she said.</p><p>Testing is key because once it is determined which respiratory illness you have, you can then receive appropriate treatment, Schaffner said.</p><p>“Flu is not the only illness we’re concerned about. Maybe you have Covid, and if you have Covid, we have another medication that could help keep you out of the hospital,” he said.</p><p>Flu variant driving up cases across the US</p><p>Flu antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu or Xofluza, are prescription medications, and they work best when started early, ideally within two days after flu symptoms begin.</p><p>“For the flu, if you are ill, the sooner you begin the antiviral, the more effective it is,” Schaffner said. “There is the 48-hour rule. That is, for it to be maximally effective, you have to initiate treatment within the first 48 hours after you get symptoms. But even after 48 hours – and this is especially true for high-risk people – you can still have some modulating effect of the antivirals.”</p><p>As soon as someone starts to show symptoms, they should stay home and avoid contact with other people to not spread the virus.</p><p>“You’re capable of transmitting the influenza virus the day before you get symptoms,” Schaffner said. “But nonetheless, wear a mask and avoid other people in your family as much as possible until your symptoms start to abate and you’ve had no fever for 24 hours without using Tylenol.”</p><p>According to the CDC, people can return to their normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, they have not had a fever without using fever-reduction medication, and their overall symptoms are improving.</p><p>“This will usually be at least 4-5 days,” Lindor said. “Flu is most contagious starting the day before symptoms develop and continuing for about one week.”</p><p>Some people who have symptoms or fever might be tempted to still visit family or open Christmas gifts with loved ones, as long as they wear a mask, but Schaffner still warned against it.</p><p>“If you’ve developed symptoms, I think you’ve got to stay home,” Schaffner said.</p><p>“Even if you say, ‘Well, I have these symptoms, but I’ll wear a mask.’ Yes, that will reduce the chance of spreading but not reduce it to zero. And guess what? It’s very hard to eat and drink with a mask on,” he said. “So, you will indeed be exposing people. And when you get to family members, even when you wear that mask, they’ll be hugging and kissing. These are very close circumstances, so you’ve got to restrain yourself and separate yourself, otherwise you are very much in danger of becoming a dreaded spreader.”</p><p>While someone with flu should take precautions to isolate themselves and not expose others, there are important steps their household members also can take to reduce their risk of getting sick.</p><p>“Good handwashing is very important to prevent spread,” Lindor said. “Common surfaces in the house should be disinfected.”</p><p>How to cut your chances of getting sick from respiratory viruses this winter</p><p>Some doctors may prescribe antiviral medications to people who have been exposed to someone with flu, but they are not yet showing signs or symptoms themselves, especially if that person is in a high-risk group.</p><p>“Tamiflu can be prescribed to people who have been exposed to the flu, and is usually taken for 7-10 days to prevent infection,” Lindor said. “Xofluza can also be used prophylactically, and only one dose is needed, for adults and children 5 or older.”</p><p>For example, a 22-year-old college student may travel home for Christmas to visit their grandfather. The next day, after they have already visited their grandfather, they test positive for the flu.</p><p>“Their grandfather is obviously in a high-risk group. Should the grandfather take Tamiflu for five days? That’s not a bad idea,” Schaffner said. “In that circumstance, it could very well avert the influenza infection.”</p><p>It’s important to stay in contact with your doctor once you test positive for flu and experience worsening symptoms, especially if you are in a high-risk group, Schaffner said.</p><p>And with your doctor, “have those discussions about when it is that you need to go to the hospital,” he said. “But difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, really feeling terrible, temperatures of 103 or higher – all of those things are indicators that you really need medical attention.”</p><p>Some other “warning signs” that may require urgent medical attention include “dehydration, chest pain, lethargy, mental status changes, seizures or severe weakness,” Lindor said. “Confusion, behavior changes, or high persistent fever for over 3 days also warrant urgent medical attention.”</p><p>There is still time to receive your seasonal flu shot if you haven’t already.</p><p>“For all those people out there who are still well, if you haven’t been vaccinated, please get the vaccine. Don’t linger,” Schaffner said.</p><p>“That’s a holiday present to you and to everyone else around you,” he said. “There’s more than one kind of influenza virus out there, and the vaccine helps prevent serious disease due to three different types of influenza virus.”</p><p>Lindor said that overall, the best way to avoid having the flu disrupt family gatherings during the holidays is “for all family members to get their flu vaccine early in the flu season each year.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a daily pill version of Novo Nordisk’s weight-loss drug Wegovy, introducing a new option for how patients can take medicines in a class of drugs that has revolutionized obesity treatment.</p><p>The drug, which Novo Nordisk calls simply the Wegovy pill, uses the same active ingredient – semaglutide – that powers the original Wegovy, along with its sister drug for diabetes, Ozempic.</p><p>Both Wegovy and Ozempic, which mimic the hormone GLP-1, are given as weekly injections, as are rival drugs from Eli Lilly, called Zepbound and Mounjaro. Altogether, about 1 in 8 US adults say they’re currently taking one of the medicines, according to data from health policy research group KFF.</p><p>The Wegovy pill showed roughly similar weight loss and side effects in clinical trials as the Wegovy shot, and will be available by prescription in the US in January, according to Novo Nordisk.</p><p>“We believe it will expand access and options for patients,” Dr. Jason Brett, principal US medical head for Novo Nordisk, told CNN in an interview. “We know there are some patients who just won’t take an injectable medication.”</p><p>The starting dose of the Wegovy pill will cost $149 for patients paying out of pocket, under an agreement announced in November with the Trump administration. The drug will likely become pricier via self-pay as doses increase, though Novo Nordisk hasn’t disclosed those prices yet. Patients whose insurance covers the medicine will likely have a lower copay.</p><p>The Wegovy pill is one of two oral GLP-1 drugs expected to hit the market in the next few months; the other, from Lilly, is called orforglipron – until it receives a brand name – and is expected to be cleared by the FDA by summer.</p><p>The pills haven’t been compared head-to-head in a clinical trial, but in separate studies, the Wegovy pill showed average weight loss of 14% over 64 weeks, compared with 2% for a placebo, while orforglipron showed 11% weight loss over 72 weeks on its highest dose, compared with 2% for the placebo group. Wegovy injection showed weight loss of 15% in its key trial, versus 2% for placebo, while Zepbound showed 21% on its highest dose, compared with 3% for those on placebo.</p><p>Gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting are the most commonly experienced side effects with GLP-1 drugs, which was seen in studies of the pills as well. Overall, 7% of participants in the Wegovy pill trial stopped treatment because of side effects, versus 6% on placebo. In orforglipron’s study, up to 10% of patients stopped treatment, compared with 3% on placebo.</p><p>One difference between the medicines is that the Wegovy pill must be taken on an empty stomach with a small amount of water, and patients are directed not to eat, drink or take other medicines for 30 minutes after taking it. A pill version of semaglutide approved for diabetes, called Rybelsus, hasn’t been used as widely as Ozempic in part for that reason, doctors say.</p><p>Lilly touts that, in clinical trials, orforglipron was taken once a day at any time, without restrictions on food or water.</p><p>That convenience factor may tip scales in favor of Lilly’s pill, if and when it’s approved, said Evan Seigerman, a financial analyst who follows both companies closely for Wall Street firm BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>He anticipates that doctors and patients may especially turn to pills for weight maintenance, after reaching a weight-loss plateau on injectable drugs. Lilly showed in recently announced clinical trial results that patients who switched to orforglipron after losing weight on either Wegovy or Zepbound regained less weight than participants who switched to a placebo.</p><p>To Dr. Judith Korner, an endocrinologist and director of the Metabolic and Weight Control Center at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, there are three major considerations for assessing whether new medicines are right for her patients: how well they work, how safe and tolerable they are to take, and how much they cost.</p><p>“The Wegovy pill doesn’t seem to be moving the needle that much with regard to any of the above,” Korner told CNN.</p><p>While the price of $149 for the starting dose is lower than what the companies currently offer for the injectable drugs, that price is only for the initial, lowest dose. These medicines are designed to start at a low dose and have patients gradually ramp up over time, to manage side effects; the Wegovy pill will come in doses of 1.5 milligrams, 4 milligrams, 9 milligrams and the expected longer-term dose of 25 milligrams, Brett said.</p><p>“The lowest dose is almost never the dose that people wind up being on,” said Korner. “That’s just sort of like a loading dose, to let your body get used to it.”</p><p>Lilly, which will also offer the $149 starting price under the Trump agreement, says additional doses of orforglipron will cost up to $399 if patients are paying cash.</p><p>Korner does applaud having more options for patients in a group of medicines that’s proven to be beneficial beyond weight loss.</p><p>“As we start seeing these benefits, like for people who’ve had cardiac disease, 20% reduction in death or another event; reduction in sleep apnea; reduction in heart failure; improved liver function,” Korner said, “that’s, to me, the exciting part.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A wildlife charity has declared 2025 \"the Year of the Blooming Octopus\" after record numbers were spotted off the south-west coast of England.</p><p>In its annual marine review the Wildlife Trusts says octopus numbers were this summer at their highest level since 1950.</p><p>Warmer winters, which are linked to climate change, are thought to be responsible for the population spike, which is known as a \"bloom\".</p><p>The charity's findings are backed up by official figures which show that more than 1,200 tonnes of octopus was caught by fishermen in UK waters in the summer of 2025.</p><p>It's a dramatic increase on previous years. Only once since 2021 has more than 200 tonnes of octopus been landed.</p><p>Experts say most of those spotted are Octopus vulgaris a species commonly seen in the warmer Mediterranean Sea. Wildlife Trusts volunteers in Cornwall and Devon reported an increase in sightings of more than 1,500 percent on 2023 figures along one stretch of the south coast.</p><p>\"It really has been exceptional,\" says Matt Slater from the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. \"We've seen octopuses jet-propelling themselves along. We've seen octopuses camouflaging themselves, they look just like seaweeds.</p><p>\"We've seen them cleaning themselves. And we've even seen them walking, using two legs just to nonchalantly cruise away from the diver underwater.\"</p><p>It's unclear at this point whether the rise in numbers is permanent or cyclical,  which would mean octopus numbers returning to more typical levels after this year's bloom.</p><p>The eight-armed cephalopods eat shellfish such as lobster, crabs and scallops so the Wildlife Trusts warn that if population numbers remain high, both fishing and eating habits may have to change.</p><p>\"They are having an impact on those (shellfish) species around our shores. And as a consequence, they will be having an impact on our fishing industry who target those species as well,\" Ruth Williams the head of marine for The Wildlife Trusts told the BBC's Today programmme.</p><p>\"But there are opportunities and our fishing industry are doing some research into that at the moment to try and evolve with the changing fisheries that we're seeing as a result of climate change.\"</p><p>Government data shows crab landings down on previous years but catches of lobster, crawfish and scallops stable.</p><p>Alongside good news for octopus lovers, the Wildlife Trusts' marine review contains more sobering news.</p><p>The Trusts say this year was bookended by environmental disasters, with a collision between an oil tanker and a container ship in the North Sea in March spilling huge quantities of plastic resin pellets, and nearly 4.5 tonnes of bio-beads released from a water treatment plant in Sussex in November.</p><p>There was some better news for wildlife elsewhere, with a record 46,000 puffins recorded on Skomer, Pembrokeshire, while the charismatic black and white bird has made a comeback on the Isle of Muck following conservation efforts by Ulster Wildlife Trust to remove invasive brown rats.</p><p></p><p>2025 is set to be the fourth-hottest year in Oxford despite potentially record high UK-wide temperatures.</p><p>The Met Office says that 2025 is likely to be the UK's hottest year since records began.</p><p>From acrobatic gorillas to maritime lions and fluorescent plants, here are the most eye-catching shots of the natural world from 2025.</p><p>Rescuers hope the pup is thriving after being seen nibbling fishing ropes in Northumberland.</p><p>The Environment Agency says it is investigating at three sites over suspected illegal waste tipping.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new class of battleships bearing his name puts a fresh spotlight on a US naval shipbuilding program that has fallen short on delivering the new warships on time and on budget in recent years, something Trump himself pointed out in his speech from Mar-a-Lago on Monday.</p><p>“We make the greatest equipment in the world, by far, nobody’s even close. But we don’t produce them fast enough,” Trump said, as he announced he would meet soon with top US military contractors to ramp up production for the new battleships and other weapons programs.</p><p>But at least in the battleship plan, the Navy would seem to be swimming upstream, with construction of the vessels themselves and some of the weapon systems the service says would be aboard.</p><p>Here’s what to consider about the proposed “Trump-class” battleships:</p><p>A US Navy fact sheet released Monday says the Trump class will be “the most lethal warship to ever be built.”</p><p>With a length of up to 880 feet and a displacement of 30,000 to 40,000 tons, they’ll also be the biggest surface combatants the US Navy has constructed since World War II.</p><p>Those battleships, like the renowned USS Missouri, which hosted the Japanese surrender in 1945, were 887 feet long and displaced around 58,000 tons.</p><p>The biggest surface combatants in the US Navy fleet now are the Zumwalt destroyers, which displace 15,000 tons.</p><p>As envisioned, the ships will have “the most destructive fire power of any surface ship to ever sail – having the ability to strike an adversary at 80x the range of the previous class,” the Navy’s new website on the ships says.</p><p>The battleships will be armed with new nuclear-capable cruise missiles to be launched from 12 cells on board. The missiles would be hypersonic – more than five times the speed of sound – and maneuverable to confuse enemy defenses.</p><p>The Trump class would also feature 128 vertical launch cells that can be used for slower-flying Tomahawk cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, or missile defense interceptors.</p><p>Other armaments would include a rail gun, five-inch conventional guns, and a range of lasers and smaller guns.</p><p>Overall the planned ships would be 100 times more powerful than those World War II-era battleships, Trump said.</p><p>The administration has given no timeframe for how long it will take for the design phase – which the president said he will personally be involved in – or the building of the first two ships.</p><p>The new battleships project would be led by a naval shipbuilding base that has struggled to deliver in recent years and which Navy Secretary John Phelan said this year was in disarray.</p><p>“All of our programs are a mess,” he told a US House hearing in June. “I think our best (ship build) is six months late and 57% over budget … That is the best one.”</p><p>Then last month Phelan axed the Constellation-class frigate program, which was about three years behind schedule and was expected to yield much smaller and less complex warships than the new battleships Trump now proposes.</p><p>As far as large complex ships go, the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, the USS John F Kennedy, has slipped about two years behind its scheduled delivery date, which was July of this year. Those delays have been attributed to new landing and weapons elevator systems which the service is still trying to get certified.</p><p>Then there’s the question of who will build these new battleships. US shipyards are already stretched thin with current construction, maintenance and overhaul jobs.</p><p>“We no longer have the shipbuilding and maritime industrial infrastructure to do this quickly,” said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.</p><p>Ships the size of the Trump-class would need the same dockyard space as large amphibious and logistical support ships the Navy also needs, so closed shipyards would need to be reactivated or new ones built, Schuster said.</p><p>And then there’s the workforce.</p><p>“A national scale recruitment and training program for shipyard, electrical, information and sensor system workers (would be) required to support this program,” Schuster said.</p><p>Can South Korean shipyards help ‘Make American Shipbuilding Great Again’?</p><p>Navy Secretary Phelan just recently pointed out the difficulties in recruiting a workforce, especially when it comes to pay.</p><p>If workers can make the same money working in an Amazon warehouse or a convenience store, they’re less likely to choose the he arduous, backbreaking jobs found in a naval shipyard, he told a defense conference in Indiana last month.</p><p>Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College London, said Washington has the technical know-how to make these ships, but it must overcome the shipyard problem.</p><p>“The question is … whether the US has a sufficient shipyard capacity and workforce to translate a visual gold fleet into a real sailing one,” he said.</p><p>Lastly, cost has to be a consideration.</p><p>Trump said Monday the new battleships ships would eventually replace the Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the backbone of the US surface fleet.</p><p>Those destroyers cost about $2 billion each. A Trump-class ship would have a price tag as high as $15 billion, according to a Monday report from USNI News.</p><p>Schuster noted the Navy’s sketchy record on seeing ambitious shipbuilding programs followed through to completion.</p><p>Take the aforementioned Zumwalt-class destroyers, a program that began in the 1990s. A plan for 32 of the high-tech, stealthy ships, was eventually cut to three, with the last of the class, the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, still awaiting commissioning –– now not expected until 2027.</p><p>Or the Constellation-class frigates, which were cut to a maximum two hulls from a planned 20.</p><p>And, as Schuster points out, recent shipbuilding programs that have reached plan numbers have fallen well short of overall success, specifically the Littoral Combat Ships. That program, which has produced more than three dozen hulls, has seen some of them retired with as little as five years of service as they’ve been plagued by reliability issues and a lack of a well-defined mission.</p><p>US Navy chief defends plan to scrap troubled warships even though some are less than 3 years old</p><p>At least one of the weapons planned for the Trump class – the rail gun – will need to be rescued from the scrap heap if it’s to be used on the battleships.  The Navy cancelled its rail gun program in 2021, when technical challenges proved too difficult to overcome.</p><p>Rail gun tech uses electromagnetic power to propel a hardened projectile at speeds far higher than current weapon systems - but it requires huge amounts of power and most programs around the world have made little progress so far towards a commercially viable, reliable weapon.</p><p>Schuster says the Trump administration also needs to make some changes in management if it wants the Trump class to be successful.</p><p>“This project will be managed by NAVSEA (Naval Sea Systems Command), an organization and staff that has screwed up every surface warship program of this century,” he said.</p><p>“I believe Trump must clean house in that organization if he wants any shipbuilding program to succeed.”</p><p>Patalano says there’s a further problem within the Navy: crewing the new larger vessels, which the service expected to have 650 to 850 sailors aboard.</p><p>“The US Navy is not known for being at the forefront of automation and innovative solutions in terms of more compact crew management.”</p><p>Doing so “will require a cultural shift – in light of other new classes being built – of no trifling proportions,” Patalano said.</p><p>Should the Navy be able to get a fleet of Trump-class battleships into the water, there’s still a question of whether they’ll be suitable for the missions at hand.</p><p>That’s a question being posed of the current jewels of the US fleet – its aircraft carriers. Can the massive ships – about 1,100 feet long, the length of three football fields – survive a conflict with a peer adversary like China?</p><p>The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) boasts the DF-26 intermediate range ballistic missile, nicknamed the “carrier killer” because it was designed to take out the US flattops at distances far from the Chinese mainland well before the US carriers’ fighter jets could engage Chinese targets.</p><p>Some analysts say Washington should be focusing on large numbers of small naval vessels, capable of carrying a few missiles or drones each, and dispersing them across a vast range of waterways, negating Beijing’s advantage in missile numbers by presenting too many targets to handle.</p><p>A 2023 Defense Department factsheet notes how Washington is making its forces in the Pacific “more mobile, distributed, resilient, and lethal” to deter adversaries and reassure allies.</p><p>Like the carriers, large battleships could be putting too much firepower on one platform, critics say.</p><p>“The advantages of small battleships and unmanned systems are that the quantity can be increased at a relatively low cost and viability can be increased by dispersing risk across multiple platforms,” said Yu Jihoon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses and former South Korean submarine officer.</p><p>And large ships aren’t only vulnerable to missiles, some say. There’s also a question of how they can deal with drones, cheap unmanned platforms in the air and on and below the sea, that Ukraine has shown during its war with Russia can at least disable if not sink surface ships and submarines alike.</p><p>China displayed an array of undersea naval drones at a military parade in Beijing in September, watched by leader Xi Jinping, who was flanked by Russian leader Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Writing on the website Naval News this month, analyst H I Sutton said large Chinese drones could be used to lay mines that could choke off US naval ports around the Pacific. If the proposed US battleships can’t get to sea, they’re not going to be able to bring their offensive firepower into play.</p><p>In a first, Ukraine says it struck Russian submarine in Black Sea port with underwater drones</p><p>That’s a long list of challenges to the proposed Trump-class battleship program, but analysts say Washington should not be counted out.</p><p>After all, as Trump said in his speech on Monday, this is the country that ramped up military production enough during World War II to turn out multiple ships in a single day.</p><p>Schuster sees a more recent example, from the 1960s.</p><p>“I think Trump is trying to achieve a maritime equivalent to JFK’s call for a space program. Remember, the Soviets seemed to be ahead of us in space, a direct threat to our national security” before Washington launched the Apollo program that saw an American walk on the moon on July 20, 1969.</p><p>But Schuster doesn’t think the US can do it alone this time. Allies are needed, something difficult to manage when it comes to the laws governing current US naval shipbuilding.</p><p>US Navy shipbuilding is ‘a mess.’ South Korean companies think they can help fix it</p><p>“The PLAN (China’s navy) is nearing the ability to challenge our access to the Western Pacific, a direct and clear threat to our national security. Since it also poses a threat to Japan and South Korea, enlisting their help to meet that challenge is a necessary solution to the problem,” Schuster said.</p><p>That allied cooperation is in early stages, but seeds have been planted. Trump on Monday praised South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, which is investing billions into the Philly Shipyard, which could be building future US Navy ships.</p><p>CNN’s Gawon Bae contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The Trump administration will begin garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in default starting in January, the Education Department told CNN on Tuesday.</p><p>“We expect the first notices to be sent to approximately 1,000 defaulted borrowers the week of January 7, and the notices will increase in scale on a month-to-month basis,” the department said in a statement.</p><p>The move comes months after the administration restarted collecting federal student loans in default, which happens after 270 days without payment. The process, known as administrative wage garnishment, allows the agency to order non-federal employers to withhold part of an employee’s income to pay off the student loans.</p><p>If the department scales up its wage garnishment efforts, millions could be affected. The department said in April that more than 5 million borrowers were in default and nearly 4 million more were delinquent, which means they hadn’t made a payment in more than 90 days.</p><p>Earlier this year, the government also resumed the Treasury Offset Program, which collects defaulted debts by garnishing federal and state payments, such as tax returns or Social Security benefits.</p><p>Critics have insisted that beginning wage garnishment will add stress to borrowers struggling with higher costs.</p><p>What the restart of defaulted student loan collection means for borrowers</p><p>“As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers’ wages instead of defending borrowers’ right to affordable payments,” Protect Borrowers Deputy Executive Director Persis Yu said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>Student loan borrowers stand to face even more changes in the coming months. President Donald Trump’s landmark tax and spending cuts package – the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – passed earlier this year, placed new caps on the amount students can borrow in federal student loans for graduate school and how much parents can borrow to help pay students’ tuition. It also eliminated certain deferments on student loans and created a much more limited set of repayment options.</p><p>Trump administration announces deal to end Biden-era student debt repayment plan</p><p>And earlier this month, the Trump administration announced an agreement to end the SAVE plan, a Biden-era repayment plan that has faced legal challenges for years, affecting nearly 8 million borrowers. If approved in federal court, borrowers will have a “limited time” – the amount not yet outlined – to enroll in a new plan.</p><p>Borrowers in default can no longer receive deferment or forbearance, which allow borrowers to temporarily stop making payments on loans, according to the Department of Education’s website. They will also no longer have the ability to choose a repayment plan. The department has urged borrowers to contact the student aid office’s Default Resolution Group.</p><p>For borrowers who are facing severe financial stress, it’s possible to discharge loans in bankruptcy if they meet certain criteria.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka became the first player to defect from LIV Golf, a significant blow to the Saudi-funded league that raises questions whether the PGA Tour will find a way for him to return.</p><p>LIV Golf posted an announcement to its website under a statement that Talor Gooch is the new captain of the Smash team that Koepka had led.</p><p>Scott O’Neil, the new CEO of LIV, said Koepka and LIV “amicably and mutually agreed” that Koepka will no longer compete in the league.</p><p>“Brooks is prioritizing the needs of his family and staying closer to home,” O’Neil said. “We appreciate the significant impact he has had on the game and wish him continued success, both on and off the course.”</p><p>Thank you, @BKoepka pic.twitter.com/Z4brvVd76e</p><p>LIV does not disclose contracts, though it was believed Koepka had another year left from when he joined in June 2022.</p><p>The PGA Tour policy banning players who have joined the rival league requires them to sit out for one year from their last participation. LIV ended its season on Aug. 24.</p><p>Koepka began his career on the European tour and would have access to play there. He played four European tour events this year, finishing fourth in the French Open a week before the Ryder Cup. He played in the 2023 Ryder Cup, but was not a consideration this year because of his form.</p><p>Blake Smith, Koepka’s manager at Hambric Sports, said there would be no comment beyond a statement released through LIV Golf that Koepka is grateful for his time at LIV.</p><p>“Family has always guided Brooks’s decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend more time at home,” the statement said. “Brooks will continue to be a huge supporter of LIV Golf and wishes the league and its players continued success. Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will keep fans updated on what’s ahead.”</p><p>The PGA Tour, while not offering any substance, took the rare step of acknowledging the move involving a player who is no longer a member.</p><p>“Brooks Koepka is a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success,” the tour said in a statement. “The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.”</p><p>Koepka had alerted the PGA Tour of his plans before the LIV announcement, according to one person aware of communication. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it has not been publicly disclosed.</p><p>The first step for Koepka to return would be to re-apply for membership. He was not among the LIV players who were part of the antitrust lawsuit filed against the PGA Tour in 2022.</p><p>US Open becomes first major to offer exemptions to LIV Golf players</p><p>Koepka, who spent 47 weeks at No. 1 in the world in 2018 and 2019, was one of the biggest signings by LIV when it launched in 2022. He had been coping with injuries and later suggested he might not have joined had his health been better.</p><p>He had been part of a meeting at the 2022 U.S. Open with top PGA Tour players a week earlier encouraging them to rally around the tour. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan had even gone to Koepka’s wedding in the Caribbean weeks before he jumped over to LIV.</p><p>Koepka was the first LIV player to win a major in 2023 when he won the PGA Championship at Oak Hill for his fifth major. Bryson DeChambeau won the U.S. Open the following year.</p><p>Koepka won five times on LIV Golf, but he had only two top 10s — his best was a runner-up — in 2025 and finished 31st in the standings of the 54-man circuit. He missed the cut in five of the eight tournaments he played outside LIV this year, including three majors.</p><p>A blunt speaker, Koepka had expressed frustration earlier in the year that LIV wasn’t as far along as he hoped it would be.</p><p>His departure leaves DeChambeau and Jon Rahm, both two-time major champions, as the biggest draws in the league that also includes Ryder Cup player Tyrrell Hatton.</p><p>LIV did not say how Koepka would be replaced. The league has signed only Victor Perez and Laurie Canter for the 2026 season, which starts in February in Saudi Arabia. It has a “promotions” tournament in January where two players can gain entry into LIV.</p><p>The league also is awaiting word on its application to become part of the Official World Golf Ranking system. One of the sticking points has been LIV selecting players for its circuit, which is different from the other tours that are part of the ranking system.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Not sure if these all had criminal histories beyond being in the US illegally.</p><p>After some discussion, the team decided on a compromise.</p><p>ICE official 2</p><p>Oct. 29, 6:30 p.m.</p><p>I’d like to try to put this out without focusing on the aliens or their crimes, but to demonstrate that we’re out working hard.</p><p>Instead of arguing they’d snared hardened criminals, officials wrote a caption saying the arrests showed the dangers of “illegal aliens … behind the wheel.”</p><p>Then, to maximize the video’s chances of going viral, they needed a soundtrack.</p><p>ICE video producer 1</p><p>Oct. 30, 1:13 p.m.</p><p>think country songs... this is Houston after all.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>Oct. 30, 1:39 p.m.</p><p>I feel like we need something a little more hard-core</p><p>They settled on a rap song by Nbhd Nick, which his label would later tell The Post was used without permission, that starts, “Oh, you thought this was a game, huh?”</p><p>The video was posted to ICE’s social media channels, where it has been viewed more than 1 million times in total.</p><p>For years, this ICE team had run like a routine government communications shop, dispensing public service announcements and news releases few Americans would see. But during President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE’s public affairs arm has rapidly transformed into an influencer-style media machine, churning out flashy videos of tactical operations and immigration raids.</p><p>The internal communications reviewed by The Post show how the ICE team has coordinated with the White House, working to satisfy Trump aides’ demands to “flood the airwaves,” as one official urged in the messages, with brash content showing immigrants being chased, grabbed and detained.</p><p>They also show federal officials mocking immigrants in crass terms and discussing video edits that might help legitimize the administration’s aggressive stance. The team also knowingly used copyright-protected music without permission from the rights holders, among other techniques designed to boost their online attention.</p><p>Six current or former officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, told The Post that the video effort had broken from the more careful and methodical work of past administrations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.</p><p>The Post reviewed chats and other materials provided by people familiar with internal discussions. They did so on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the disclosures.</p><p>David Lapan, the first DHS press secretary during Trump’s first term and a longtime critic who has argued the second Trump administration politicized the agency, said the current strategy is unrecognizable compared to the more “professional and buttoned-up” operations under past presidents that worked to describe law enforcement activities clinically and apolitically, for fear of inflaming anger against agents in the field.</p><p>“We were supposed to present the facts, not hype things up. But this veers into propaganda, into creating fear,” said Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel. “We didn’t have this meme-ification of various serious operations, these things that are life or death. … It’s not a joking matter. But that’s the way they’re treating it now.”</p><p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “President Trump and his entire team are working at breakneck speed to keep our promises, deport criminal illegal aliens, and get information out to the public — that’s a good thing and the American people deserve no less.”</p><p>DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the White House had given the communications wings of DHS and ICE “autonomy to create content that is effectively reaching the American public.” The social media posts that used copyrighted material without permission had been preapproved by administration lawyers, she said.</p><p>DHS public affairs officials, she added, were proud to break with the strategies of past administrations because their work has proved more successful at getting people’s attention.</p><p>“They were irrelevant,” she said, “and we’ve made it matter.”</p><p>Launched after the Sept. 11 attacks, ICE and DHS had always functioned as traditional law enforcement agencies focused on public safety and with minimal tools for self-promotion.</p><p>Their public affairs divisions employed small teams of video producers, mostly for unexceptional tasks: facilitating TV interviews, running the cameras at workforce retirement ceremonies, recording safety commercials for the Super Bowl. Some producers traveled to make videos when DHS agents took down sex abusers or crime rings. Video producers would film targeted operations, a current DHS official said, but immigration enforcement was only a fraction of the workload.</p><p>After the start of Trump’s second term, however, ICE’s ranks swelled as federal agents were diverted to immigration enforcement and the One Big Beautiful Bill tripled the agency’s annual budget to deliver on the White House’s promises to secure the southern border and speed up deportations. ICE’s average arrest count jumped from around 300 a day last year to more than 800 a day since Trump took office, according to a Post analysis of ICE data released by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p>DHS’s media operation was no exception. Public affairs teams were injected with a new crew of political appointees who had orders from the White House to treat immigration as their top priority and produce dramatized visuals of ICE operations and arrests to command user attention, the current and former officials told The Post. The video teams’ workload exploded, and immigration became the only topic anyone could pursue, according to interviews.</p><p>“We’re not doing child pornography cases. We’re not doing human trafficking cases,” one current DHS official told The Post. “Everything is immigration.”</p><p>ICE’s public affairs team included several dozen public affairs officers, producers and strategists, scattered between its Washington headquarters and local field offices across the country, current DHS officials said. Members of ICE’s visual communications team, embedded in the public affairs division and known as “viscom,” began recording in the field more frequently, accompanying officers on raids and removal operations, shooting video day and night, interviews and chats showed. Any video producer who witnessed a particularly cinematic scene was expected to alert their supervisors, so the agency and the White House could promote it on their social media channels. Employees on ICE’s “digital engagement” team then raced to edit and post the footage on social media in hopes of securing a viral win.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE’s assistant director for public affairs, frequently requested “good arrest videos” and asked the team to devote its energy to capturing “high profile arrests,” the internal messages show. Laszlo Baksay, a deputy assistant director, asked the public affairs team in the chat to flag stories where “aliens with criminal history are being employed,” to counter media reports that the agency was grabbing “ordinary aliens just trying to earn a living.”</p><p>Covington and Baksay declined to comment further on the chat messages.</p><p>The team began working like a professional influencer operation, creating a “social media check list” of caught-on-camera arrests, sharing metrics with senior officials, using paid social media tracking tools and cataloguing all of their Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads and X posts, ranked by impressions and engagement rate.</p><p>Covington pushed the team in internal chats in late May to be more “proactive” in pushing out videos.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>May 21, 7:52 p.m.</p><p>What PR tactics can we deploy that we don’t typically? Should we feed info to an influencer? ... Using judgment to ID something likely to go viral or bubble up and gain attention. Right now we are learning from the media, let’s feed the beast first with the good work ICE is doing each and every day.</p><p>A week after Covington’s message, in late May, the team got its first viral video. The clip showed ICE agents leaping out of an SUV and confronting men on the curb of a home improvement store in Baltimore. The men were shoved face down onto the street and handcuffed while an agent said, “Calle la boca” — in Spanish, “shut your mouth.” In an X post, ICE called the video “action-packed.”</p><p>ICE official 3</p><p>May 28, 11:57 a.m.</p><p>2.1M views and nearly 7,000 shares in 13 hours! Awesome work!</p><p>But the real celebration came shortly after, when the White House reposted the video on its Instagram and X accounts, labeling it an “EPIC Takedown.”</p><p>ICE official 4</p><p>May 28, 3:22 p.m.</p><p>White House just ran with it!</p><p>The post, from one of the team’s political appointees, led to a burst of hearts and shock-face emojis.</p><p>As the media operation ramped up, DHS posted several videos containing clear errors around their operations, using misleading footage that showed scenes recorded thousands of miles away from where the video described, The Post has previously reported.</p><p>Other edits were aimed at presenting events in ways that supported the administration’s narratives. In May, Covington asked, at the White House’s request, whether a video of a deportation flight from Texas could be re-edited so that the clips “don’t feature tons of females?” An ICE official responded that a video producer would “re-edit the b-roll to exclude the females,” the chats show.</p><p>Officials worked to find ways to describe many of the people arrested as the “Worst of the Worst,” a slogan DHS and ICE began using in January to argue that their agents hunted only the most dangerous criminals. When one official asked in the chat what producers should say in their videos when arrestees had no criminal history, another responded that they should work to find something else “newsworthy” to highlight, like an “egregious immigration history.”</p><p>Public affairs officers were told to rewrite their news releases and online posts with stronger, more aggressive language if they wanted the agency’s main communications channels to promote them, one said in an interview. “If the truth of the operation does not match the narrative of the ‘worst of the worst,’ it’s going to be killed,” the official said.</p><p>The team gave right-wing media figures premium access to immigration operations and received favorable coverage. In June, about three months before he was killed, right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk posted what he said was “exclusive footage” of ICE officials arresting a “thug.” Covington highlighted the moment in the team’s chat, thanking one official “for getting great footage on today’s arrest.”</p><p>Right-wing influencers with large followings, including “Dr. Phil” McGraw and Libs of TikTok’s Chaya Raichik, were regularly invited to ride along with law enforcement agents and interview senior officials, according to The Post’s review of their coverage. The pro-Trump influencer Benny Johnson donned a Border Patrol tactical vest to watch a raid at a Walmart in the Chicago area alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem. His X clip celebrating the “amazing” operation’s “wild scenes” has been viewed 1.6 million times.</p><p>A Libs of TikTok representative declined to comment on the relationship. Representatives for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of McGraw said he had been invited by White House border czar Tom Homan to document ICE enforcement in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year.</p><p>In pursuit of more viral video, DHS brought in new public affairs staff members with atypical backgrounds and authorized them to “go out and capture content,” as a chat message said. A MAGA women’s lifestyle influencer, an L.A.-based wedding videographer and a Canadian-born actor who played a “mountain man” in a cable-TV show joined the team.</p><p>DHS encouraged the hires to become intimately involved with agency affairs, the chats and interviews showed. In June, when ICE agents were raiding farms in rural Missouri, the former actor noted it would be a prime chance to make a video. “Would be great to get something like that on film,” he wrote in the chats, suggesting a tagline: “We are everywhere, we will find you.”</p><p>Later, when ICE officials complained about negative media coverage, he worked to bolster their spirits.</p><p>ICE official 4</p><p>June 20, 12:18 p.m.</p><p>The good news is half the country is seeing it, and equally as frustrated. those in the “middle” are who we will continue to slowly reach... It’s a war!</p><p>By June, the public affairs team had for weeks been showing signs of overwork, with some employees consistently working overtime to help satisfy the White House’s constant demands for more content, the chat messages showed.</p><p>The team had discussed bringing on contract videographers to help address outstanding tasks — like a new request to shadow every operation of ICE’s Special Response Team, the elite SWAT-like unit that handles its most dangerous arrests.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>May, 9 10:42 a.m.</p><p>All- as expected, I am getting pressure now about our video capabilities. I need ALL video our PAOs and videographers have captured this week ASAP in one link. This should be the only priority for right now.</p><p>But when protests over mass deportation swept L.A. and Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard in June, the White House ramped up the pressure yet again. Top officials wanted ICE’s public affairs unit to produce more visuals, messages from June 10 show.</p><p>ICE official 5</p><p>June 10, 12:33 p.m.</p><p>We need all hands on deck to start “flooding the airwaves” per White house direction on ALL ICE arrests nationwide today. The request is to flood social and traditional media with imagery of ICE arrests.</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:41 p.m.</p><p>How many socials do we have in the que that we paused from the last 2 days?</p><p>ICE official 6</p><p>June 10, 12:42 p.m.</p><p>“TONS”</p><p></p><p></p><p>He said there’s stuff loaded and ready to go</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:42 p.m.</p><p>do we have enough to post every 30 mins? Until midnight?</p><p>The National Guard deployment presented a challenge for a unit trained to cover preplanned and targeted operations: a vast, citywide video shoot where clashes with protesters could flare up at any time.</p><p>In the chats, the team strategized how to stretch out its content.</p><p>ICE official 5</p><p>June 10, 12:45 p.m.</p><p>My thought would be for locals to post and the HQ can re-tweet, unless there is something really juicy that would get more push coming from HQ.</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:50 p.m.</p><p>fire away!</p><p>Around 1 p.m., Covington, the ICE public affairs assistant director, instructed her team to highlight arrests in Los Angeles at the White House’s request.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>June 10, 1:18 p.m.</p><p>On White House Call - we need to be highlighting worst of worst LA arrests across relevant accounts/channels. I will be getting a LOT of content from all federal partners today. All flowing through me now.</p><p>ICE began to post a flurry of tweets on X in quick succession — almost every half hour. They included visuals of recent immigration raids and mug shots of people the agency said were undocumented immigrants with a criminal history.</p><p>ICE tweeted 38 times over 11 hours. Earlier in the day, the account had posted only three times.</p><p>Officials also floated more ideas to maximize coverage, including pulling in military videographers, known as “combat cameras,” to offer “direct support of designated hotspots.” One official warned the idea came with too many risks, in part because they had been trained for battle, not protests. “It’s different than war photography in a few distinct ways,” the official said.</p><p>The White House directive around the L.A. protests forced the agency to play more of an “attack-dog” role online to keep up with the administration’s demands, one former worker on the DHS media team told The Post.</p><p>“That was the turning point to get even more aggressive with their messaging, and to paint pictures of these places as war-torn,” he said. “There was a much more blustery edge, and a need to put stuff out as quickly as you can. You’re steamrolling everything.”</p><p>The White House has benefited from this symbiotic relationship: The most-watched video on its TikTok account, with more than 45 million views, included DHS operational footage, a photo of a crying arrestee and the caption, “Ahhh that deportation feeling …” (It has since been removed, but the White House declined to say why.)</p><p>In the weeks after the June 10 directive, many National Guard troops left L.A., but the ICE public affairs team kept working at a rapid pace, the chats showed. As plainclothes ICE agents began ramping up arrests of immigrants at courthouses, an ICE official urged the team to “flood all your local social with the imagery from the arrests!”</p><p>The pace became so demanding that one official complained of overwork.</p><p>ICE official 7</p><p>June 20, 11:53 a.m.</p><p>DHS knows we have very little staff right? I know it has been discussed but there has been no change to our staffing and they keep wanting more and more.</p><p>When video producers weren’t available, public affairs officers were sent into the field to record ICE activities on their phones — a footage “force multiplier,” one DHS official said in an interview. Officers were traveling more to fill the White House’s almost insatiable demand for visuals, another official said.</p><p>The push, however, left some of the officials fearful for their safety in the field. In July, DHS said, an ICE public affairs specialist was sent to the emergency room with a bloodied hand after being hit by a thrown rock outside a California marijuana farm.</p><p>During an all-team meeting attended by public affairs officers, an official said he had been sent in a T-shirt to scenes where agents were wearing body armor, an ICE official recalled. (An ICE spokesman said the agency now ensures that public affairs officials have protective equipment, including body armor and first aid kits.)</p><p>Still, public affairs officials have participated in the immigration operations. In September, Covington said in an internal chat message that she had been on a ride-along with federal agents when an immigrant from Venezuela was apprehended. “Target was a runner - I spotted him and we made the arrest,” she wrote.</p><p>She uploaded photos of the man in handcuffs and asked in the chat whether he had been a known gang member, saying he “had some interesting tats.” An ICE legal associate told her their files showed no evidence of gang membership. Some of her colleagues congratulated her nonetheless. “Go [Public Affairs Office] Go!” one replied.</p><p>The White House’s frenzy for more content, and DHS officials’ scramble to produce, led the team to push the boundaries in ways that disturbed some of its employees.</p><p>ICE’s X account posted a video of a bound protester in Portland, Ore., being wheeled into custody face down on a flatbed cart, with the background lyrics, “they see me rollin’.” DHS’s account posted a clip of Illinois protesters and said, “Get a job you imbecilic morons.” It also shared a Halloween-styled montage of arrestees’ mug shots and warned there would be “no sanctuary for creatures & criminals of the night.”</p><p>“They just went nuts,” a recently departed DHS producer told The Post. “It was no limit. … It was like if someone from Reddit took over.”</p><p>Some prosecutors in U.S. attorneys’ offices complained to public affairs officials that the brash social media posts could jeopardize their cases by raising questions about bias or tainting the jury pool, one official said. (McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said she’d not heard this and said that if officials are so concerned about it, they should convey it to her, not journalists.)</p><p>But that style of crass humor was also common in the ICE team’s internal chats. Four days after Trump’s inauguration, an official shared a meme that read like a warning to migrants inside the country: “Hide Yo Wife. Hide Yo Kids.” Another official poked fun at a migrant’s mug shot, labeling him an “MS13 heart throb” in reference to the gang.</p><p>In June, after Los Angeles Dodgers officials said they had blocked ICE agents from accessing their parking lots, one ICE official made a joke about the team’s Japanese superstar pitcher, who has played for American teams since 2018.</p><p>ICE official 8</p><p>June 20, 11:41 a.m.</p><p>Can we double check Shohei Ohtani’s immigration paperwork???</p><p>McLaughlin said that every organization has “conversations that you don’t think are going to get out to the public” but that she is not “going to lose sleep over” anything in the messages.</p><p>ICE’s shifting attitude toward public messaging was especially noticeable in its use of music without the artists’ or labels’ permission, current and former DHS officials said, which past administrations had been far more cautious about. Some officials said in the chat that they were indifferent to the potential perils. When one employee raised concerns about copyright violations, another wrote back, dismissing them.</p><p>At least five DHS and ICE videos have been taken down from X in recent months following complaints from representatives of the comedian Theo Von, the band MGMT, and rappers Jay-Z, Joey Valence, and Chamillionaire. Other companies and creators have complained that their intellectual property was used without permission, including the Pokémon Co., whose cartoon style was mimicked for a DHS video captioned “Gotta Catch ’Em All.”</p><p>Trump administration officials have defended the intensity of their media operation to reporters by saying it’s what Americans want: visual proof that Trump is fulfilling his promise to deport millions of immigrants nationwide.</p><p>But ICE’s social media onslaught appears to have done little to change Americans’ attitudes en masse. The share of Americans saying immigration is a good thing for the country leaped to 79 percent in July, a record high, a Gallup poll found in July. About 62 percent of Americans said they disliked how Trump was handling the issue.</p><p>Despite this, the media operations at DHS show no signs of slowing down. Inside the ICE team, the chats showed, many were proud of their work — and committed for the long haul.</p><p>In August, after an ICE official shared census numbers showing the country’s immigrant population had dropped by 2 million, an ICE legal associate responded simply: “Only 40 million to go.”</p><p>About this story</p><p>Videos from ICEGov/X.

{"details":"<p>2025 was a year of extremes in beauty culture. The $450 million industry felt more polarized than ever, with a push towards “low maintenance” routines that encouraged us to ditch our mascaras or go makeup-free entirely, Pamela Anderson style. The shift came from the fact that this low-effort look often required “high maintenance” treatments like lash lifts, teeth whitening, laser hair removal, or even cosmetic procedures, to be achieved. While some brands were telling us to “redefine beauty on your terms,” others were selling us compression face shapewear to sculpt our jaws.</p><p>The scope of beauty widened, too. In November, the Canadian actress and entrepreneur Shay Mitchell made headlines when she launched Rini, a skincare line that offers hydrogel sheet masks for children as young as 3. We also saw the rise of canine beauty, with vegan pH-balanced luxury shampoos infused with vitamins, coat oils and dry shampoos that double as doggie fragrance. No corporeal zone was off-limits either, as previously undiscussed body parts were platformed in new ways. The New York Times described scalps as the new “It” area as more people spent money on high-end head spas, while earlier this summer, Vogue Business declared the next wellness craze to be “booty beauty,” as more brands flock to create all-over-body deodorants, bottom care and “hole serums.” Kate Winslet summed it up best when responding to today’s beauty standards in a recent interview with The Times of London: “It is f***ing chaos out there.”</p><p>To help make sense of it all, CNN asked three prolific beauty writers to sound-off, unfiltered, on the moments they believe defined the year that was.</p><p>In 2025, with every inch of the human body commodified at last — see: “holecare” — the beauty industry set its sights on the nonhuman. Introducing: canine cosmetics, the break-out category of the year!</p><p>Lil Luv Dog, co-founded by the former COO of Kim Kardashian West Brands and backed by $1 million in venture capital, launched in August with $36, EWG-verified dry shampoo (“so your dog doesn’t smell… like dog”). Welltayl followed in October; its Skin + Coat Care Kit, $98, can “cleanse, hydrate and protect without disrupting the skin barrier.” Ex-beauty editor Alexandra Pauly will debut her “beauty for the beast” line, Biche, next month. The fur oil features a “signature fragrance” for “humans to smell and enjoy,” Pauly tells CNN.</p><p>And humans do seem to enjoy this. Morgan Stanley estimates the pet grooming industry will grow over 7% annually through 2030, potentially outpacing the growth of beauty products for people (5% annually through 2030, according to McKinsey & Company). Allure readers even asked for more “pet beauty content” in a 2025 survey.</p><p>But why?</p><p>I’d blame anthropomorphization, for starters. As more people opt out of parenthood, dogs are the new kids. Consider scented coat conditioner the “baby sheet mask” of fur babies.</p><p>Evolutionarily speaking, people also see themselves in their pups. Both species communicate through facial expressions, and dogs have developed new facial muscles over time — brow-furrowers, mainly — to better mimic their masters. (I pray Botox for bulldogs isn’t on the horizon.) Maybe this explains why Lil Luv Dog and Biche market their wares as “self-care for dogs,” despite the dog doing none of the care. The “self” is the owner; the person is sublimated into the pooch; the beauty industry has made you its bitch (uh, Biche).</p><p>Here’s my personal pet theory: The early modern invention of the pet coincided with the shaping of the modern family and women’s unequal status within it, as professor Juliana Schiesari argues in her 2010 book “Beasts and Beauties.” Women and dogs were domesticated together, in other words — made to be docile, to do as they’re told. As the country tightens the leash on women, could dog beauty be some sort of subconscious coping mechanism? A way to make peace with our own domestication?</p><p>At the very least, a “de-caninizing” beauty standard for dogs is a bleak parallel to today’s dehumanizing beauty standard for people (“Instagram Face,” cyborg-like skin, AI models). What’s next? Ozempic for Old English Sheepdogs? Well, yes. That is in the works.</p><p>Jessica DeFino writes the anti-beauty Substack newsletter “Flesh World.”</p><p>In 2025, people were a lot chattier about what aesthetic treatments and procedures they’ve undergone, what they’d like to have done, and also what they speculate certain celebrities have had done — many of whom have been happier than ever to disclose specifics on social media. Kylie Jenner responded to a TikToker asking for her “boob job recipe” (“445 cc, moderate profile, half under the muscle!!! silicone!!! garth fisher!!! hope this helps lol”) in a surprising attitude shift, considering Jenner had been evasive about her lip filler in the past. Her mother, Kris Jenner, also sparked media attention for her second facelift in 15 years, which was lauded online as impressively natural-looking, and spiked interest in such clinical terms as “SMAS lift” and “deep plane” — two facelift techniques associated with Jenner’s results. Perhaps more surprising was Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, who this year went public about her breast augmentation, lower blepharoplasty and earlobe reconstruction. She told PEOPLE Magazine: “I feel like nowadays with social media, you see everyone and you’re like, ‘Oh, my god, how does she look so good?’ Social media is not real, so that’s why I try to be as transparent as possible.”</p><p>The public’s overall sentiment was “wow, they look great” — a far cry from less than a decade ago, when plastic surgery was still quite socially stigmatized and misunderstood. Back then, frozen Botox face, cat-like cheek sculpting and exaggerated “duck lips” were the butt of jokes (until so many people adopted amalgamations of these features that they’ve since become part of the beauty standard lexicon). Considering our collective screen dependency, voyeuristic relationship with influencers and the increased accessibility of these procedures, it was only a matter of time before our distaste for overt vanity evolved into public curiosity. Now to admit one’s financial investment in their physical appearance — whether it was inspired by insecurity or ambition — is both vulnerable and relatable (relatability being one of the most effective ways celebrities create a sense of authenticity and connection with fans). Today, beauty transparency is framed as empowering, and surgery as self-care.</p><p>Ironically, this increased authenticity has raised the bar, and the pressure for everyone to keep up has never been greater. Now, as non-invasive treatments like Botox, fillers, laser facials, and manicures are all normalized in the mainstream, the baseline of acceptable appearances has become way more expensive — excluding people at a time of growing economic inequality as well. It’s made us skeptical of the beauty we see online as a result of medical intervention, paranoid that everyone else is getting injections and lifts, and further stigmatized what natural aging actually looks like.</p><p>But beauty evolves with humanity — it’s a key form of expression, and part of how we connect with each other. I think it can also be used as a tool of rebellion against a tech-driven culture that threatens to make us obsolete. Now that AI has us doubting everything we see online, I hope we’ll be drawn back to appreciating imperfect, unique human qualities. Maybe in 2026, we’ll all be fatigued with picture-perfect faces, and reconsider beauty’s real value for us individually and collectively.</p><p>Sable Yong is a freelance writer and was formerly a beauty editor at Allure. Her book “Die Hot With a Vengeance: Essays on Vanity” was published in 2024.</p><p>It first started towards the end of last year, when a debate sprang up on TikTok over whether women with bushes were more trustworthy. In January, videos of users chanting the words “full bush in a bikini” went viral and quickly became a catchphrase for women resisting the societal pressure of body hair removal. By April the conversation had taken over an entire corner of the platform, now dedicated to pubic hair. #BushTok had influencers, memes, “bush aura readings” (predicting the style/design of a celebrity’s pubic hair based purely on vibes). People were bonding over shared acceptance and appreciation of their natural body hair, refusing to be embarrassed over something that has so long been considered taboo.</p><p>But it wasn’t just happening online. After the French luxury house Maison Margiela sent merkins down the runway last year, designers in 2025 presented collections with looks that referenced pubic hair from the faux fur high-cut bodysuit by the New York-based designer Kim Shui to Swedish label Acne Studio’s fuzzy all-in-ones. In October, for his first collection as the designer of Jean Paul Gaultier, Duran Lantink put models in hairy trompe-l’œil-style catsuits, while Kim Kardashian — who last year first teased us with a Skims faux fur bikini — fully committed with a range of merkins in various shades and hair types. Soon headlines were proclaiming the bush was back, “Saturday Night Live” was centering skits around bushes, they were appearing on the cover of magazines and US rapper Ashnikko was singing about not wanting a “city boy scared of the bush” on her 2025 single “Sticky Fingers.”</p><p>In truth, the full bush conversation has been a welcome bit of body positivity in a beauty landscape which has often felt very bleak, if not downright dystopian. As beauty director at Dazed, my work aims to challenge the pressures young people feel to conform to oppressive, unrealistic standards, and champion beauty as a joyful tool for self-expression. From blepharoplasty to buccal fat removal, it seems like there’s a new surgical treatment trending every week, many of them increasingly undetectable. Meanwhile, the “beauty backslide” has seen a cultural return to conservative values and aesthetics, worryingly thin bodies, and bizarre TikTok trends that border on physiognomy.</p><p>In a sea of skincare for toddlers, Botox in your 20s and facelifts for the barely 30s, it’s no wonder the pieces I commissioned on pubic hair (from meeting #BushTok influencers and exploring full bush fashion, to advice on growing out your bush) have been some of the most talked about pieces on the site this year.</p><p>These conversations around full bush positivity have often been lighthearted and full of humor, but that never took away from their importance. Accepting and embracing the natural aspects of our bodies feels increasingly hard to do and therefore never more vital. In a time where our appearances are being constantly modified (digitally and surgically), frozen, smoothed over and shrunk down, being part of the full bush agenda feels like an act of self-preservation.</p><p>Alex Peters is the beauty director at Dazed magazine.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Lithium-ion batteries are found in everything from smartphones to cars, and while they are generally very safe if stored and charged correctly, there are thousands of documented cases of them catching fire — sometimes with deadly consequences.</p><p>Lithium-ion batteries contain flammable electrolytes — liquid solutions of lithium salts dissolved in organic solvents that allow the electric charge to flow. The batteries can become unstable under certain conditions, such as physical damage like piercing, overcharging, extreme temperatures or manufacturing defects. When things go wrong, a battery can heat up and catch fire very rapidly, undergoing a dangerous chain reaction called a “thermal runaway.”</p><p>Commercial aviation is especially exposed to the problem, because of how ubiquitous battery-powered gadgets are on planes and how dangerous a fire in the cabin or cargo hold can be. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has long prohibited carrying spare lithium-ion batteries in checked baggage and mandates that all batteries brought into the cabin must remain accessible. The agency recorded 89 battery incidents involving smoke, fire or extreme heat on passenger and cargo aircraft in 2024, and 38 in the first half of 2025.</p><p>These incidents can lead to the total loss of an aircraft, like the Airbus A321 that was gutted by flames in January in Busan, South Korea. The fire was likely started by a power bank stored in an overhead compartment, according to investigators, which has led some airlines to ban the devices.</p><p>But the risks of thermal runaways extend to homes, particularly vulnerable to e-bike or e-scooter battery fires, and businesses of all kinds: a survey conducted by insurance provider Aviva in 2024, among over 500 UK businesses found that just over half had experienced an incident linked to lithium-ion batteries, such as sparking, fires and explosions.</p><p>Researchers all over the world are working to solve the problem by developing safer batteries, for example by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a more fire-resistant solid or gel. However, such solutions require significant changes to current production lines, an obstacle to widespread adoption.</p><p>Now, a team of researchers from The Chinese University of Hong Kong has proposed a change in lithium-ion battery design that could rapidly integrate into current manufacturing methods, because it simply involves swapping chemicals in the existing electrolyte solution.</p><p>The method was detailed earlier this year in a study led by Yue Sun, now a postdoctoral fellow at Virginia Tech: “I think the most difficult thing for people to realize about batteries is that when you try to optimize performance, sometimes you compromise safety,” she said, explaining that increasing performance requires a focus on chemical reactions that happen at room temperature, while increasing safety focuses on reactions that happen at high temperatures.</p><p>“So we came up with an idea to break this trade off by designing a temperature-sensitive material, which can provide a good performance at room temperature, but can also offer good stability at high temperatures.”</p><p>Battery fires generally start when part of the electrolyte breaks down under stress and releases heat in a chain reaction. Sun and her colleagues’ design uses a new electrolyte that includes two solvents to stop this chain reaction in its tracks.</p><p>At room temperature, the first solvent keeps the battery’s chemical structure tight, optimizing performance, but if the battery starts to heat up, the second solvent takes over and prevents a fire by loosening that structure and slowing down reactions that could result in a thermal runaway.</p><p>In lab tests, a battery with this new design that was pierced with a nail saw its temperature rise by only 3.5°C (6.3° Fahrenheit), instead of the 555°C (999° Fahrenheit) spike that occurred with a traditional battery. The researchers say there is no negative impact on the battery’s performance or durability, and it retained over 80% of its capacity after 1,000 charging cycles.</p><p>“Since our invention is the electrolyte, it can be easily implemented into commercially available systems — you basically just swap in the new electrolyte,” said Yi-Chun Lu, a professor of mechanical and automation engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and one of the authors of the study.</p><p>“In the manufacturing process, the most difficult aspect is the electrodes, or the solid part. But the electrolyte that we are swapping is a liquid, so you can directly inject it into the cell without any new equipment or new process,” Lu added.</p><p>The new chemical recipe would slightly increase the manufacturing cost, but Lu said that at scale, the price would be “at a very similar level” to current batteries. The researchers are interested in pursuing the idea commercially, and are currently in discussion with battery manufacturers to bring the design to market, which could take between three to five years, according to Lu.</p><p>In tests, the researchers made a battery large enough to power a tablet, but Lu said that there needs to be more “validation” to scale the design up to the size required for cars, for example.</p><p>Researchers in the field of lithium battery safety who didn’t participate in the study expressed positive views of the work when contacted by CNN for comment. Donal Finegan, a senior scientist at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the new design is an exciting development, and it translates into a safety battery that can tolerate hot conditions and short circuiting without causing a fire: “The strategically chosen electrolyte solution is scalable and does not significantly impede the cycle life of the battery, which helps eliminate many barriers towards mass adoption in commercial battery systems,” he added.</p><p>The study explored a range of electrolyte compositions and found options where there was a balance between battery cells lasting many cycles while also maintaining stability at higher temperatures, according to Gary Koenig, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia. “From a manufacturing perspective, implementing a new electrolyte can be achieved in a relatively short timeframe as long as there is not an unforeseen processing compatibility issue,” he said in an email.</p><p>Jorge Seminario, a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M University, said in an email that the new design addresses one of the most critical challenges in high-energy lithium-ion batteries, which is achieving both safety and performance: “The study is highly innovative and impactful, offering a practical solution to a critical bottleneck in lithium-ion battery safety,” he added.</p><p>Correction:\n A previous version of this story misstated the Fahrenheit values for the battery temperature changes observed in lab tests.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A Jeffrey Epstein survivor who has only ever chosen to identify herself anonymously as “Jane Doe” was startled to learn that her name appeared multiple times in the Justice Department’s release of the Epstein files that began on Friday, and she told CNN in an exclusive interview Monday that her attempts to get the DOJ to redact her name from the publicly available documents had been unsuccessful so far.</p><p>Jane Doe said she both witnessed and experienced Epstein’s abuse in 2009 and reported her experience to the FBI the same year. That time frame is particularly significant, because it was after Epstein pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in Florida in the aftermath of receiving a non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors. Epstein would serve just 13 months in prison, though for much of his jail sentence Epstein was allowed to be out on a work-release program — a period of time when his abuse continued, survivors have said.</p><p>CNN verified that Jane Doe’s name appears many times in the Epstein files released so far by DOJ. CNN is choosing to only describe Jane Doe’s experience with and allegations against Epstein in broad and agreed-upon terms to protect her identity. She said that since Friday, she has received unsolicited phone calls.</p><p>CNN has reached out to DOJ for comment on Jane Doe’s unredacted inclusion in the files.</p><p>Jane Doe alerted DOJ officials over the weekend that her information was not redacted, according to an email exchange viewed by CNN. An official responded that they would convey her message to those handling the documents and redactions. Jane Doe followed up again on Sunday to inform DOJ that her name remained public in the Epstein files. Her name was still viewable in multiple places as of Monday afternoon.</p><p>In the interview with CNN, Jane Doe said she has been asking federal authorities for her FBI file for years. She said she is mortified that the DOJ failed to properly redact her — and other survivors’ names — and said her entire experience gives her very little confidence in the agency’s ability to protect current and future victims who might report abuse.</p><p>“The reason I feel so passionate is it’s not just about me and what happened. I fear for the little girl who’s calling the FBI right now and asking for help,” Jane Doe said. “I am so afraid for her, because if I have to do all of this right now… I have no words. I just have no words. It hurts my heart. It haunts me to my core.”</p><p>Jane Doe was one of more than a dozen survivors — along with family members of the late victim Virginia Giuffre — who issued a new statement Monday raising a myriad of concerns with DOJ’s release of the files. They said that there were “abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation,” some victims’ identities that were left unredacted “causing real and immediate harm,” and that there were no financial documents. The survivors said they have found it “difficult or impossible” to search for materials relevant to their own experiences.</p><p>CNN reported on Friday in the immediate aftermath of the DOJ’s release that survivors were struggling to navigate the agency’s online “Epstein Library,” and not having much luck finding information about their own cases.</p><p>“There has been no communication with survivors or our representatives as to what was withheld from release, or why hundreds of thousands of documents have not been disclosed by the legal deadline, or how DOJ will ensure that no more victim names are wrongly disclosed,” the statement says. “While clearer communication would not change the fact that a law was broken, its absence suggests an ongoing intent to keep survivors and the public in the dark as much as possible and as long as possible.”</p><p>Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor and a lead writer of the group statement, told CNN in an interview Monday morning that the DOJ’s handling of the release of the files represents “the opposite of transparency.”</p><p>“There was no one that approached us and said, ‘Hey, we want to do the right thing by survivors. Let’s have a conversation about this,” she said. “It’s that black and white. It’s: the Department of Justice broke a law signed by the president, period.”</p><p>Asked for comment on the survivors’ Monday statement, DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said: “As the Attorney General has stated, the Department of Justice has been in contact with victims, their lawyers, and victims groups. The DOJ and SDNY are undergoing an arduous effort to protect victims through redactions as documents are released, and the Attorney General encourages victims or their attorneys to come forward with concerns or additional information that could be helpful in the ongoing investigation.”</p><p>Survivors CNN has spoken with said they have not been contacted by the Justice Department about the Epstein files. Some lawyers representing Epstein victims said they received DOJ outreach to discuss redactions before last week’s release.</p><p>The DOJ has said that the agency is continuing to work through necessary redactions, and that hundreds of thousands more documents will be released in the coming weeks.</p><p>Michaels, who is in close touch with a number of other Epstein survivors, said she was not aware of any example of a fellow survivor finding new information from the DOJ’s files about their own experiences that they were looking for – with the single exception of Maria Farmer, whose 1996 complaint about Epstein was included in Friday’s disclosure.</p><p>Asked what actions, if any, the survivors might take next, she said: “We just want to pause right now and assess.”</p><p>Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, said on X Monday morning that “the DOJ must stop protecting rich & powerful men who were not charged or those who sabotaged the prosecution.”</p><p>Khanna called on the DOJ to release, among other things, FBI witness interviews that name other men, and Epstein’s emails seized from his computer.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Messages reveal how the agency has raced to satisfy the White House by pumping out videos of confrontations and arrests.</p><p>For the Immigration and Customs Enforcement public affairs team, the nighttime operation across metro Houston in October was a gold mine.</p><p>An ICE video producer shadowed agents as they pulled over and handcuffed more than 120 suspected undocumented immigrants, then sent the footage to a private team chatroom.</p><p>ICE official 1</p><p>Oct. 29, 2:10 p.m.</p><p>Arrests are wonderful!</p><p>ICE video producer 1</p><p>Oct. 29, 2:13 p.m.</p><p>Great shooting!</p><p>Across thousands of internal ICE messages reviewed by The Washington Post, this kind of celebration has become commonplace. The messages show how the team has worked closely with the White House, which has urged them to produce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.</p><p>Before officials could post the Houston video, they had to figure out how to frame it. Officials did not know if all the arrestees had criminal records, they wrote in the chats, undermining a slogan the team had worked to promote on social media: that ICE targeted the “Worst of the Worst.”</p><p>ICE video producer 2</p><p>Oct. 29, 2:36 p.m.</p><p>We made several dozen arrests today very quickly.

But during President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE’s public affairs arm has rapidly transformed into an influencer-style media machine, churning out flashy videos of tactical operations and immigration raids.</p><p>The internal communications reviewed by The Post show how the ICE team has coordinated with the White House, working to satisfy Trump aides’ demands to “flood the airwaves,” as one official urged in the messages, with brash content showing immigrants being chased, grabbed and detained.</p><p>They also show federal officials mocking immigrants in crass terms and discussing video edits that might help legitimize the administration’s aggressive stance. The team also knowingly used copyright-protected music without permission from the rights holders, among other techniques designed to boost their online attention.</p><p>Six current or former officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, told The Post that the video effort had broken from the more careful and methodical work of past administrations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.</p><p>The Post reviewed chats and other materials provided by people familiar with internal discussions. They did so on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the disclosures.</p><p>David Lapan, the first DHS press secretary during Trump’s first term and a longtime critic who has argued the second Trump administration politicized the agency, said the current strategy is unrecognizable compared to the more “professional and buttoned-up” operations under past presidents that worked to describe law enforcement activities clinically and apolitically, for fear of inflaming anger against agents in the field.</p><p>“We were supposed to present the facts, not hype things up. But this veers into propaganda, into creating fear,” said Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel. “We didn’t have this meme-ification of various serious operations, these things that are life or death. … It’s not a joking matter. But that’s the way they’re treating it now.”</p><p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “President Trump and his entire team are working at breakneck speed to keep our promises, deport criminal illegal aliens, and get information out to the public — that’s a good thing and the American people deserve no less.”</p><p>DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the White House had given the communications wings of DHS and ICE “autonomy to create content that is effectively reaching the American public.” The social media posts that used copyrighted material without permission had been preapproved by administration lawyers, she said.</p><p>DHS public affairs officials, she added, were proud to break with the strategies of past administrations because their work has proved more successful at getting people’s attention.</p><p>“They were irrelevant,” she said, “and we’ve made it matter.”</p><p>Launched after the Sept. 11 attacks, ICE and DHS had always functioned as traditional law enforcement agencies focused on public safety and with minimal tools for self-promotion.</p><p>Their public affairs divisions employed small teams of video producers, mostly for unexceptional tasks: facilitating TV interviews, running the cameras at workforce retirement ceremonies, recording safety commercials for the Super Bowl. Some producers traveled to make videos when DHS agents took down sex abusers or crime rings. Video producers would film targeted operations, a current DHS official said, but immigration enforcement was only a fraction of the workload.</p><p>After the start of Trump’s second term, however, ICE’s ranks swelled as federal agents were diverted to immigration enforcement and the One Big Beautiful Bill tripled the agency’s annual budget to deliver on the White House’s promises to secure the southern border and speed up deportations. ICE’s average arrest count jumped from around 300 a day last year to more than 800 a day since Trump took office, according to a Post analysis of ICE data released by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p>DHS’s media operation was no exception. Public affairs teams were injected with a new crew of political appointees who had orders from the White House to treat immigration as their top priority and produce dramatized visuals of ICE operations and arrests to command user attention, the current and former officials told The Post. The video teams’ workload exploded, and immigration became the only topic anyone could pursue, according to interviews.</p><p>“We’re not doing child pornography cases. We’re not doing human trafficking cases,” one current DHS official told The Post. “Everything is immigration.”</p><p>ICE’s public affairs team included several dozen public affairs officers, producers and strategists, scattered between its Washington headquarters and local field offices across the country, current DHS officials said. Members of ICE’s visual communications team, embedded in the public affairs division and known as “viscom,” began recording in the field more frequently, accompanying officers on raids and removal operations, shooting video day and night, interviews and chats showed. Any video producer who witnessed a particularly cinematic scene was expected to alert their supervisors, so the agency and the White House could promote it on their social media channels. Employees on ICE’s “digital engagement” team then raced to edit and post the footage on social media in hopes of securing a viral win.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE’s assistant director for public affairs, frequently requested “good arrest videos” and asked the team to devote its energy to capturing “high profile arrests,” the internal messages show. Laszlo Baksay, a deputy assistant director, asked the public affairs team in the chat to flag stories where “aliens with criminal history are being employed,” to counter media reports that the agency was grabbing “ordinary aliens just trying to earn a living.”</p><p>Covington and Baksay declined to comment further on the chat messages.</p><p>The team began working like a professional influencer operation, creating a “social media check list” of caught-on-camera arrests, sharing metrics with senior officials, using paid social media tracking tools and cataloguing all of their Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads and X posts, ranked by impressions and engagement rate.</p><p>Covington pushed the team in internal chats in late May to be more “proactive” in pushing out videos.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>May 21, 7:52 p.m.</p><p>What PR tactics can we deploy that we don’t typically? Should we feed info to an influencer? ... Using judgment to ID something likely to go viral or bubble up and gain attention. Right now we are learning from the media, let’s feed the beast first with the good work ICE is doing each and every day.</p><p>A week after Covington’s message, in late May, the team got its first viral video. The clip showed ICE agents leaping out of an SUV and confronting men on the curb of a home improvement store in Baltimore. The men were shoved face down onto the street and handcuffed while an agent said, “Calle la boca” — in Spanish, “shut your mouth.” In an X post, ICE called the video “action-packed.”</p><p>ICE official 3</p><p>May 28, 11:57 a.m.</p><p>2.1M views and nearly 7,000 shares in 13 hours! Awesome work!</p><p>But the real celebration came shortly after, when the White House reposted the video on its Instagram and X accounts, labeling it an “EPIC Takedown.”</p><p>ICE official 4</p><p>May 28, 3:22 p.m.</p><p>White House just ran with it!</p><p>The post, from one of the team’s political appointees, led to a burst of hearts and shock-face emojis.</p><p>As the media operation ramped up, DHS posted several videos containing clear errors around their operations, using misleading footage that showed scenes recorded thousands of miles away from where the video described, The Post has previously reported.</p><p>Other edits were aimed at presenting events in ways that supported the administration’s narratives. In May, Covington asked, at the White House’s request, whether a video of a deportation flight from Texas could be re-edited so that the clips “don’t feature tons of females?” An ICE official responded that a video producer would “re-edit the b-roll to exclude the females,” the chats show.</p><p>Officials worked to find ways to describe many of the people arrested as the “Worst of the Worst,” a slogan DHS and ICE began using in January to argue that their agents hunted only the most dangerous criminals. When one official asked in the chat what producers should say in their videos when arrestees had no criminal history, another responded that they should work to find something else “newsworthy” to highlight, like an “egregious immigration history.”</p><p>Public affairs officers were told to rewrite their news releases and online posts with stronger, more aggressive language if they wanted the agency’s main communications channels to promote them, one said in an interview. “If the truth of the operation does not match the narrative of the ‘worst of the worst,’ it’s going to be killed,” the official said.</p><p>The team gave right-wing media figures premium access to immigration operations and received favorable coverage. In June, about three months before he was killed, right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk posted what he said was “exclusive footage” of ICE officials arresting a “thug.” Covington highlighted the moment in the team’s chat, thanking one official “for getting great footage on today’s arrest.”</p><p>Right-wing influencers with large followings, including “Dr. Phil” McGraw and Libs of TikTok’s Chaya Raichik, were regularly invited to ride along with law enforcement agents and interview senior officials, according to The Post’s review of their coverage. The pro-Trump influencer Benny Johnson donned a Border Patrol tactical vest to watch a raid at a Walmart in the Chicago area alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem. His X clip celebrating the “amazing” operation’s “wild scenes” has been viewed 1.6 million times.</p><p>A Libs of TikTok representative declined to comment on the relationship. Representatives for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of McGraw said he had been invited by White House border czar Tom Homan to document ICE enforcement in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year.</p><p>In pursuit of more viral video, DHS brought in new public affairs staff members with atypical backgrounds and authorized them to “go out and capture content,” as a chat message said. A MAGA women’s lifestyle influencer, an L.A.-based wedding videographer and a Canadian-born actor who played a “mountain man” in a cable-TV show joined the team.</p><p>DHS encouraged the hires to become intimately involved with agency affairs, the chats and interviews showed. In June, when ICE agents were raiding farms in rural Missouri, the former actor noted it would be a prime chance to make a video. “Would be great to get something like that on film,” he wrote in the chats, suggesting a tagline: “We are everywhere, we will find you.”</p><p>Later, when ICE officials complained about negative media coverage, he worked to bolster their spirits.</p><p>ICE official 4</p><p>June 20, 12:18 p.m.</p><p>The good news is half the country is seeing it, and equally as frustrated. those in the “middle” are who we will continue to slowly reach... It’s a war!</p><p>By June, the public affairs team had for weeks been showing signs of overwork, with some employees consistently working overtime to help satisfy the White House’s constant demands for more content, the chat messages showed.</p><p>The team had discussed bringing on contract videographers to help address outstanding tasks — like a new request to shadow every operation of ICE’s Special Response Team, the elite SWAT-like unit that handles its most dangerous arrests.</p><p>Emily Covington, ICE assistant director for public affairs</p><p>May, 9 10:42 a.m.</p><p>All- as expected, I am getting pressure now about our video capabilities. I need ALL video our PAOs and videographers have captured this week ASAP in one link. This should be the only priority for right now.</p><p>But when protests over mass deportation swept L.A. and Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard in June, the White House ramped up the pressure yet again. Top officials wanted ICE’s public affairs unit to produce more visuals, messages from June 10 show.</p><p>ICE official 5</p><p>June 10, 12:33 p.m.</p><p>We need all hands on deck to start “flooding the airwaves” per White house direction on ALL ICE arrests nationwide today. The request is to flood social and traditional media with imagery of ICE arrests.</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:41 p.m.</p><p>How many socials do we have in the que that we paused from the last 2 days?</p><p>ICE official 6</p><p>June 10, 12:42 p.m.</p><p>“TONS”</p><p></p><p></p><p>He said there’s stuff loaded and ready to go</p><p>Laszlo Baksay, ICE deputy assistant director</p><p>June 10, 12:42 p.m.</p><p>do we have enough to post every 30 mins?

I will be getting a LOT of content from all federal partners today. All flowing through me now.</p><p>ICE began to post a flurry of tweets on X in quick succession — almost every half hour. They included visuals of recent immigration raids and mug shots of people the agency said were undocumented immigrants with a criminal history.</p><p>ICE tweeted 38 times over 11 hours. Earlier in the day, the account had posted only three times.</p><p>Officials also floated more ideas to maximize coverage, including pulling in military videographers, known as “combat cameras,” to offer “direct support of designated hotspots.” One official warned the idea came with too many risks, in part because they had been trained for battle, not protests. “It’s different than war photography in a few distinct ways,” the official said.</p><p>The White House directive around the L.A. protests forced the agency to play more of an “attack-dog” role online to keep up with the administration’s demands, one former worker on the DHS media team told The Post.</p><p>“That was the turning point to get even more aggressive with their messaging, and to paint pictures of these places as war-torn,” he said. “There was a much more blustery edge, and a need to put stuff out as quickly as you can. You’re steamrolling everything.”</p><p>The White House has benefited from this symbiotic relationship: The most-watched video on its TikTok account, with more than 45 million views, included DHS operational footage, a photo of a crying arrestee and the caption, “Ahhh that deportation feeling …” (It has since been removed, but the White House declined to say why.)</p><p>In the weeks after the June 10 directive, many National Guard troops left L.A., but the ICE public affairs team kept working at a rapid pace, the chats showed. As plainclothes ICE agents began ramping up arrests of immigrants at courthouses, an ICE official urged the team to “flood all your local social with the imagery from the arrests!”</p><p>The pace became so demanding that one official complained of overwork.</p><p>ICE official 7</p><p>June 20, 11:53 a.m.</p><p>DHS knows we have very little staff right? I know it has been discussed but there has been no change to our staffing and they keep wanting more and more.</p><p>When video producers weren’t available, public affairs officers were sent into the field to record ICE activities on their phones — a footage “force multiplier,” one DHS official said in an interview. Officers were traveling more to fill the White House’s almost insatiable demand for visuals, another official said.</p><p>The push, however, left some of the officials fearful for their safety in the field. In July, DHS said, an ICE public affairs specialist was sent to the emergency room with a bloodied hand after being hit by a thrown rock outside a California marijuana farm.</p><p>During an all-team meeting attended by public affairs officers, an official said he had been sent in a T-shirt to scenes where agents were wearing body armor, an ICE official recalled. (An ICE spokesman said the agency now ensures that public affairs officials have protective equipment, including body armor and first aid kits.)</p><p>Still, public affairs officials have participated in the immigration operations. In September, Covington said in an internal chat message that she had been on a ride-along with federal agents when an immigrant from Venezuela was apprehended. “Target was a runner - I spotted him and we made the arrest,” she wrote.</p><p>She uploaded photos of the man in handcuffs and asked in the chat whether he had been a known gang member, saying he “had some interesting tats.” An ICE legal associate told her their files showed no evidence of gang membership. Some of her colleagues congratulated her nonetheless. “Go [Public Affairs Office] Go!” one replied.</p><p>The White House’s frenzy for more content, and DHS officials’ scramble to produce, led the team to push the boundaries in ways that disturbed some of its employees.</p><p>ICE’s X account posted a video of a bound protester in Portland, Ore., being wheeled into custody face down on a flatbed cart, with the background lyrics, “they see me rollin’.” DHS’s account posted a clip of Illinois protesters and said, “Get a job you imbecilic morons.” It also shared a Halloween-styled montage of arrestees’ mug shots and warned there would be “no sanctuary for creatures & criminals of the night.”</p><p>“They just went nuts,” a recently departed DHS producer told The Post. “It was no limit. … It was like if someone from Reddit took over.”</p><p>Some prosecutors in U.S. attorneys’ offices complained to public affairs officials that the brash social media posts could jeopardize their cases by raising questions about bias or tainting the jury pool, one official said. (McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said she’d not heard this and said that if officials are so concerned about it, they should convey it to her, not journalists.)</p><p>But that style of crass humor was also common in the ICE team’s internal chats. Four days after Trump’s inauguration, an official shared a meme that read like a warning to migrants inside the country: “Hide Yo Wife. Hide Yo Kids.” Another official poked fun at a migrant’s mug shot, labeling him an “MS13 heart throb” in reference to the gang.</p><p>In June, after Los Angeles Dodgers officials said they had blocked ICE agents from accessing their parking lots, one ICE official made a joke about the team’s Japanese superstar pitcher, who has played for American teams since 2018.</p><p>ICE official 8</p><p>June 20, 11:41 a.m.</p><p>Can we double check Shohei Ohtani’s immigration paperwork???</p><p>McLaughlin said that every organization has “conversations that you don’t think are going to get out to the public” but that she is not “going to lose sleep over” anything in the messages.</p><p>ICE’s shifting attitude toward public messaging was especially noticeable in its use of music without the artists’ or labels’ permission, current and former DHS officials said, which past administrations had been far more cautious about. Some officials said in the chat that they were indifferent to the potential perils. When one employee raised concerns about copyright violations, another wrote back, dismissing them.</p><p>At least five DHS and ICE videos have been taken down from X in recent months following complaints from representatives of the comedian Theo Von, the band MGMT, and rappers Jay-Z, Joey Valence, and Chamillionaire. Other companies and creators have complained that their intellectual property was used without permission, including the Pokémon Co., whose cartoon style was mimicked for a DHS video captioned “Gotta Catch ’Em All.”</p><p>Trump administration officials have defended the intensity of their media operation to reporters by saying it’s what Americans want: visual proof that Trump is fulfilling his promise to deport millions of immigrants nationwide.</p><p>But ICE’s social media onslaught appears to have done little to change Americans’ attitudes en masse. The share of Americans saying immigration is a good thing for the country leaped to 79 percent in July, a record high, a Gallup poll found in July. About 62 percent of Americans said they disliked how Trump was handling the issue.</p><p>Despite this, the media operations at DHS show no signs of slowing down. Inside the ICE team, the chats showed, many were proud of their work — and committed for the long haul.</p><p>In August, after an ICE official shared census numbers showing the country’s immigrant population had dropped by 2 million, an ICE legal associate responded simply: “Only 40 million to go.”</p><p>About this story</p><p>Videos from ICEGov/X.

{"details":"<p>Some staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs are finding little to be merry about after the agency said it would eliminate tens of thousands of open, unfilled positions across the country as it looks to streamline its staffing.</p><p>Three sources familiar with the decisions told CNN that leadership at the VA medical facilities they work for first informed them of plans to eliminate the jobs just before Thanksgiving. The positions being eliminated include primary care doctors and nurses, mental health care providers and social workers, among many others.</p><p>On Monday, multiple facilities held town halls discussing further caps on future jobs, one of the sources said, adding that based on what this person heard, the impression was that “more job cuts are coming.”</p><p>The person, who works in management at a VA hospital in the Eastern US, told CNN that when the directives to eliminate several hundred open positions at their facilities were issued, they were given only a few days to figure out which positions to cut.</p><p>The open positions at risk include those at VA hospitals, clinics and so-called Veterans Integrated Service Network offices, or VISNs, which are regional management stations that help deliver services at local VA health care facilities, two sources said.</p><p>Documents from the VA seen by CNN show that the agency is proposing cutting the number of VISNs from 18 to five, though it was unclear when this would be enacted.</p><p>The VA said the cuts are an effort to remove postings for outdated positions that have long been vacant.</p><p>“VA is simply eliminating about 25,000 open and unfilled positions- mostly Covid-era roles that are no longer necessary,” VA Press Secretary Peter Kasperowicz told CNN.</p><p>“All of these positions are unfilled and most have not been filled for more than a year, underscoring how they are no longer needed,” Kasperowicz said, adding that the elimination of those positions would have “zero impact on Veteran care.”</p><p>The VA did not answer CNN’s question of whether it is eliminating VISN offices.</p><p>Sources who spoke to CNN said the cuts have raised alarm as employees are already facing low morale and staffing shortages in many places.</p><p>“The impact on morale is huge. We’ve seen this institution, that so many take pride in working for, being pulled apart,” said one source, a clinician working at a VA facility in the Western US. “It’s hard to watch.” The person said that over half of the 1,000 or so open job positions at their facility are being eliminated.</p><p>“What freaked us out is that we didn’t expect them to cut mental health providers,” another source, a VA management official in mental health, said.</p><p>“We were already short on mental health providers,” the person said, warning that cuts to hiring could impact individual veterans seeking mental health care, such as by leading to longer wait times; not having enough providers or only having less-experienced providers available to see patients, since many experienced mental health care providers have left the VA in recent months.</p><p>The sources say that so far, the plans do not call for people currently occupying VA jobs to be laid off. “They aren’t firing anyone, but all open positions are gone and they may not let us re-fill when people leave,” said one source.</p><p>Another source said that offers had been made to job candidates for some of the open roles at the facility where they work that are now being eliminated. “It’s hard to be merry,” the person said. “It’s just the constant of it. You can’t catch a break.”</p><p>Shortly after President Donald Trump took office in January, the VA made plans to lay off roughly 80,000 employees from a total staff of about 470,000 at the agency, which would have amounted to about 15% of its workforce.</p><p>But in early-July the agency pulled backed plans for mass layoffs, saying instead that it planned to reduce the total number of staffers by about 30,000 “through the federal hiring freeze, deferred resignations, retirements and normal attrition.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The father and son accused of carrying out Australia’s worst terror attack undertook firearms training at an undisclosed location in the countryside, according to a statement of alleged facts released by a magistrate Monday.</p><p>The court document, which contains redactions, includes images from a video of Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed Akram, 24, depicting the pair holding rifles and moving in a way that suggests an element of tactical training.</p><p>“The accused and his father are seen throughout the video firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner,” the document states.</p><p>Fifteen people were killed in the shooting at Bondi Beach on December 14, which authorities said targeted a crowd of Jewish families celebrating Hannukah. Sajid Akram was shot dead by police. His son faces a terror charge and 15 counts of murder, along with 40 of attempted murder.</p><p>The alleged facts state the pair threw four improvised devices at the crowd, moments before they started shooting, though none of them detonated. The document states the three pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb were all viable.</p><p>Images of the IEDs were included in the document, including a fifth suspected bomb placed in the trunk of the vehicle they used to drive to Bondi to carry out the attack.</p><p>The pair are also alleged to have recorded videos in which they shared views suggesting they adhered to “religiously motivated violent extremism ideology.”</p><p>In one video recorded in front of an image of the Islamic State flag, the pair made statements “condemning the acts of Zionists” and appeared to “summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack,” the document added.</p><p>“There is evidence that the Accused and his father… meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,” the document said.</p><p>The document adds to the emerging picture of events leading up to the attack.</p><p>The videos of the men allegedly conducting firearms training in a rural area, believed to be in New South Wales, were allegedly filmed in October. Previously police said they traveled to the Philippines in November, where they stayed for nearly a month and barely left their rooms, a hotel staff member told CNN.</p><p>The document released Monday reveals that the men visited the site of the Bondi Beach attack on December 12.  Closed circuit television showed the men walking along a footbridge near Archer Park, from which they’ve alleged to have shot their victims two days later.</p><p>“Police allege that this is evidence of reconnaissance and planning of a terrorist act,” the court document said.</p><p>In the hours after the shooting police descended on an address on Bonnyrigg, west of Sydney’s city center, where they found two phones, a homemade firearm, a longbow with 12 arrows and a Quran with highlighted passages, the document said.</p><p>The elder man’s wife told police she believed he and her son were away on holiday in southern NSW. The son phoned her every day from a payphone to tell her what they planned to do that day, she said, according to the document.</p><p>It added that the day after the attack, police officers forced open the door of a rented room in Campsie, in southwestern Sydney, where the men were believed to have been staying. There, officers found 3D printed parts for a shotgun speed loader, bomb-making equipment, a long bow with 12 arrows and two copies of the Quran, one with an “earmarked page,” the statement of alleged facts said.</p><p>Riot police guarded Naveed Akram as he was transferred from Royal North Shore Hospital to an unnamed correctional facility on Monday, NSW Police said. He had been receiving “advanced medical treatment” after being shot in the abdomen, according to the court document.</p><p>From his hospital bed, he declined a request for a formal police interview on legal advice, the statement said. His next court date is in April.</p><p>After being booed at a ceremony to mark one week since the terror attack on Sunday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese issued an apology to the Jewish community for what they’d been through.</p><p>“As prime minister, I feel the weight of responsibility for an atrocity that happened whilst I’m prime minister, and I’m sorry for what the Jewish community and our nation as a whole has experienced,” he said Monday.</p><p>On top of new laws targeting hate speech, the federal government announced plans on Monday to create a new aggravated offense for people who radicalize children. Of 33 people currently before the courts, 17 are children, said Attorney General Michelle Rowland.</p><p>“This unprecedented radicalization of our youth must stop,” she said. “We will not allow extremists to groom and brainwash our children into hate or terrorism.”</p><p>So far, Albanese has resisted calls for a federal royal commission –– the country’s highest level of formal inquiry –– from political opponents who say that the government’s plans to review law enforcement and intelligence agencies don’t go far enough.</p><p>In the aftermath of the shooting, state and federal governments have scrambled to propose new gun laws, with the NSW parliament convening an emergency session on Monday to debate capping the number of firearms recreational license holders can have at four.</p><p>Farmers would be limited to 10, provoking criticism from agricultural producers that the new laws are unworkable.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Markets</p><p>Hot Stocks</p><p>Fear & Greed Index</p><p>Latest Market News</p><p>Hot Stocks</p><p>Chinese-made drones have dominated the skies in the United States for years, with private owners, police departments, and firefighters deploying them nationwide. But a new rule by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday will make it impossible for US consumers to buy the next generation of these drones.</p><p>The FCC banned the import and sale of all new drone models and critical equipment made by foreign manufacturers, including the world’s largest drone maker DJI, by adding them into a so-called “Covered List” of entities deemed to “pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.”</p><p>The FCC decision, while excluding models already approved for sale and those currently in use, marks a culmination of years-long efforts to clamp down on Chinese drones, such as those produced by DJI and another major drone maker Autel Robotics.</p><p>DJI has expressed disappointment over the decision, which could also irk many drone users in the country. DJI alone commands about 70% of the global market, according to data from market research firm Research and Markets. Beyond public sector use, Chinese drones have been widely deployed across the US for tasks including infrastructure and construction inspections, crop monitoring, as well as professional and hobbyist videographers.</p><p>In June, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate the commercialization of drone technologies and scale up domestic drone production “against foreign control or exploitation.”</p><p>“President Trump has been clear that his Administration will act to secure our airspace and unleash American drone dominance,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr on X Monday.</p><p>“We do so through an action today that does not disrupt the ongoing use or purchase of previously authorized drones and with appropriate avenues for excluding drones that do not pose a risk,” he added.</p><p>The import, sale or use of existing device models the telecom regulator previously authorized will continue to be allowed and consumers can continue to use any drones previously purchased legally, the FCC said.</p><p>The announcement this week came after the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress last year mandated a security review of equipment produced by DJI, Autel and other foreign drone makers by December 23, 2025.</p><p>Over the past year, DJI has written letters to American officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, welcoming scrutiny and the necessary examinations of its products.</p><p>“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” wrote Adam Welsh, DJI’s Head of Global Policy, in his latest letter earlier this month.</p><p>But instead of a comprehensive examination the industry and DJI had expected, the FCC said its decision was based on a determination by a White House-convened executive branch interagency body that concluded foreign made drones and components “could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over US territory.”</p><p>A DJI spokesperson told CNN Monday that the company is “disappointed” by FCC’s action, saying that “no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”</p><p>The spokesperson reiterated their commitment to the US market and product safety backed by independent reviewers.</p><p>“Concerns about DJI’s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,” the person added.</p><p>CNN has reached out to Autel for comment.</p><p>Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, called the FCC listing “discriminatory” on Tuesday, adding that Beijing opposes Washington’s overgeneralization of national security.</p><p>“The US should correct its erroneous practices and provide a fair, just, and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies to operate,” he said.</p><p>Multiple Chinese companies, including tech and telecom giant Huawei and state-owned telecom firm ZTE, have already been included in the FCC’s Covered List for similar national security risks.</p><p>Concerns about Chinese made drones and DJI are not new. As early as 2017, the US Army banned the use of DJI drones due to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. That same year, the Department of Homeland Security warned in an internal memo that Chinese-made drones might be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China.</p><p>In 2020, DJI was placed on the Commerce Department’s economic blacklist, or so called Entity List, for the company’s alleged involvement in human‑rights abuses and high‑technology surveillance against China’s Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and other minorities. The following year, the US Treasury Department also placed investment restrictions on DJI for similar reasons.</p><p>In 2022, the Department of Defense added DJI onto a list of firms allegedly working with China’s People’s Liberation Army. Although DJI has rejected the Pentagon’s characterization and sued for its removal, it lost the court bid in September this year.</p><p>CNN’s Kloe Zhang contributed to this report.</p><p>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

{"details":"<p>Former neighbors paint a mixed portrait of Claudio Neves Valente, whose motives remain a mystery more than a week after police say he killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor, portraying a “very bright” but reclusive young man who was estranged from his family and whose mother once told a neighbor that her son “needs help.”</p><p>CNN visited the apartment building that Neves Valente, a native of Portugal, lived in as a student more than two decades ago before moving to the United States. The brown, cream and gray high-rise in Olivais, a modest middle-class neighborhood in eastern Lisbon, looks much like others in the area.</p><p>People who knew him there said they remain in shock after US authorities identified Neves Valente as the gunman who shot 11 people at Rhode Island’s Brown University, two of them fatally, on December 13 and mortally wounded a former Portuguese classmate, MIT professor Nuno Loureiro, two days later in Brookline, Massachusetts. On Thursday night, police found Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a storage facility he rented in New Hampshire.</p><p>Residents of his Lisbon neighborhood told CNN the former Ivy League student was extremely smart and polite, but reclusive. At the time he lived there, he was studying at the Instituto Superior Técnico, one of Portugal’s most prestigious engineering schools.</p><p>The institute confirmed to CNN that Neves Valente and Loureiro were both students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in technological physics engineering.</p><p>Maria Margarida Baptista, a neighbor, recalled working with Neves Valente on administrative tasks for the apartment building, duties assigned to residents for up to three years on a rotating basis. “He was always very diligent” with the math and bills, she told CNN. “Everything in the administration was always very well done.” He would always greet her and address her by name, she added. “I really liked him.”</p><p>Friend of gunman in Brown and MIT shootings speaks to CNN: ‘I realize maybe the signs were always there’</p><p>Despite not having seen him for more than 25 years, she said she was stunned by the news of the attack at Brown. “I was in shock,” she said. “I didn’t even recognize him on TV … I remember him as a boy, a student, a teenager. A very responsible teenager.”</p><p>“He was a bit strange,” Baptista said, “but he was a very bright boy.”</p><p>Neighbors say Neves Valente’s reclusiveness extended beyond the community. According to residents, he also avoided contact with his immediate family. His parents would come to visit his apartment, ring the bell, and he wouldn’t open the front door, a woman living nearby who declined to give her name told CNN.</p><p>Neves Valente’s parents would sometimes hide and wait outside the building, hoping to speak with Neves Valente, the woman said.</p><p>“He changed the locks. He knew they were around. He wouldn’t leave the house – it was like he was hiding from them.” She said Neves Valente’s mother often relied on her for information.</p><p>The woman said simply confirming she had seen Neves Valente would bring his mother relief. “She would relax because she knew he was alive,” the neighbor recalled. “All they wanted was to spend time with him, but they never got to see him. He didn’t want to see his parents.”</p><p>Baptista recalled one occasion when the mother, for unknown reasons, feared that something bad had happened to Neves Valente inside the apartment. “The parents came with firefighters and police to break through the windows to check if he was dead,” she said.</p><p>They were eventually able to get inside, but he was not home. Neighbors said Neves Valente was extremely upset when he learned his parents had involved the police.</p><p>The neighbor who declined to be identified recalled a separate occasion when police were called again but did not force entry, stating that Neves Valente was not a minor.</p><p>Later, the mother confided that she feared her son would sell the apartment and disappear – which eventually happened. “That, for the parents, was devastating,” the neighbor said. “That was the last day his mother came here.”</p><p>The neighbor, who said she remains in contact with Neves Valente’s parents, said they had not spoken to their son in years. “The parents … are very gentle people,” she said. “They are doing really badly. Neighbors have been helping them. They are quite old, and the news was devastating.”</p><p>At one point, she recalled, the mother confided without elaborating: “My son needs help, but he doesn’t want to get it.”</p><p>Events leading to the killings of Brown University students and MIT professor spanned decades</p><p>His parents had fostered Neves Valente’s passion for science before he attended university.</p><p>While he was in secondary school some 30 years ago, they persuaded a physics and chemistry teacher, José Morgado, to take their son to Portugal’s physics Olympics in Coimbra, a city about 120 miles north of Lisbon.</p><p>“He wanted to go. And because there wasn’t anyone who would make themselves available to guide him, (his parents) called me to help him, and that’s what I did,” Morgado said.</p><p>Speaking to CNN from Torres Nova, near Neves Valente’s hometown of Entroncamento in central Portugal, Morgado described the former student as brilliant and exceptional, adding that he ended up winning the national event and went on to compete in the international physics Olympics in Australia.</p><p>“I used to say to my colleagues that Claudio was the ‘perfect student.’ During the time I had him as a student, he never deviated from that pattern,” Morgado recalled. “An excellent person with his teachers, his classmates and everyone he interacted with. I never met anyone who said Claudio behaved poorly or wasn’t a good student. In every subject, he performed well.”</p><p>Like others who knew Neves Valente in Portugal, Morgado said he was shocked to learn about the shootings at Brown University and Massachusetts.</p><p>“It was the complete opposite of the image I had of him. Something happened to him that led him to take those actions,” he told CNN. “But him being the perpetrator is something that I just can’t wrap my head around, given the image I have of him. I still think of him as an 18-year-old.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>Yemen’s Houthi rebels and the Saudi-backed Yemeni government have reached a new agreement to carry out a large-scale prisoner exchange, marking a significant humanitarian step amid ongoing efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p><p>Abdulqader Hasan Yahya al-Murtadha, head of the Houthi National Committee for Prisoners’ Affairs, said on Tuesday that the deal includes the release of around 1,700 Houthi detainees in exchange for 1,200 prisoners held by the other side, among them seven Saudi nationals and 23 Sudanese.</p><p>Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen, Mohamed Al-Jabir, said the agreement was signed under the supervision of the United Nations special envoy for Yemen and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In a post on X, Al-Jabir described the agreement as an important confidence-building measure.</p><p>The UN special envoy’s office said in a statement on Tuesday that the agreement was reached at the conclusion of a 12-day meeting in Muscat, Oman.</p><p>The UN special envoy, Hans Grundberg, said the agreement was a “positive and meaningful step that will hopefully ease the suffering of detainees and their families across Yemen.”</p><p>Prisoner exchanges have been one of the few areas where Yemen’s warring sides have made tangible progress. The agreement reached Tuesday will result in the largest prisoner exchange between the two parties so far. In October 2020, more than 1,000 prisoners were released following UN-backed talks in Switzerland. Another major exchange took place in April 2023, when the ICRC facilitated the release and transfer of 973 detainees linked to the conflict.</p><p>Yemen: What you need to know about how we got here</p><p>Yemen’s civil war began in 2014, when Houthi forces seized the capital, Sanaa, ousting the internationally recognized government. The conflict escalated in 2015 after a Saudi-led coalition intervened. Despite years of fighting, the Houthis continue to control large parts of the country. A UN-brokered ceasefire signed in 2022 later expired, but the parties have so far avoided a return to full-scale war, with humanitarian measures such as prisoner exchanges remaining a key channel for dialogue.</p><p>The conflict has resulted in the deaths of around 377,000 people, according to a 2021 report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), more than half of whom died from indirect causes associated with the conflict, such as lack of food, water and health care.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Cricket</p><p>The Ashes</p><p>Ben Duckett in the field at Adelaide Oval Mark Brake - CA/Cricket Australia via Getty Images</p><p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) are working to “establish the facts” after footage emerged on social media of Ben Duckett appearing to be intoxicated on a night out during the Ashes tour.</p><p>Duckett is seen standing alone in the video, posted on X, and being asked if he needs any assistance to return safely to his hotel. It is unclear at this stage when the footage was filmed, or by whom, but during the conversation one of those present states “we’re losing 2-0”, suggesting it was taken between the second Test in Brisbane and the third in Adelaide.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>England enjoyed a four-night break in Noosa in that period between the games, both of which were lost. The men’s team managing director, Rob Key, stood by the trip to the resort on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast when speaking to reporters on Tuesday but indicated the ECB are investigating suggestions that mid-tour break descended into a glorified “stag do”.</p><p>“We are aware of content circulating on social media,” an ECB spokesperson told The Athletic. “We have high expectations for behaviour, accepting that players are often under intense levels of scrutiny, with established processes that we follow when conduct falls below expectations. We also support players that need assistance.</p><p>“We will not comment further at this stage while we establish the facts.”</p><p>Duckett has endured a miserable series in Australia, scoring only 97 runs across six innings to date at an average of 16.16, with a top score of 29. He was dismissed second ball in the second innings at Adelaide as England embarked on a pursuit of what would have constituted a Test record 435 run chase.</p><p>They were bowled out for 352 to lose by 82 runs, in the process surrendering the series 3-0 after only 11 days’ cricket.</p><p>Both the England coach Brendon McCullum and the captain Ben Stokes have since indicated they want to remain in their respective roles after this tour. The mid-series break in Noosa had been incorporated into the schedule a year ago as a bonding exercise for the players on what all concerned had anticipated would be an intense series in Australia.</p><p>“If it goes into where they’re drinking lots and it’s a stag do, all of that type of stuff, that’s completely unacceptable,” said Key of Noosa. “I’m not a drinker. A drinking culture doesn’t help anyone in any stretch whatsoever.</p><p>“Everything that I’ve heard is that they sat down, had lunch, had dinner, didn’t go out late, all of that, had the odd drink — I don’t mind that.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“If it goes past that, then that’s an issue as far as I’m concerned. If there are things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then we’ll be looking into that.</p><p>“From everything that I’ve heard, they actually were pretty well behaved. Very well behaved. I don’t mind players having a glass of wine over dinner. Anything more than that is ridiculous, really.”</p><p>The Athletic has contacted Duckett’s representatives for comment.</p><p>The 31-year-old has been a mainstay of the England side over the last few years and had returned to Australia seeking to make amends after being dropped and banished from the second-string Lions’ tour of the country in 2017-18 after it emerged he had poured a drink over Jimmy Anderson’s head in a bar. That incident took place on the night before he was due to play in a mid-tour warm-up game in Perth for the full side.</p><p>He revealed last year on the Final Word podcast what was widely rumoured at the time — that Anderson had instigated the high jinks that night. “Jimmy actually threw a drink at me, but no one knows about that,” said Duckett. “Then he said: ‘Oh, we’re just messing about, you can just lob one on my head. That’s fine’.

I don’t know,” he said. “I find it hard to talk about because I’m still in my career and you do have to be careful. People still involved were in charge of those conversations.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“But it was a really, really tough time. I remember how I felt back then and compare it to where I am now, and I just know I’ve got to grab this opportunity with both hands. I don’t want to go anywhere. I want to keep getting better. I want to ignore the noise around me. I just want to keep playing for England, keep scoring runs and keep winning games with England.”</p><p>The fourth Test in Melbourne begins on Boxing Day.</p><p>Prior to joining The Athletic as a Senior Writer, Dominic Fifield spent 20 years covering football on The Guardian. The job as a beat reporter took him through spells in the north-east, on Merseyside and, from 2007, back to the capital as London football correspondent, where his time was largely preoccupied with the managerial merry-go-round at Chelsea. He was also fortunate enough to cover the England national team through five major tournaments, from South Africa to Russia.  In 2023 he became a commissioning editor.
