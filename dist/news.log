In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in el-Fasher,” she said. “There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Residents in the city were being subjected to “horrors” the United Nations’ humanitarian chief said.</p><p>The city was “already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, [but] has descended into an even darker hell,” Tom Fletcher told the UN Security Council.</p><p>There were “credible reports of widespread executions after Rapid Support Forces fighters entered the city”, Fletcher said.</p><p>“We cannot hear the screams, but – as we sit here today – the horror is continuing.

The latest war started in April 2023, when tension between the military and RSF exploded into fighting in the capital, Khartoum.

There’s just extreme levels of trauma.”</p><p>In a grim speech to the UN Security Council, Al-Harith Mohamed called the events unfolding in el-Fasher a “genocide by all legal standards and definitions”.</p><p>“Women and girls are attacked in broad daylight,” he said, adding that Sudan is wondering “Where is the Security Council?”</p><p>The Sudanese ambassador called on the UN to condemn the RSF’s actions and designate the group as a “terrorist” organisation, demand the paramilitary group leave el-Fasher, enforce a year-old arms embargo related to the conflict, and sanction any outside forces supporting the RSF.</p><p>Last year, the UN called on countries to stop supplying weapons to parties in the conflict in Sudan.

Andrew has always denied the claims.</p><p>Reacting to the latest developments, Ms Giuffre's family said she \"brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage\". Giuffre took her own life earlier this year.</p><p>In its statement, the Palace said the King \"has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew\".</p><p>As well as the title, the Palace said \"formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease\" on Royal Lodge.</p><p>He will be moved into private accommodation in Sandringham Estate, which is understood to be privately funded by King Charles.</p><p>\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement continued.</p><p>The Palace also expressed its support for victims of \"any and all forms of abuse\".</p><p>Andrew's two adult daughters, Eugenie and Beatrice, will retain their titles as princesses and Andrew is still eighth in line for the throne.</p><p>It is understood that Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.</p><p>Until this month, she kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew voluntarily gave up the usage of the Duke of York title.</p><p>It is understood that the government was consulted on the decision to strip Andrew of his prince title, and made clear it supported the decision.</p><p>Reacting to the news on BBC Question Time, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it sent a \"very powerful message to the victims of grooming and sex offences\".</p><p>\"This is a huge development and a big step for the King to take. I have to say, just, you know, as an initial response, I really support the step that he's taken.\"</p><p>The stripping of Andrew's titles caps off weeks of mounting pressure on the Royal Family.</p><p>The scandal over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was reignited by sexual abuse allegations in Ms Giuffre's memoir.</p><p>While Andrew has always strenuously denied abusing Ms Giuffre, earlier this month, emails from 2011 re-emerged, showing Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship ended.</p><p>Details about Andrew's living arrangements have also come under the spotlight, with fresh questions being asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.</p><p>Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004, after signing a 75-year lease deal the previous year with his landlord, the Crown Estate, which operates as an independent property company.</p><p>The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.</p><p>Last week, more details emerged about how he could afford his mansion, after the lease agreement was revealed.</p><p>The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a lease document seen by BBC News confirms.</p><p>The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.</p><p>In effect, those payments - which totalled more than £8m and were detailed in a National Audit Office report - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease, based on paying in advance a notional rent of £260,000 per year.</p><p>In a separate development, it emerged this week that Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge as part of his daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in 2006 - two months after a US arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for the sexual assault of a minor. Andrew did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>For the Palace, Thursday's announcement is an attempt to draw a line under the scandals surrounding the former Prince Andrew - now simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.</p><p>A recording of the programme was interrupted on Thursday as the news broke.</p><p>The King's brother loses his title of prince and will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.</p><p>Parliamentary committee demands answers about whether the lease arrangements are \"achieving the best value for money\".</p><p>Priests placed garlands of flowers around the necks of the royal couple when they arrived at the west London temple.</p><p>Shaun and Sophie Oceans chatted to King Charles about their cocktail bar on his Staffordshire visit.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Shirley Chung was just a year old when she was adopted by a US family in 1966.</p><p>Born in South Korea, her birthfather was a member of the American military, who returned home soon after Shirley was born. Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.</p><p>\"He abandoned us, is the nicest way I can put it,\" says Shirley, now 61.</p><p>After around a year, Shirley was adopted by a US couple, who took her back to Texas.</p><p>Shirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.</p><p>\"I moved and breathed and got in trouble like many teenage Americans of the 80s. I'm a child of the 80s,\" Shirley says.</p><p>Shirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.</p><p>But then in 2012, her world came crashing down.</p><p>She lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.</p><p>\"I had a little mental breakdown after finding out I wasn't a citizen,\" she says.</p><p>Shirley is not alone. Estimates of how many American adoptees lack citizenship range from 18,000 to 75,000. Some intercountry adoptees may not even know they lack US citizenship.</p><p>Dozens of adoptees have been deported to their countries of birth in recent years, according to the Adoptee Rights Law Center. A man born in South Korea and adopted as a child by an American family - only to be deported to his country of birth because of a criminal record - took his own life in 2017.</p><p>The reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.</p><p>\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"</p><p>\"Well, am I? Am I going to be fine?\"</p><p>Another woman, who requested anonymity for fear of attracting the attention of authorities, was adopted by an American couple from Iran in 1973 when she was two years old.</p><p>Growing up in the US Midwest, she encountered some racism but generally had a happy upbringing.</p><p>\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.</p><p>But that changed when she tried to get a passport at the age of 38 and discovered immigration authorities had lost critical documents that supported her claim to citizenship.</p><p>This has further complicated her feelings surrounding identity.</p><p>\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.</p><p>\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.</p><p>\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"</p><p>For decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.</p><p>The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 made some headway in rectifying this, granting automatic citizenship to international adoptees. But the law only covered future adoptees or those born after February 1983. Those who arrived before then were not granted citizenship, leaving tens of thousands in limbo.</p><p>Advocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.</p><p>Some, like Debbie Principe, whose two adopted children have special needs, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.</p><p>She adopted two children from an orphanage in Romania in the 1990s after watching them on Shame of a Nation - a documentary about the neglect of children in orphanages following the 1989 Romanian Revolution, that sent shockwaves around the world when it aired.</p><p>The most recent rejection of citizenship came in May, and was followed by a notice stating that if the decision was not appealed in 30 days, she would have to turn in her daughter to Homeland Security, she said.</p><p>\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" Ms Principe said.</p><p>Those fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration said \"two million illegal aliens have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and more than 400,000 deportations\".</p><p>While many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.</p><p>In one case, 238 Venezuelans were deported by the US to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They were accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang despite most of them having no criminal records.</p><p>Last month, US officials detained 475 people - more than 300 of them South Korean nationals - who they said were working illegally at Hyundai's battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in Georgia. The workers were taken away in handcuffs and chains to be detained, sparking outrage in their home country.</p><p>Adoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.</p><p>\"When the election results came in, it started to really cascade with requests for help,\" said Greg Luce, an attorney and founder of the Adoptee Rights Law Center, adding he's had more than 275 requests for help.</p><p>The adoptee who arrived from Iran in the 1970s said she has started avoiding certain areas, like her local Iranian supermarket, and shares an app with her friends so they always have access to her location, in case she is \"swept up\".</p><p>\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.</p><p>\"As far as I'm concerned right now, I feel stateless.\"</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Despite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.</p><p>\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.</p><p>\"The applicants have two, three, or four US citizen parents, and are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We're talking about babies and toddlers who were shipped overseas through no fault of their own and lawfully admitted under US policy,\" she added.</p><p>\"These are people who literally were promised that they were going to be Americans when they were two years old.\"</p><p>Shirley wishes she could get the US president into a room, so she and others like her could explain their stories.</p><p>\"I would ask him to please have some compassion. We're not illegal aliens,\" she said.</p><p>\"We were put on planes as little itty-bitty babies. Just please hear our story and please follow through with the promise that America gave each one of the babies that got on those planes: American citizenship.\"</p><p>The president sets the limit at 7,500 for the coming year, a dramatic cut from 125,000.</p><p>Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.</p><p>The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.</p><p>His five-day tour displayed the power of his presidency - but also, at times, that power's limitations.</p><p>In January 2023, school teacher Abigail Zwerner was shot by her six-year-old student.

In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in el-Fasher,” she said. “There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Residents in the city were being subjected to “horrors” the United Nations’ humanitarian chief said.</p><p>The city was “already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, [but] has descended into an even darker hell,” Tom Fletcher told the UN Security Council.</p><p>There were “credible reports of widespread executions after Rapid Support Forces fighters entered the city”, Fletcher said.</p><p>“We cannot hear the screams, but – as we sit here today – the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people [are] being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>For 18 months before Sudan’s army withdrew from the city, an RSF siege had trapped hundreds of thousands of people inside without food or essentials.</p><p>More than 36,000 people have fled since Saturday, largely on foot, to Tawila, a town around 70km (43 miles) west that is already sheltering roughly 650,000 displaced people.</p><p>“There was a lot of shelling,” Fatima Abdulrahman, a woman displaced from el-Fasher, told Al Jazeera from Tawila. “I myself have been affected by shells. Shelling killed my daughter, injured my other daughter’s eye and paralysed my son. My body is full of wounds and is swollen.”</p><p>The fall of el-Fasher to the RSF could herald another split of Sudan, more than a decade after South Sudan’s creation. The latest war started in April 2023, when tension between the military and RSF exploded into fighting in the capital, Khartoum. The ensuing conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 12 million.</p><p>“What is happening in the city of el-Fasher is not an isolated incident,” Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed, Sudan’s ambassador to the UN, told the Security Council. “Rather, it is a continuation of a systematic pattern of killing and ethnic cleansing that this militia has carried out since its rebellion in April 2023.”</p><p>More than 300 Colombians have been fighting in Sudan’s war.

The numbers of displaced people here, it’s just absolutely astounding. There’s just extreme levels of trauma.”</p><p>In a grim speech to the UN Security Council, Al-Harith Mohamed called the events unfolding in el-Fasher a “genocide by all legal standards and definitions”.</p><p>“Women and girls are attacked in broad daylight,” he said, adding that Sudan is wondering “Where is the Security Council?”</p><p>The Sudanese ambassador called on the UN to condemn the RSF’s actions and designate the group as a “terrorist” organisation, demand the paramilitary group leave el-Fasher, enforce a year-old arms embargo related to the conflict, and sanction any outside forces supporting the RSF.</p><p>Last year, the UN called on countries to stop supplying weapons to parties in the conflict in Sudan.

The philosophy of consumption policy also seems to have shifted from almost supply-centric to supply-and-demand balanced,\" Citi analysts said in a note.</p><p>Structural imbalances have certainly deepened amid China's property market crisis and a trade war with Washington.</p><p>This week, the Communist Party leadership pledged to \"reasonably raise the proportion of public service expenditure in fiscal spending to enhance residents' consumption capacity.\"</p><p>They pledged to step up consumer-focused policies, improve income distribution to boost household income, and increase the central government's share of social spending to better support households.</p><p>\"China's next five-year plan will give more prominence to households and consumption than ever before,\" Andrew Batson, China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, said.</p><p>The five-year plan recommendations reaffirmed last week's official remarks that China will increase the proportion of government investment for people's livelihoods and raise the percentage of household consumption of GDP \"significantly\" over the next five years.</p><p>\"The allocation of resources will shift more towards consumption, as large-scale expansion of traditional industries and infrastructure has reached its limit,\" said a policy adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Future investment will focus on high-tech industries and new infrastructure.\"</p><p>China may aim to increase the household consumption rate by about 5 percentage points over the next five years, but policy advisers say it is unclear whether the government will set a specific target in the upcoming five-year plan.</p><p>Attempts to boost consumption and related reforms over the past decade have been slow to take root in the real economy. Consumer confidence has remained low because of inadequate social welfare, slowing income growth and a property crisis that has eroded household wealth. The services sector has also taken time to develop.</p><p>Currently, household consumption accounts for about 40% of GDP, far below nearly 70% in the United States. Some government advisers suggest China should aim for a consumption rate of 50% within the next decade.</p><p>\"The key to boosting domestic consumption is resource distribution,\" ANZ analysts said in a note.</p><p>Analysts and investors are watching for measures that redirect funds and resources from businesses and government investment to households, which will be crucial for unlocking consumer demand.</p><p>Alongside the consumption focus, the leadership reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a reasonable manufacturing share in the economy, prioritising emerging industries such as new energy, aerospace and advanced materials. Manufacturing accounts for around a quarter of GDP.</p><p>China unveiled its outline for policy goals for 2026-2030 last week, prioritising manufacturing and technology reliance while also pledging to boost consumption.</p><p>The full five-year plan, with detailed economic targets, will be released at the annual parliament meeting in March.</p><p>Capital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard said that fiscal policy will be key to boosting consumption, and the share of fiscal spending on investment - now at a three-decade high - could decline in the coming years.</p><p>The government spends over 6% of GDP annually on investment, excluding significant funding from quasi-fiscal agencies like local government financing vehicles and policy banks, he said.</p><p>\"But the wider policy agenda will limit how quickly this happens, and it will take a long time for the imbalances in China's economy to be fully addressed,\" he said.</p><p>Of the 1.3 trillion yuan ($182.5 billion) in ultra-long special treasury bonds planned for this year, 300 billion yuan will be allocated to support a consumer goods trade-in scheme, with the rest for equipment upgrades and investment projects.</p><p>President Xi Jinping, in remarks published on Tuesday, underscored the focus on boosting consumption, citing \"increasing downward pressure on the economy and insufficient effective demand.\"</p><p>China's economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in a year in the third quarter as soft domestic demand left it reliant on exports amid U.S. tariffs. Economists are increasingly calling for social welfare and other reforms to address supply-demand imbalances and persistent deflation.</p><p>\"Whenever we face international economic instability, we always rely on the domestic economy to respond to 'black swan' events,\" Yang Ping, head of the investment institute of the National Development and Reform Commission, the state planner, told reporters on Monday.</p><p>\"We will promote a significant increase in the consumption rate through income distribution reform and other measures.\"</p><p>($1 = 7.1230 Chinese yuan)</p>","headline":"China signals sharper pivot to consumption as imbalances worsen","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-signals-sharper-pivot-consumption-imbalances-worsen-2025-10-30/","message":""}

His brother, Idan, was killed in the attack. Three months into Sahar’s captivity, the Israeli military said he was killed during an attempted rescue mission. He was 25.</p><p>Cooper was an economist and one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was captured along with his wife, Nurit, who was released after 17 days. In June 2024, Israeli officials confirmed that he had been killed in Gaza. He was 84.</p><p>So far, Hamas has now returned the remains of 17 hostages since the start of the ceasefire, with 11 others still in Gaza and set to be turned over under the terms of the agreement.</p><p>In return, Israel has returned the bodies of 195 Palestinians to authorities in Gaza without providing details on their identities. It is unclear if they were killed in Israel during the 7 October attack, died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.</p><p>Health officials in Gaza say they have struggled to identify the bodies without access to DNA kits.</p><p>Meanwhile, officials in southern Gaza said Thursday that at least 40 people had been injured in overnight strikes, after Israel declared the ceasefire was back on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Mohammad Saar, head of the nursing department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, said it received 40 people wounded in overnight strikes on Khan Younis.</p><p>The Israeli army said it carried out strikes on “terrorist infrastructure that posed a threat to the troops” in Khan Younis. The area in southern Gaza is under the control of the Israeli military.</p><p>Israel claimed it was retaliating for the shooting and death of one of its soldiers in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, following strikes earlier this week that killed over 100 people.</p><p>According to Netanyahu, Hamas had broken the agreement's clause pertaining to the return of hostage remains.</p><p></p><p>Hamas denied any involvement in the deadly shooting and, in turn, accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal.</p><p>“If Hamas continues to blatantly violate the ceasefire, it will experience powerful strikes, as it did the day before yesterday and yesterday,” Netanyahu said Thursday during a graduation ceremony for military commanders in southern Israel.</p><p>He vowed Israel would “act as needed” to remove “immediate danger” to its forces.</p><p>“At the end of the day, Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised. If foreign forces do this, all the better. And if they don’t, we will do it.”</p><p>Reports say the guarantors of the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza told Hamas that Israel will begin military operations on targets inside the Israeli-occupied zone of the Palestinian territory and that they will not protest after a deadline for militants to leave the area expired Thursday.</p><p>The ceasefire, which went into effect on 10 October, aims to end the war triggered by the 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants, who killed about 1,200 people, sparking an Israeli onslaught that killed over 65,000 Palestinians, — a conflict that's by far the bloodiest and most damaging of all time between both sides.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Israel receives remains of two more hostages returned by Hamas","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/10/31/israel-receives-remains-of-two-more-hostages-returned-by-hamas","message":""}
{"details":"<p>Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, are gathering in South Korea for a major summit Friday. But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.</p><p>The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his landmark meeting with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to de-escalate the protracted trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies.</p><p>With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi steps into the limelight and will hold high-profile meetings, including with Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi and Canada’s Mark Carney.</p><p>Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs loom over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is standing in for Trump during the discussions.</p><p>In his opening remarks to the forum, Xi called for unity and cooperation between the grouping of 21 economies on both sides of the Pacific.</p><p>“The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”</p><p>“China’s door to openness will not close; it will only open wider,” Xi said.</p><p>Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year is on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.</p><p>“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “As the free trade order undergoes dramatic changes, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and trade and investment are losing momentum.”</p><p>Lee said that “only cooperation and solidarity can surely lead us to a better future.”</p><p>Trump’s three-leg tour of Asia, which stopped in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, was generally regarded as a success for all parties, with Asian leaders putting on a masterclass in hospitality and flattery as they sought to get the president on side — and ease trade negotiations in the process.</p><p>Trump’s meeting with Xi ended in a trade agreement that called for the US to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay some export controls on rare earths and resume purchases of American soybeans.</p><p>In Japan, Trump and freshly appointed Prime Minister Takaichi embarked on a “new golden age” of relations and signed a critical minerals agreement. And a new trade deal reached with Lee would see South Korea invest billions of dollars in the US, including in shipbuilding, aerospace and technology, according to the White House.</p><p>On Friday, Xi is expected to hold talks with Japan’s Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. Takaichi faces a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing mounting economic woes.</p><p>Xi is also expected to meet Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.</p><p>In comments that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”</p><p>“Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”</p><p>Canada, he said, was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

The US, China, and Iran all signed but have not ratified the original treaty, while Russia withdrew its ratification in 2023.</p><p>Moscow carried out its last nuclear test in 1990 while still the Soviet Union, and China carried out its last nuclear test in 1996, according to the UN. The last nuclear test by the United Kingdom was in 1991, followed by the US in 1992 and France in 1996. North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear tests in the past two decades, with its last test in 2017.</p><p>Trevor Findlay, a nuclear security expert and honorary professional fellow at the University of Melbourne, told Al Jazeera that it was unclear what type of testing Trump was referring to in his post.</p><p>“My assumption is that he means missile launches of nuclear-capable missiles, as North Korea and Russia have been doing very publicly. These do not carry an actual nuclear warhead [but likely a dummy], nor do they create a nuclear explosion,” he said.</p><p>“The US already tests its own missiles periodically, both existing ones and ones in development, often splashing down in the Pacific. It does announce them but tends not to make a big deal of it, like North Korea and Russia,” he said.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has called for the “total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme and says he does not want Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon. In June, the US and Israel also carried out air strikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities in part to slow its progress.</p><p>Tehran has maintained that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only, and it has never carried out a nuclear test, according to the Carnegie Endowment’s Panda.</p><p>“Iran has never done any nuclear tests. They’ve constantly been saying they are not intending to make a nuclear bomb,” Panda told Al Jazeera. “The only thing that Iran has which might be taken seriously is some highly enriched uranium. That’s it. They have not even tested a nuclear ballistic missile.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Iran condemns Trump’s call to resume US nuclear testing","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/iran-condemns-trumps-call-to-resume-us-nuclear-testing","message":""}

And following this logic, the Balkans should belong to Russia’s sphere.”</p><p>“Trump is very much interested in authoritarianism. In Europe, he likes ‘strongmen’ like Orban or (Slovak PM Robert) Fico,” Bindenagel said.</p><p>Trump accepts the argument that EU enlargement strengthens Europe and weakens Russian President Vladimir Putin, he added. “But here’s the point: Trump doesn’t want to weaken Putin.”</p><p>The only place where EU enlargement got somewhat special attention from the Trump administration is Ukraine.</p><p>The candidate country against which Russia unleashed a full-scale war more than three years ago is still fighting for its very survival as an independent country.</p><p>While he has acknowledged Ukraine’s strategic importance and its European orientation, Trump has not publicly laid out a position specifically stating whether he supports or opposes Ukraine’s membership in the EU.</p><p>Still, a report by Bloomberg published in August suggested President Trump raised the issue of Ukraine's membership with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and asked about the reason behind his opposition to Kyiv's candidacy.</p><p>What is clear from his statements is that he is against Ukraine joining NATO.</p><p>“You (Ukraine) can forget about NATO,” Trump said at a cabinet meeting in February. “I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started.”</p><p>With the doors to NATO shut, Ukrainians could see joining the EU as an important “consolation prize” still relevant in the context of security guarantees.</p><p>Deepening their security ties to EU members could indeed strengthen Ukraine’s ability to push back against Moscow’s imperialist project, Lokker said.</p><p>“The Kremlin will need to think twice about attacking a country protected by the bloc’s mutual defense clause, especially given the massive rearmament now underway within the European Union,” he added.</p><p>Helping to advance Ukrainian membership may be an attractive way for Washington to satisfy Kyiv’s persistent demands for security guarantees while simultaneously reducing its own share of the burden of European security.</p><p>“It would make sense from Trump’s perspective,” Lokker said.</p><p>As the largest accession country - and with the US now holding a significant economic stake in its mineral sector - Ukraine’s economic success would bring substantial benefits to Washington.</p><p>But realising this potential will require a massive post-war reconstruction effort.</p><p>Advancing Ukraine’s EU integration would support that effort by unlocking significant funding to help transform its economy.</p><p>Does that convince the US president? Not clear.</p><p>According to Bindenagel, Trump sees Ukraine as part of a war with Russia that he desperately wants to end – but only to be celebrated as a peacemaker later on.</p><p>“Therefore, he wants Russia to stop the war, but doesn’t want to do anything about it.”</p><p>The failed US-Russian summit in Alaska in the summer as well as the overhyped Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest that was eventually scrapped are a testament to that.</p><p>“Trump is hard to read on this, because he doesn’t have a clear strategy,” Lokker said. “Just look at all the reversals on Ukraine since he took office.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Spoiler or supporter?

Yonhap via REUTERS Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>GYEONGJU, Oct 31 (Reuters) - China's Xi Jinping took centre stage at an annual gathering of Pacific Rim leaders in South Korea on Friday, expected to hold talks with Canadian, Japanese and Thai counterparts after securing a fragile trade truce with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>That agreement, struck just before Trump left South Korea, skipping the main two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, will suspend further curbs on China's exports of rare earths that threatened to jam up global supply chains.</p><p>Bolstering supply chains and reducing trade barriers is a key focus of the talks, hosted in the historic town of Gyeongju. Yet decisions made at the 21-member economic club are non-binding and finding consensus has become increasingly difficult due to geopolitical strains.</p><p>\"Changes unseen in a century are accelerating across the world,\" Xi told the assembled leaders at the closed-door opening session on Friday morning, according to China's foreign ministry.</p><p>\"The rougher the seas, the more we must pull together,\" Xi added, in a speech calling for protection of the multilateral trading system and deeper economic cooperation.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, standing in for Trump, said Washington was \"rebalancing its trade relationships to build a stronger foundation for global growth\", according to remarks released by his department.</p><p>The IMF initially cut the global growth outlook after Trump's April barrage of trade tariffs, but has edged it back up as shocks and financial conditions have proved more benign than expected.</p><p>With the leader of the world's biggest economy absent, attention turns to Xi, who is expected to hold his first talks with Japan's newly elected leader Sanae Takaichi.</p><p>The leaders are expected to hold talks on Friday, sources familiar with the matter said. Before she departed for the summit on Thursday, Takaichi told reporters that arrangements were underway to meet Xi.</p><p>While relations between the historic rivals have been on a sounder footing in recent years, Takaichi's surprise elevation to become Japan's first female leader may strain ties due to her nationalistic views and hawkish security policies.</p><p>One of her first acts since taking office last week was to accelerate a military build-up aimed at deterring the territorial ambitions of an increasingly assertive China in East Asia. Japan also hosts the biggest concentration of U.S. military abroad.</p><p>The detention of Japanese nationals in China and Beijing's import restrictions on Japanese beef, seafood and agricultural products are also likely to be among sensitive issues on the agenda.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet Xi at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), his office said, aiming to restart broad engagement with China after years of poor relations.</p><p>Embroiled in a bitter trade dispute with the United States, Canada's biggest trading partner, Carney told a gathering of executives running parallel to the main summit on Friday that Ottawa aimed to double its non-U.S. exports over the next decade.</p><p>China is Canada's second-biggest trading partner.</p><p>Under the leadership of Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau, Canadians were detained and executed by the Chinese government and Canada's security authorities concluded that China interfered in at least two federal elections. Xi also publicly scolded Trudeau, alleging he leaked their discussions to the press.</p><p>China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Senior officials from both sides met to discuss those issues earlier this month but gave no indication of any looming breakthrough.</p><p>Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is also due to meet Xi in the afternoon, Bangkok said, fresh from signing an enhanced ceasefire deal with neighbouring Cambodia on Sunday overseen by Trump.</p><p>The U.S. president has repeatedly touted himself as a global peace broker. Xi told Trump on Thursday that China also played a major role in advocating for dialogue and reconciliation on various pressing matters.</p><p>South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said on Thursday that he was hopeful leaders would issue a joint declaration when the summit concludes on Saturday.</p><p>Two APEC member nation diplomats privately expressed scepticism that any statement would be particularly substantive given fractures in global politics. APEC failed to adopt a joint declaration in 2018 and 2019, during Trump's first presidency.</p><p>The APEC region, which stretches from Russia to Chile, accounts for 50% of global trade and 61% of GDP.</p><p>Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang will be speaking this afternoon at the business gathering.</p><p>Huang has had a whirlwind week, with Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab becoming the first company to surpass a $5 trillion valuation but the issue of the U.S. chipmaker's sale of advanced AI chips in China was seemingly left out of Thursday's Xi-Trump summit.</p>","headline":"Xi set to meet Canadian, Japanese leaders after Trump trade truce","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-meet-canadian-japanese-leaders-after-trump-trade-truce-2025-10-31/","message":""}

She hugs her mother and is taken into court.</p><p>Diana has already spent 13 days in jail for \"organising a mass public gathering of citizens resulting in a violation of public order\".</p><p>But the charges keep coming.</p><p>The \"mass gathering\" was an improvised street concert which the authorities claim obstructed pedestrian access to a Metro station.</p><p>Diana Loginova is a music student and, under the name Naoko, lead singer with the band Stoptime.</p><p>On the streets of St Petersburg, Stoptime have been performing songs by exiled Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka, singer-songwriters fiercely critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p><p>Many of these prominent musicians, now abroad, have been officially designated foreign agents by Russian authorities.</p><p>Videos posted online show that Stoptime's street concerts have been attracting quite a crowd, with dozens of mainly young people singing along and dancing to the music.</p><p>Whilst it is not forbidden in Russia to sing or play songs by foreign agents, in May a Russian court banned Noize MC's track Swan Lake Cooperative, claiming it contained \"propaganda for the violent change of the constitutional order\".</p><p>Swan Lake is seen by many as a symbol of political change in Russia.</p><p>In the USSR, Soviet TV often showed the ballet following the death of Soviet leaders, and it was back on Soviet TV screens in 1991 during the failed coup by communist hardliners. Lake (Ozero in Russian) is also the name of a dacha co-operative widely associated with President Putin's inner circle.</p><p>A video clip of Stoptime performing the song went viral recently on social media.</p><p>Diana Loginova was detained on 15 October. Police also arrested her boyfriend, guitarist Alexander Orlov, and drummer, Vladislav Leontyev.</p><p>The three band members were sentenced to between 12 and 13 days behind bars.</p><p>In Courtroom 11 Diana is facing an additional charge: discrediting the Russian armed forces. It relates to one of the songs she sang: You're a Soldier by (\"foreign agent\") Monetochka.</p><p>\"You're a soldier,\" begins the chorus.</p><p>\"And whatever war you are fighting,</p><p>\"I'm sorry, I'll be on the other side.\"</p><p>After a brief hearing the judge finds Diana guilty of discrediting Russia's army and fines her 30,000 roubles (£285).</p><p>But she is not free to go. The police take Diana back to the police station and prepare more charges.</p><p>The next day she and her boyfriend Alexander are brought to Smolninsky District Court. I manage to have a word with them before they enter the courtroom.</p><p>\"I'm very pleased, and it's important, that people have been supporting us, that many people are on our side, on the side of truth,\" Diana tells me.</p><p>\"I'm surprised by how things have been exaggerated. We've been accused of lots of things we didn't do. All we were doing was bringing the music we like to a mass audience. The power of music is very important. What's happening now proves that.\"</p><p>\"I think it's not the words, it's the music that is most important,\" guitarist Alexander Orlov tells me. \"Music says everything for people. It always has.\"</p><p>Alexander reveals he proposed to Diana when the police van they were being transported in stopped at a petrol station.</p><p>\"I made a ring out of a tissue,\" he tells me. \"I had time to get on my knees, and she said yes.\"</p><p>\"We hope we'll be back home soon,\" says Diana. \"That's what we're dreaming of most.\"</p><p>They won't be going home yet. At this latest court hearing the judge sends Diana and Alexander back to jail for another 13 days for more public order offences.</p><p>Civil society in Russia is under intense pressure. Yet supporters of Diana Loginova and Stoptime are trying to make their voices heard.</p><p>\"I was on the street when Diana was singing and people were singing along so beautifully,\" says Alla outside the courthouse. \"For me it was important to be here to support Diana and show her some people do care. This should not be happening.\"</p><p>To another of Diana's supporters I suggest that, in Russia now, displaying solidarity for anyone accused of discrediting the Russian army requires a degree of courage.</p><p>\"It's people like Diana who are the brave ones,\" says Sasha. \"We're cowards. Some people are heroes. Others just follow behind.\"</p><p>\"Some people [in Russia] are scared,\" continues Sasha. \"But others here do support the authorities and what's going on. Unfortunately, I know people like this. It came as a blow when I discovered that people I've been friends with for 40 years support what's happening. For years they've been watching Russian TV. I haven't.\"</p><p>In the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Mikhailov expressed his solidarity through music. The street musician performed songs in support of Diana Loginova. He was detained and jailed for 14 days for \"petty hooliganism\".</p><p>Despite the crackdown, young street musicians in St Petersburg continue to perform music by artists labelled foreign agents by Russian authorities.</p><p>It's a chilly autumn evening. But passers-by have stopped to listen to a teenage band outside a St Petersburg Metro station. Among the songs they're performing are compositions by \"foreign agents\" Noize MC and Morgenshtern.</p><p>Suddenly the police turn up. The concert is over.</p><p>I look on as three band members are taken away in a police car.</p><p>I go to meet someone else in St Petersburg accused of \"discreditation\".</p><p>Ludmila Vasilyeva, 84, was born two months before Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union.</p><p>She survived the Nazi siege of Leningrad (then the name for St Petersburg) and has carried with her all her life how devastating war can be.</p><p>So, when Vladimir Putin ordered a mass invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ludmila was deeply shocked.</p><p>Earlier this year, on the third anniversary of Russia's \"special military operation\", Ludmila went on to the street to express her anti-war stance.</p><p>\"I wrote on my placard: 'People! Let's stop the war. We bear responsibility for peace on Planet Earth!'\"</p><p>Following her personal protest Ludmila received a letter from the police instructing her to report to the police station.</p><p>\"They told me that I had discredited our soldiers. How? By calling for peace? I let them know that everything I'd wanted to say I'd already made quite clear on my placard and that I wouldn't be going down to the station. They threatened to take me to court. And in the end that's what they did.\"</p><p>Ludmila was fined 10,000 roubles (£95) for \"discrediting the Russian armed forces\".</p><p>She has no regrets and seemingly, despite the growing repression around her, no fear.</p><p>\"Why should I be scared?\" Ludmila asks me. \"Of what and of whom should I be frightened? I'm not scared of anyone. I speak the truth. And they know that.\"</p><p>She believes that increasing authoritarianism stems from those in power fearing the public.</p><p>\"People are scared. But [the authorities] are more scared. That's why they're tightening the screws.\"</p><p>Ludmila Vasilyeva's outspokenness is an exception, not the rule. Today few Russians engage in public protest. I ask Ludmila why that is: is it fear, indifference, or because of support for the authorities?</p><p>\"Most people are focused on their own lives, on just surviving,\" Ludmila replies.</p><p>But she claims that when she speaks her mind publicly many people agree with her.</p><p>\"When I go to the shops, I always strike up a conversation. No one has ever sneaked on me or put in a complaint about me.</p><p>\"Once I was saying something down at the post office. Someone turned to me and said: 'Quiet, keep it down.' I replied: 'Why should I be quiet? What I'm saying, isn't it the truth? Truth must be spoken loudly.'\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees.</p><p>\"When I was standing with my placard and talking to a policeman, a man in his 50s came up to us. He leant forward and said: 'Just strangle her.'\"</p><p>The capture of Pokrovsk could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the Donetsk region.</p><p>It is necessary for the US to keep pace with weapons programmes in China and Russia, the president says.</p><p>At least 32 others were injured in the attack, including six children, the city's mayor says.</p><p>The experimental weapon is hailed as having a potentially unlimited range  - though Western experts have questioned its value.</p><p>The story of a dramatic and heroic rescue that has captured the public imagination in Ukraine.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>As President Donald Trump danced on the tarmac in Malaysia, met Japan’s emperor in Tokyo, and accepted a gold crown in South Korea, one key question kept following him – would he hold a surprise meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un?</p><p>On several occasions Trump made public overtures that he’d “love” to meet Kim while in the region. It could have been a made-for-TV sequel to his surprise 2019 visit at the demilitarized zone (DMZ), when Trump made history as the first sitting US president to step foot on North Korean soil.</p><p>In the end it never came together. And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.</p><p>There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.</p><p>American filmmaker and manager at Young Pioneer Tours Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.</p><p>He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.</p><p>“They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”</p><p>Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”</p><p>That matter-of-fact indifference marks a striking change from 2018 and 2019, when Trump’s summits with Kim — first in Singapore, then in Hanoi, and later at the DMZ — gripped both capitals and dominated global headlines.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025 and Trump’s overtures barely registered. But there’s good reason for that.</p><p>Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and historic show of unity against the West.</p><p>Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine.</p><p>Frankly, a handshake with the US president no longer carries the weight it once did.</p><p>Trump said the missed meeting with Kim was “a matter of timing.”</p><p>“We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.</p><p>North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a meeting with Putin to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.</p><p>That made it logistically impossible for North Korea’s top diplomat to help arrange any last-minute meeting between Kim and Trump as she did in 2019, when Choe helped pull together the DMZ meeting just hours after Trump posted on social media he wanted to meet Kim.</p><p>Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.</p><p>But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.</p><p>Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its “absurd obsession” with denuclearization. In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”</p><p>In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.</p><p>What Martell saw in Pyongyang underscores why.</p><p>The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.</p><p>Even South Korea’s President Lee seems to recognize the challenges in bringing Kim to the table.</p><p>In an interview with me this week, Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”</p><p>Martell had not been to Pyongyang since 2017. The capital’s development over the past eight years, despite sanctions and the extreme isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, stunned him.</p><p>“It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”</p><p>He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.</p><p>“What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.</p><p>Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.</p><p>Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.</p><p>Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth. Traveling two hours north to Mount Myohyang, he noticed new housing under construction. “For farmers, too,” he said.</p><p>Despite sanctions, he said, “the DPRK seems to be in a much different position than it was ten years ago.”</p><p>At a national gallery near Kim Il Sung Square, he saw new murals commemorating 80 years of the Workers’ Party. Toward the end, one section vividly depicted North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia.</p><p>“Large North Korean-style murals of soldiers fighting Ukrainians — and winning,” he said.</p><p>Even North Korean cinema has evolved. At the Pyongyang International Film Festival, Martell watched Days and Nights of Confrontation, a new state-produced thriller dramatizing a real-life plot to assassinate Kim Jong Il.</p><p>The film featured violence, modern production values, and even brief nudity — all unheard-of in North Korean films. “A character getting suffocated with a plastic bag — that’s something I’ve certainly never seen in a DPRK movie,” he said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name.</p><p>Despite the silence around Trump’s latest Asia visit, he has not been erased from Pyongyang’s official memory.</p><p>Martell’s group was the first Western delegation in years to visit the International Friendship Exhibition, a sprawling mountainside museum that displays gifts and artifacts from foreign dignitaries. Taking photos inside the exhibition is strictly forbidden.</p><p>“In the section devoted to Kim Jong Un, there were the expected photos — Putin, Lavrov, Xi Jinping, Dennis Rodman,” Martell said. “And President Trump was still there, displayed very prominently.”</p><p>Based on my experiences traveling to the country, if the door were truly closed to future dialogue, that photo would probably have been removed.</p><p>“It’s still displayed very much front and center,” Martell said.</p><p>And Trump has indicated he still wants to meet Kim when he next comes to Asia. “We’ll have other visits, and we’ll work very hard with Kim Jong Un and with everybody on getting things straightened out,” he told reporters on Wednesday.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>An audacious heist at the Louvre saw thieves make off with priceless crown jewels in broad daylight – here is how a decades-old geometry problem can help museums boost their security.</p><p>It took just eight minutes. In those 480 seconds, thieves trundled their way upwards on a mechanical platform to reach a first floor balcony of the Louvre museum in Paris before cutting their way through a window in broad daylight. Once inside, they broke into two glass display cases and then escaped with eight priceless Napoleonic-era crown jewels. It was a \"daring heist\" that has shaken France to its core.</p><p>Seven suspects have now been arrested over the theft. One of the lingering questions that has dogged the robbery investigation, however, is why the thieves were not spotted sooner.</p><p>At a hearing in front of the French Senate in the immediate aftermath of the robbery, Laurence des Cars, the director of the world famous museum, admitted that the museum had \"failed to protect\" the crown jewels. She admitted that the only camera covering the balcony the thieves used was facing the wrong way and a preliminary report revealed one in three rooms in the Denon wing where the thieves struck had no security cameras. More generally Des Cars acknowledged that cuts in surveillance and security staff had left the museum vulnerable and insisted that the Louvre's security system must be reinforced to \"look everywhere\".</p><p>Alarms at the museum apparently sounded as they should, according to the French culture ministry. Yet it is the third high profile theft from French museums in two months, which have left the ministry implementing new security plans across France.</p><p>While there's no doubt that modern museum security is a complex and expensive affair, there is also an intriguing 50-year-old mathematical problem that deals with this very issue.</p><p>It asks, what’s the minimum number of guards – or equivalently 360-degree CCTV cameras – needed in order to keep a whole museum under observation? It is known as the museum problem, or the art gallery problem. The solution is an elegant one.</p><p>We'll assume that all the walls of our imaginary museum are straight lines so that the floorplan is what mathematicians call a polygon, a shape with hard edges and corners. The cameras must be at fixed positions, but they can see in all directions. To ensure the whole museum is covered, we should be able to draw a straight line from any point in the floor plan to at least one of the cameras.</p><p>Take the hexagon-shaped gallery on the left of the diagram below. No matter where you place the camera, you'll be able to see floor and walls of the entire space. When every position can be seen from every other in this way, we call the gallery shape a convex polygon. The L-shaped gallery in the middle is non-convex, which means you're limited in your camera placement, but we can still find spots from where a single camera can see all of the gallery. A Z-shaped gallery needs two cameras to cover it – there are always spots that one camera alone will miss.</p><p>For more interesting floorplans (check out the unusual 15-sided floorplan below) it's far harder to know how many cameras will be needed or where they should be placed. Fortunately for cash-strapped museum directors, Hungarian graph theorist Václav Chvátal solved the museum problem in general terms soon after it was posed in 1973.</p><p>The answer, it turns out, depends on the number of corners (or, as mathematicians call them, \"vertices\"), as there will be as many walls as there are corners in a room. Some simple division helps us work out how many cameras are needed.</p><p>By dividing the number of corners in a room by three, that will tell us how many cameras are needed to cover it, assuming they have a full 360 degree field of view. This works even for complex shapes like our weird, 15-sided gallery below. In this case there are 15 corners, so 15 divided by three equals five.</p><p>This even works if the number of corners isn't neatly divisible by three. For a 20-sided gallery, for example, the answer works out at six and two thirds. In these cases you can take the whole number – so we'd never need more than six cameras in a 20-sided room.</p><p>In 1978 Steve Fisk, a mathematics professor at Bowdoin college in Maine, US, came up with a proof – considered one of the most elegant in all of mathematics – of this lower limit on the number of cameras needed.</p><p>His strategy was to divide the gallery up into triangles (check out the left image of the figure below). He then proved that you can pick just three colours – say red, yellow and blue – and assign a different colour to the corners of each triangle. This would mean that every triangle in your gallery has a different colour in its three corners (See the right image of the figure below for an example). This is known as \"three-colouring\" the corners.</p><p>Triangles are one of those \"convex\" polygons we mentioned earlier, so a camera positioned at any corner (or indeed anywhere in the triangle) can see every point in that shape. Every triangle has corners with each of the three colours. That means you can pick just one of the colours and place cameras at those positions. Those cameras will be able to see every part of every triangle, and hence every part of the gallery. But here's the best part.</p><p>The beauty of Fisk's proof is you can just choose the colour with the fewest dots, and you'll still cover the whole gallery. In the 15-sided shape above, by choosing the red dots, we can get away with only four cameras.</p><p>In fact, the red dot in the top left isn't necessary, because the next red camera can cover its entire surveillance space. So we could even get away with three cameras for this gallery. This is particularly true if we were fitting modern omnidirectional cameras, rather than the old school, wide-angle CCTV feeds that would need to sweep across an area to provide full coverage, creating temporary blind spots.</p><p>But, it's worth remembering that many traditional museums like the Louvre have mostly rectangular rooms. Fortunately, a variant of the art gallery problem shows that when walls meet at right angles, we only need one camera to cover the whole room.</p><p>In her testimony, Des Cars also acknowledged that the Louvre’s perimeter cameras do not cover all external walls. \"We did not spot the arrival of the thieves early enough... the weakness of our perimeter protection is known,\" she said.</p><p>Fortunately, there are versions of the problem, known as \"the fortress problem\" or \"the prison problem\", that solve the camera coverage issue for the exterior of a building too.</p><p>What both variants reveal, however, is that finding the right vantage points is essential. But it's important to acknowledge that thieves who enter through public galleries are not the only threat faced by museums. The British Museum in London, for example saw a Cartier ring worth £760,000 ($950,000) go missing in 2011 from a collection that was no on public display. Gems from the museum were found on sale on eBay in 2020 after allegedly been taken by one of the museum's own curators.</p><p>Alongside theft, museums also have to protect their collections from vandalism, fire and other forms of destruction.</p><p>Even so, the art gallery problem is worth the attention those outside of the hallowed halls of museusms. It has applications in a range of fields where visibility and coverage are critical.</p><p>In robotics, for example, it helps autonomous systems improve efficiency and prevent collisions. In urban planning, it informs the positioning of radio antennae, mobile phone transmission stations or pollution detectors to ensure comprehensive coverage of public spaces.</p><p>Disaster management strategies use similar principles to position drones to survey large-scale disaster sites from the air or to situate medical field stations. In image editing and computer vision, the art gallery problem can aid in identifying visible regions within a scene. It can help ensure performers are always illuminated on stage and even help museums ensure their galleries are appropriately lit.</p><p>The Louvre did not respond to questions from the BBC about whether it was aware of the solutions offered by the museum problem – it undoubtedly has more pressing issues to deal with. But as museums and art galleries around the world look again at their own security in the wake of the Louvre heist, it can do no harm to be reminded of the lessons this 50-year-old mathematical problem has to offer.</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Why is the crotch grab problematic, despite not being always gender-specific or a taunt?</p><p>We're still seeing prison escapes in 2023.

{"details":"<p>By Tom Balmforth</p><p>[1/2]A component of the SSC-8/9M729 cruise missile system is on display during a news briefing, organized by Russian defence and foreign ministries, at Patriot Expocentre near Moscow, Russia January 23, 2019. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Russia has in recent months attacked Ukraine with a cruise missile whose secret development prompted Donald Trump to abandon a nuclear arms control pact with Moscow in his first term as U.S. president, Ukraine's foreign minister said.</p><p>Andrii Sybiha's comments are the first confirmation that Russia has used the ground-launched 9M729 missile in combat - in Ukraine or elsewhere.</p><p>Russia has fired the missile at Ukraine 23 times since August, a second senior Ukrainian official told Reuters. Ukraine also recorded two launches of the 9M729 by Russia in 2022, the source said.</p><p>Russia's defence ministry did not immediately reply to a written request for comment.</p><p>The 9M729 led the United States to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. Washington said the missile was in breach of the treaty and could fly far beyond its limit of 500 km (310 miles) although Russia denied this.</p><p>The missile, which can carry a nuclear or conventional warhead, has a range of 2,500 km, according to the Missile Threat website produced at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p><p>A military source said a 9M729 fired by Russia on October 5 flew over 1,200 km to its impact in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Russia's use of the INF-banned 9M729 against Ukraine in the past months demonstrates (President Vladimir) Putin's disrespect to the United States and President Trump's diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine,\" Sybiha said in written remarks.</p><p>He told Reuters that Kyiv supported Trump's peace proposals and that Russia should face maximum pressure to push it to peace, saying that boosting Ukraine's long-range firepower would help persuade Moscow to end its war in Ukraine.</p><p>Ukraine has urged Washington to provide it with long-range Tomahawk missiles that were not banned under the INF because they were only sea-launched at the time. Russia says this would be a dangerous escalation.</p><p>Use of the 9M729 expands Russia's arsenal of long-range weapons for striking Ukraine and fits a pattern of Moscow sending threatening signals towards Europe as Trump seeks a peace settlement, Western military analysts said.</p><p>\"I think Putin is trying to ramp up pressure as part of the Ukraine negotiations,\" said William Alberque, a senior adjunct fellow at the Pacific Forum think tank, adding that the 9M729 was designed to hit targets in Europe.</p><p>Russia tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile last week, and on Wednesday said it had tested a nuclear-powered torpedo named Poseidon.</p><p>The White House did not respond to specific questions about Russia's use of the 9M729. Trump ordered the U.S. military on Thursday to resume testing nuclear weapons, citing \"other countries' testing programs\".</p><p>After the U.S. withdrew from the INF treaty, which banned ground-launched missiles with a range of 500-5,500 km, Russia declared a moratorium on deploying intermediate-range missiles. The West said Russia had already deployed some 9M729 missiles.</p><p>On August 4, shortly before using the missiles in Ukraine, Russia said it would no longer limit where it deploys INF-range missiles that can carry nuclear warheads.</p><p>\"If it's shown that Russia's using INF-range missiles, which could easily be nuclear, in Ukraine, then that is an issue for European security, not just Ukraine,\" said John Foreman, a former British defence attache to Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p>Ukraine's foreign ministry did not provide details or dates of the 9M729 strikes.</p><p>The senior official said they began on August 21 - less than a week after a Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.</p><p>Reuters reviewed images of debris after a Russian attack in which a residential building was hit and four people were killed in the Ukrainian village of Lapaiivka on October 5 - over 600 km from Russian territory.</p><p>The images showed that two missile fragments, including a tube containing cabling, were marked 9M729.</p><p>Jeffrey Lewis, Distinguished Scholar of Global Security at Middlebury College, reviewed the images with analysts.</p><p>He said the tube, engine and engine panelling were consistent with what he expected the 9M729 to look like and that the markings made a match even more likely.</p><p>Russia has various missiles that can reach across Ukraine, including the sea-launched Kalibr and air-launched Kh-101, but Lewis said the 9M729 offers something slightly different.</p><p>\"This gives them slightly different attack axes, which is difficult for air defences, and it increases the pool of missiles that are available to the Russians,\" Lewis said.</p><p>The INF prohibited ground-launched missiles because the launchers are mobile and relatively easy to conceal.</p><p>Douglas Barrie, Senior Fellow for Military Aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Russia could use the 9M729 to conduct ground-launched strikes from safer locations deeper inside Russia.</p><p>Russia would also benefit from testing the system in a battlefield environment in Ukraine, though 23 uses would imply a military purpose, said Barrie.</p>","headline":"Exclusive: Russia uses missile in Ukraine that led Trump to quit nuclear treaty, Kyiv says","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-uses-missile-ukraine-that-led-trump-quit-nuclear-treaty-kyiv-says-2025-10-31/","message":""}

As a result, enlargement can produce negative second round effects in local economies.</p><p>Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013, lost close to 400,000 residents in a decade last decade, according to the World Bank, which ranks the country among the top five EU nations seeing the biggest decline in population. In the case of Romania, which joined in 2007, the exodus was even more extreme. One out of four Romanians are living outside the country, according to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>Complicating matters is the fact that the EU suffers from a severe labour shortage as a result of an ageing population and low fertility rate. The bloc is projectedto lose one million workers every year until 2050. In recent years, worker mobility among the 27 member states within the bloc has eased some of these shortages, but not always in equal measure as the southern and eastern European countries suffer from a brain drain of skilled workers in detriment to their economies for more developed ones.</p><p></p><p>“While the exodus of (skilled) migrants from the Western Balkans has been ongoing for decades, EU accession could exacerbate this phenomenon as we saw in the previous enlargement,” Lien Jansen, PhD researcher at the KU Leuven university, told Euronews.</p><p>Schengen visa liberalisation has made mobility easier and accelerated this long-term trend too, with many workers using the opportunity to travel to the EU for seasonal work, said Jansen. \"EU membership tends to intensify this process further by removing the remaining labour market barriers,\" she added.</p><p>Still, some experts believe the impact of joining the EU may not be as drastic in the next enlargement as some the candidate countries have been stuck in the process for decades and already experienced a wave of emigration into richer member states.</p><p>Montenegro and Albania applied for EU membership in 2008 and 2009, respectively. North Macedonia, did so 22 years ago. Since, emigration has continued.</p><p>The broader Balkan has seen a constant shift in demographics, as its working-age population has declined and is projected to shrink by about 20% by 2050.</p><p>By the end of the decade, the World Bankforecasts a shortfall of more than 190,000 workers if current labour dynamics continue in the Balkan region.</p><p></p><p>A 2025 Bruegel study shows that some economic sectors in the Western Balkan countries — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia —are under severe stress strain, particularly in healthcare, construction, and manufacturing.</p><p>“It is important to highlight that there are possible economic benefits from outmigration, including trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances from migrants' host countries,” Bruegel’s research said. “Our study shows that this could also be the case”.</p><p>Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the EU has injected fresh momentum to the enlargement of the union as a strategic priority.</p><p>In 2023, it announced its Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, which explicitly targets economic development and socio-economic convergence. The Commission says the plan has the potential to double the region’s economies within the next decade.</p><p>“For the first time, the EU is offering a partial entry to these countries into the single market prior to their full entry into the EU based on conditions and reforms,” Bruegel’s affiliate fellow Nina Vujanović told Euronews.</p><p>One of the constraining factors, however, is that developed European economies also benefit in the short term from this emigration of skilled workers from the Western Balkans, particularly in sectors facing labour shortages such as healthcare, Jansen added.</p><p>“Growth benefits from the EU entry outweigh the population losses,” Vujanović said. She added that all central and eastern European countries that have joined the bloc have experienced stronger economic convergence despite the brain drain effect.</p><p>Vujanović also explained that entry into the EU single market opens growth potential for such small economies because it allows better integration into EU supply chains.</p><p></p><p>Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Moldova are part of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA), a condition included in the Growth Plan, meaning that cross-border payments between the EU and their countries are much faster and cheaper.</p><p>On November 4, the European Commission is expected to present its annual evaluation of the candidate countries to assess their progress and give recommendations in areas such as rule of law, fundamental rights and justice.</p><p>The EU could start by recognising the brain drain effect as a joint challenge linked to enlargement in its upcoming enlargement report, said Lune Bernstein, co-author of the 2024 report ‘Navigating brain drain in the Western Balkans’.</p><p>Bernstein said that supporting measures to help retain and attract talent, such as linking funding to local employment or promoting circular migration, would also be needed.</p><p>“Candidate countries could focus on reducing the push factors that drive skilled workers away, for example, by improving the path from education to work, strengthening key sectors, and offering better working conditions,” she added.</p><p></p><p>Some countries, aware of the issue, have already started implementing reforms to incentivise the return of their citizens. In Serbia, for example, employers who hire returnees from the diaspora to work in innovation and qualified sectors receive a tax break.</p><p>Poland tried a similar mechanism in 2022, when it introduced a tax break for Poles returning to the country. So far, 25,000 people have benefited from the scheme.</p><p>To qualify, a person must be returning to Poland after spending at least three years abroad. The programme guarantees a four-year personal income tax exemption on earnings below 85,500 zloty (about € 20,166).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Is risk of ‘brain drain’ overlooked in the EU’s enlargement process","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/10/31/is-the-risk-of-brain-drain-overlooked-in-the-eus-enlargement-process","message":""}
{"details":"<p>US presidential trips abroad have traditionally been an opportunity to display the power of the American nation on the world stage. Donald Trump's five-day swing through eastern Asia, on the other hand, has been a display of the power of Trump - but also, at times, of that power's limitations.</p><p>Trump's stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea over the course of the first four days were an exercise in pleasing a sometimes mercurial American president. It was an acknowledgement that Trump, with the flick of a pen, could impose tariffs and other measures that have the potential to devastate the economies of export-dependent nations.</p><p>His sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, was something entirely different.</p><p>It was a meeting of equals on the global stage, where the stakes for both nations – for their economies, for their international prestige, for the welfare of their people - were enormous.</p><p>With China, Trump may flick his pen, but such actions come with consequences. They come with a cost.</p><p>For the first four days, Trump's most recent foray into global diplomacy was smooth sailing.</p><p>Each stop was punctuated by a blend of traditional trade negotiations – deals made under the shadow of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs – and personal accommodations that at times bordered on the obsequious.</p><p>In Malaysia, Trump secured access to critical minerals and made progress toward finalising trade arrangements with south-east Asian nations. He also presided over a treaty that should ease border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia – the kind of \"peace deal\" the American president loves to tout.</p><p>In Japan, Trump's Marine One flew past a Tokyo Tower lit red, white and blue – with a top in Trumpian gold.</p><p>Newly elected Prime Minister Sanai Takaichi detailed $550bn in Japanese investments in the US and offered the American president a gift of 250 cherry trees for America's 250th birthday, and a golf club and bag that belonged to Shinzo Abe, the assassinated former prime minister who bonded with Trump in his first term.</p><p>She also became the latest foreign leader to nominate Trump for his much-desired Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>Not to be outdone, South Korea welcomed Trump with artillery firing a 21-gun salute and a military band that played Hail to the Chief and YMCA – the Village People song that has become a Trump rally anthem.</p><p>President Lee Jae Myung held an \"honour ceremony\" for Trump during which he gave the American leader his nation's highest medal and a replica of an ancient Korean dynastic crown.</p><p>Lunch with Lee featured a \"Peacemaker's Dessert\" of gold-encrusted brownies. Later that day, the Koreans served Trump vineyard wine at an intimate dinner in Trump's honour with six world leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit.</p><p>In the US, Trump may be the subject of \"No Kings\" demonstrations by Americans who disapprove of his boundary-testing expansions of presidential power, but during his East Asia swing he was treated like royalty.</p><p>And like the kings of old, Trump arrived in Korea seeking tribute – in the form of $200bn in cash payments, $20bn a year, from South Korea to the US, to be invested at the direction of Trump's government. Agreement on the terms of those payments helped ensure that the tariff rate on South Korean exports to the US would drop from 25% to 15%.</p><p>The main event of Trump's Asia trip came in its final hours, however, as he met with Xi.</p><p>There, the power dynamic between leaders of the world's two largest economies was decidedly different than the interactions Trump had with his foreign counterparts in previous days.</p><p>Missing were all the pomp and the pageantry. No military bands, no honour guards, no carefully crafted menus celebrating mutual national affection. Instead, the two leaders and their top aides sat across a long white negotiating table in a nondescript military building just off the runway of Busan's international airport.</p><p>It was perhaps a reflection of the high stakes that when Trump shook hands with Xi in Busan, he appeared tense. It was a far cry from his relaxed attitude when he told me the day before that he was optimistic he would have a good meeting.</p><p>\"I know a little bit about what's going on because we have been talking to them,\" he said. \"I'm not just walking into a meeting cold.\"</p><p>For months, Trump had been threatening higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the US – as a source of revenue for the American treasury as well as to pressure China to open its markets and control the export of chemicals used to make the drug fentanyl.</p><p>China, unlike many of America's other trading partners, responded with escalation, not concessions.</p><p>If tariffs were a source of economic hardship for China, then Beijing would target America's vulnerabilities. It suspended purchase of US agricultural products and proposed export controls on its large supply of critical minerals - resources that the US, and much of the world, rely on for high-tech manufacturing.</p><p>Trump's mood was upbeat after the meeting, which he described as \"amazing\" and graded a 12 on a scale of 1-10. The president appeared in a good mood even as the plane jostled from rough turbulence as it climbed into the sky.</p><p>But it was a battle of wills and economic pain set the two nations on a path that ultimately led to Thursday's meeting and an agreement on both sides to de-escalate.</p><p>The US lowered its tariffs, while China eased access to critical minerals, and pledged to resume importing US agricultural products and increase purchases of US oil and gas.</p><p>While it may not have been a breakthrough, it was an acknowledgement by both sides that the existing situation was unsustainable.</p><p>The international order that will take its place, however, is far from clear. As Xi acknowledged in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting, China and the US \"do not always see eye to eye with each other\".</p><p>\"It is normal for the two leading economies in the world to have frictions now and then,\" he said.</p><p>That may represent an improved outlook after months of tension, but it was also an sign that \"frictions\" are here to stay.</p><p>China has global and regional ambitions and a growing willingness to expand its influence.</p><p>Trump, for his part, has attempted to reorder American priorities abroad, using US economic might to pressure allies and adversaries alike. And it is those American allies – nations like Japan and South Korea that have long relied on American political, economic and military support -  that are scrambling to adjust to the new reality.</p><p>Some of that scrambling comes in the form of  a bend-backward willingness to accommodate Trump in forms large and small. Gifts and dinnertime honours are easy, but multibillion dollar payments, increased military spending and permanent tariffs take a toll.</p><p>And they could ultimately prompt a reevaluation of relations with America – and, as a result, with China.</p><p>Trump may have received a king's welcome in South Korea, but, in what could be viewed as a bit of on-point symbolism, as he departed, it was Xi who was arriving. And the Chinese leader's Korean hosts had promised a diplomatic reception equal to that received by the Americans.</p><p>Xi is fully participating in the Apec leaders meetings – proceedings that Trump chose to skip. If there is a vacuum created by America's international manoeuvres, it is a void China appears more than willing to fill.</p><p>Trump may be returning to America with everything he wanted from this trip. But, in a twist on the Rolling Stones song that he used to play at his political rallies, it's not yet clear that he got what America needs.</p><p>Twelve people have died and more than a hundred left injured in bear attacks this year.</p><p>The president sets the limit at 7,500 for the coming year, a dramatic cut from 125,000.</p><p>Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.</p><p>The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.</p><p>Thousands of US adoptees do not have citizenship despite being brought to the country as babies decades ago.

{"details":"<p>By Michael Holden and Catarina Demony</p><p>LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Britain's King Charles has stripped his younger brother Andrew of his title of prince and forced him out of his Windsor home, Buckingham Palace said on Thursday, seeking to distance the royals from him over his links to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.</p><p>Andrew, 65, the younger brother of Charles and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has come under mounting pressure in recent years over his behaviour and his ties to the late sex offender Epstein. Earlier this month he was forced to stop using his title of Duke of York.</p><p>Charles has now escalated his actions against Andrew by stripping him of all his titles, leaving him to be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.</p><p>The Buckingham Palace statement said a formal notice had now been served on Andrew to surrender the lease of his Royal Lodge mansion on the Windsor Estate, west of London, and he will move to alternative private accommodation on the Sandringham estate in eastern England.</p><p>The decision by the king, who is still undergoing regular treatment for cancer, marks one of the most dramatic moves against a member of the royal family in modern British history.</p><p>\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the palace said. \"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"</p><p>Andrew was once regarded as a dashing naval officer and served in the military during the Falklands War with Argentina in the early 1980s.</p><p>But he was forced to step down from a roving UK trade ambassador role in 2011, before quitting all royal duties in 2019 and then was stripped of his military links and royal patronages in 2022 amid allegations of sexual misconduct that he has always denied.</p><p>That year, he settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who died in April, which accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. Andrew has always denied her account, which has recently returned to prominence with the release of her memoir.</p><p>Britain's Prince Andrew leaves Westminster Abbey following the coronation ceremony of Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla, in London, Britain May 6, 2023.

The source said the decision was taken by Charles but that the monarch had the support of the wider family, including heir-to-the-throne Prince William.</p><p>The decision to force Andrew to move away from Windsor was also significant after newspapers reported he had not paid rent on his 30-room mansion for two decades, after initially paying for renovations.</p><p>In a rare political intervention into the workings of the royal family, a British parliamentary committee had on Wednesday questioned whether Andrew should still be living in the house.</p><p>Polls show the royal family has been losing the support of younger generations for years.

{"details":"<p>Thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes in India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.</p><p>The violence, which erupted in May 2023 between the majority Meitei and the indigenous Kuki communities, was the worst the region had witnessed in decades.</p><p>It started after protests by the largely Christian Kuki community against the Meiteis, mostly Hindus, who were demanding official tribal status that would grant them access to the same government benefits and job quotas as other tribes, including Kukis.</p><p>At least 260 people were killed in the clashes and around 60,000 displaced people have since been living in temporary shelters.</p><p>Over the past two years, the government has made repeated promises to rehabilitate the displaced, but little has changed on the ground.

{"details":"<p>US President Donald Trump came away from his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping full of bombastic optimism.</p><p>He called it a \"great success\" and rated it 12, on a scale of 1 to 10. China was less enthusiastic. Beijing's initial statement sounds like an instruction manual, with Xi urging teams on both sides to \"follow up as soon as possible\".</p><p>Trump is after a deal that could happen \"pretty soon\", while Beijing, it appears, wants to keep talking because it's playing the long game.</p><p>There was a more detailed second Chinese statement that echoed what Trump had said on board Air Force One.</p><p>Among other things, the US would lower tariffs on Chinese imports, and China would suspend controls on the export of rare earths - critical minerals without which you cannot make smartphones, electric cars and, perhaps more crucially, military equipment.</p><p>There is no deal yet, and negotiators on both sides have already been talking for months to iron out the details. But Thursday's agreement is still a breakthrough.</p><p>It steadies what has become a rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies and it assures global markets.</p><p>But it is only a temporary truce. It doesn't solve the differences at the heart of such a competitive relationship.</p><p>\"The US and China are going in different directions,\" says Kelly Ann Shaw, who was an economic adviser to Trump in his first term.</p><p>\"It's really about managing the breakup in a way that does a limited amount of damage, that preserves US interests, and I think from China's perspective, preserves their own interests. But this is not a relationship that is necessarily going to improve dramatically anytime soon.\"</p><p>There is an art to doing a deal with Trump.</p><p>It involves flattery - and most countries have tried it, including on his trip to Asia so far. South Korea gave him an enormous golden crown, while Japan's prime minister  nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize.</p><p>But the Chinese leader offered only a meeting at a South Korean air base, where he and Trump would cross paths - as one flew in to the country, and the other departed.</p><p>It didn't feel out of step with China's guarded but defiant response from the start of Trump's trade war. Just days after the American president increased tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing retaliated with its own levies.</p><p>Chinese officials told the world that there would be no winners in a trade war. Like Trump, Xi too believed he had the upper hand - and he seemed to have a plan.</p><p>He decided to use the country's economic weight - as the world's factory, as a massive market for its goods - to push back.</p><p>Unlike Trump, he does not need to worry about elections or a worried vote base.</p><p>That doesn't mean that Xi faces no pressures - he certainly does. He needs China's economy to grow, and create jobs and wealth so the Chinese Communist Party's power is not challenged by instability or discontent.</p><p>And yet, despite the country's current challenges - a real estate crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer spending - China has shown it is willing to absorb the pain of Trump's tariffs.</p><p>Beijing would \"fight until the bitter end\" was the message from various ministries.</p><p>\"China's main principle is struggle, but don't break,\" says Keyu Jin, author of The New China Playbook.</p><p>\"And it has escalated to de-escalate, which is a very new tactic.\"</p><p>That is, China hit Trump where it hurt. For the first time, it limited exports of rare earths to the US - and China processes around 90% of the world's rare earth metals.</p><p>\"The nuance often missed in the rare earths debate is that China has an overwhelming position over the most strategic bit of the rare earth supply chain -  the heavy rare earths used in advanced defence systems,\" says Jason Bedford, macroeconomics expert and investment analyst.</p><p>\"That advantage is far harder to dislodge than other parts of the rare earths industry.\"</p><p>So getting China to relax those export controls became a priority for Washington - and that was a key bit of leverage for Xi when he sat down with Trump.</p><p>China had also stopped buying US soybeans, which was aimed at farmers in Republican states - Trump's base.</p><p>Reports this week say Beijing has already started buying soybeans from the US again.</p><p>\"If the US thinks that it can dominate China, it can suppress China, I think has proven to be wrong,\" Ms Jin says.</p><p>\"This is really signalling to the world, especially the United States, that China needs to be respected, that it will not kowtow or give too many political or economic concessions.\"</p><p></p><p>Trump's team has found itself dealing with a stronger China compared to his first term. Beijing has learnt lessons, too.</p><p>It spent the last four years finding new trade partners and relying less on US exports - nearly a fifth of Chinese exports once went to the US but in the first half of this year that figure dropped to 11%.</p><p>Xi showed up in South Korea - after officially confirming the meeting with Trump just the day before - to take part in political theatre that seemed to underline a position of strength.</p><p>As usual, he was in front of Trump for the handshake. He stood unblinking as Trump leaned forward to whisper in his ear - the kind of ad lib moment China abhors.</p><p>At the end of the meeting, Trump ushered Xi to his waiting car where the Chinese leader was immediately surrounded by his security team. The US president was then forced to wander off camera to find his vehicle alone.</p><p>And yet, there are many positives to take away from this superpower summit - the first of  Trump's second term in office.</p><p>\"China wants to be in a position of strength when it comes to negotiations, but it won't break the relationship, because that is in nobody's interest, including China's,\" Ms Jin says.</p><p>For starters, businesses, the markets and other countries caught in between the rivals will welcome the calm. But observers are not sure it will last.</p><p>\"I think over the medium to long-term, the US and China have very serious differences, and I would not be surprised to see some more destabilisation in the next three to six months,\" says Ms Shaw.</p><p>Has Trump got the bigger, better deal with China he always wanted? Not yet.</p><p>Even if he does get a deal, and the two sides put ink on paper, Beijing has now shown that it is not willing to bend to Washington - and that it is more resilient.</p><p>The rivalry between the two sides is likely to continue, if or even when there is ever a done deal.</p><p>Twelve people have died and more than a hundred left injured in bear attacks this year.</p><p>The president sets the limit at 7,500 for the coming year, a dramatic cut from 125,000.</p><p>Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.</p><p>The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.</p><p>Thousands of US adoptees do not have citizenship despite being brought to the country as babies decades ago. Now many fear deportation.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its key interest-rate target by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that another move in 2025 is not guaranteed.</p><p>\"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion.

This isn’t going to be the last rate cut we see.”</p><p>CREDIT CARDS</p><p>With the most recent rate cut, credit card users will save roughly $1.92 billion in interest over the next 12 months, according to WalletHub data.

And you can always call your card issuer and ask them to match other deals you get in the mail or see online.</p><p>You can also improve your credit score, which is used by lenders to judge a borrower’s creditworthiness. Overall, credit scores are falling nationally as credit card balances rise along with an increase in missed payments.

{"details":"<p>By Timour Azhari and Feras Dalatey</p><p>[1/2]A drone view shows the presidential palace, after fighters of the ruling Syrian body ousted president Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, Syria, December 14, 2024. REUTERS/Yosri Al Jamal/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>DAMASCUS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - \"I didn't know the salaries the government pays were this high!\" Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa joked after more than 100 loyalists arrived at his former rebel base, many pulling up in luxury SUVs.</p><p>\"Have you forgotten you are the sons of the revolution?\" Sharaa rebuked the gathered officials and business leaders, according to two people present, remarking upon the large number of Cadillac Escalades, Range Rovers and Chevrolet Tahoes parked outside. \"Have you been tempted so quickly?\"</p><p>Syria's militant commander-turned-ruler has faced a turbulent 10 months since toppling President Bashar al-Assad after 14 years of civil war. The country has suffered sporadic bouts of sectarian violence involving ex-rebel factions linked to his new government, leaving more than 2,000 people dead, and there's been a spate of forced evictions and property seizures.</p><p>The meeting on August 30, which hasn't been reported before, took place at Sharaa's former headquarters in Idlib province in northwestern Syria, far from his official presidential offices in Damascus. The leader, a one-time al Qaeda commander, was flanked by two senior security officials as he spoke.</p><p>Sharaa ordered civil servants with luxury cars to hand over the keys or face being investigated for illicit gains, according to the two attendees as well as two civil servants briefed on the address, who all requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. A handful of keys were handed in as people filed out at the end, the attendees told Reuters.</p><p>The message delivered to loyalists points to a critical challenge facing the 43-year-old president, according to Syrian officials and analysts: how to pivot from an insurgency to a civilian government without replicating the endemic corruption of Assad's reviled police state.</p><p>At stake: the legitimacy Sharaa has gained among many Syrians, and abroad, by ousting the dictator.</p><p>\"Sharaa lacks any institutional framework or textbooks to rely on,\" said Hossam Jazmati, a Syrian researcher on Islamist groups who has studied the former warrior-sheikh for more than a decade.</p><p>\"He's not a product of a state institution but of a faction. Since 2003, he has operated within a militia environment,\" he said. \"Power was based on alliances, favouritism and monopoly.</p><p>Now, loyalists taking spoils of war would threaten his ability to consolidate power, Jazmati said: \"He requires substantial financial resources to sustain his administration — not necessarily for personal gain, but to maintain authority.\"</p><p>Syria's Ministry of Information told Reuters that Sharaa had arranged a \"friendly, informal meeting\" in Idlib with former commanders, officials and other notables which touched on political and security challenges as well as the need to change the \"investment culture established by the former regime\".</p><p>\"He stressed that he would not tolerate any suspicion of corruption among state employees,\" the ministry said.</p><p>It denied any car keys were handed over.</p><p>Sharaa's balancing act can be seen even within his own family.</p><p>Two older brothers hold top jobs in the new government. Hazem oversees foreign and local business and investment in Syria, including the work of former rebel fighters tasked with overhauling Syria's economy. Maher, a gynaecologist with Syrian-Russian dual nationality, is secretary-general of the presidency, chairing official meetings and attending talks with foreign dignitaries, including Sharaa's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month.</p><p>Multiple Syrian officials said Sharaa's reliance on relatives and others close to him was a result of needing to quickly fill gaps in his new administration following the unexpected collapse of Assad's government. Critics see it as a worrying emulation of family rule under the old regime.</p><p>But another elder brother - Jamal, a businessman - has fallen foul of Sharaa's fledgling anti-corruption drive, according to six people familiar with the matter including government officials and business figures.</p><p>Following Sharaa's rise to power, Jamal set up an office in the capital Damascus from where he ran various ventures including import-export and tourism businesses, they said.</p><p>He became a common sight in upmarket hotel lobbies and restaurants, to which he was driven in a black Mercedes S-class saloon with tinted windows and no license plates.</p><p>Sharaa ordered the office be shut in August and instructed government entities not to deal with his brother, the sources told Reuters. The decision concerned allegations that Jamal had used his family link to the president to set up dozens of meetings with government and business figures to advance his personal interests, they said.</p><p>A Reuters reporter found the office shut and locked this month, with red wax blotched on the doors. No one answered the doorbell.</p><p>Red wax is often used in the region, including in Syria, to seal properties ordered shut pending corruption investigations.</p><p>Syria's information ministry confirmed the office had been closed down. \"Jamal al-Sharaa was not permitted to work as an investment or commercial entity,\" it told Reuters. \"The presidency has clarified since the formation of the government that Jamal al-Sharaa did not hold any official position.\"</p><p>The ministry didn't say whether, or what, specific charges authorities had been levelled against the president's brother.</p><p>Reuters was unable to contact Jamal for comment. Reached by phone, the head of Jamal's office said the pair were outside Damascus and didn't comment further.</p><p>Shortly after closing Jamal's office, Sharaa held a meeting with family members, including his 79-year-old father, warning them against exploiting the family name for personal gain, according to a relative who attended the meeting.</p><p>FACTORY BOSS: I PAID $200,000 FOR WORKER</p><p>The warning that Sharaa delivered to loyalists in August followed complaints voiced by ordinary Syrians at a meeting with the president earlier that month over the newfound luxury of some former rebels now in the civil service, according to an attendee.</p><p>Sharaa has since reiterated his anti-corruption message in public in Damascus.</p><p>In an October 13 clip released by state media, he told officials they must disclose existing investments and were banned from entering into new private projects. He also said personal relationships with businessmen should be avoided, warning them not to repeat the model seen under Assad.</p><p>Corruption nonetheless persists in post-Assad Syria, including the payment of bribes to get out of jail or recover houses, vehicles and other valuables seized by members of the new ruling order, according to interviews with nine Syrian business figures and former and current officials.</p><p>One industrialist and two senior factory managers, who all requested anonymity to speak freely, said they had been forced to pay cash to well-connected intermediaries, with no receipt or formal documentation, to keep their businesses running or secure the release of employees detained over alleged past ties to the Assad regime.</p><p>One said he paid $100,000 for the release of a worker, only to be told he would have to fork out another $100,000 if he wanted the employee to be allowed to resume work.</p><p>Another said he paid $25,000 to get an employee released.</p><p>Reuters was unable to independently verify the accounts.</p><p>The information ministry said such practices were not widespread and that some people suspected of taking bribes in exchange for releasing detainees or doing other official business had been referred for \"immediate investigation\".</p><p>A major area of concern within Syria's business community, according to the people interviewed, is the opaque process of settlement deals struck by government officials with people accused of links to Assad. The deals, in which business owners hand over assets in exchange for being allowed to return to work in Syria, began to take shape immediately after Damascus fell.</p><p>Authorities are trying to route all such settlements via a committee on illicit gains formed in May, before turning the assets over to a new sovereign wealth fund that is still being set up, according to six people including government officials and businessmen familiar with the matter.</p><p>The fund now holds hundreds of companies, office buildings, factories and other assets linked to people accused of connections to the Assad regime, the six people said.</p><p>But these two fledgling entities have also come under scrutiny.</p><p>Two lawyers working for the fund have been arrested pending investigations over alleged graft, with one detained for more than a month, the people told Reuters.</p><p>The information ministry confirmed the arrests, saying the lawyers were being investigated over \"alleged theft that has not yet been proven\". Some members of the illicit gains committee, which is tasked with investigating corruption, have also been detained for investigations about suspected wrongdoing though not formally arrested, the ministry said.</p>","headline":"No spoils of war: Syria's new ruler lays down the law to loyalists","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/no-spoils-war-syrias-new-ruler-lays-down-law-loyalists-2025-10-31/","message":""}

That has long sparked concerns that Trump, who slashed admissions during his first term, could effectively grind USRAP to a halt.</p><p>In a post on the social media platform X, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted that Trump’s declaration appeared to shift the definition of whom Washington considers to be a refugee.</p><p>“Trump’s new refugee determination appears to call for admitting refugees who wouldn’t meet the definition of refugee — someone who faces persecution (not ‘discrimination’) on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” he wrote.</p><p>He added that, for decades, the US refugee programme has admitted “people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors”.</p><p>“Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,” he said. “What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”</p><p>The International Refugee Assistance Project, meanwhile, said that Trump did not appear to follow the required congressional consultation process before announcing the cap. The group dismissed the move as baldly political.</p><p>“Today’s announcement highlights just how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world,” the organisation’s president, Sharif Aly, said in a statement.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>“America’s refugee program was built to reflect our values, and the thousands of individuals we’ve closed our doors to represent thousands of missed opportunities of people who could have strengthened a local community or economy,” the statement said.</p><p>Trump’s declaration did not give a reason for the massive cut in refugee admissions, saying only that the number was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.</p><p>The US president has led a massive crackdown on all forms of immigration since taking office, but some advocates had hoped that the refugee programme — which historically had broad bipartisan support — might be spared.</p><p>The cross-aisle support has been buoyed in recent years by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many politicians supporting pathways to immigration for Afghans who worked alongside the US military or allied forces and companies.</p><p>Many Afghans have relied on the refugee programme while other specialised immigration programmes remain constricted or backlogged.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term, Trump, however, has focused heavily on white Afrikaners. In February, for instance, Trump issued Executive Order 14204 to cut aid to South Africa, on the basis that it demonstrated “shocking disregard” for Afrikaners.</p><p>That order also prioritised humanitarian relief, including refugee admissions, to white South Africans, on the basis that they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.</p><p>The first plane carrying white South Africans admitted under the new programme landed in the US in May.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Trump announces  lowest refugee admission cap in US history at 7,500","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500","message":""}
{"details":"<p>Markets</p><p>Hot Stocks</p><p>Fear & Greed Index</p><p>Latest Market News</p><p>Hot Stocks</p><p>The US trade deal with China seeks to resolve a major sticking point of their ongoing trade war: rare-earth minerals.</p><p>Despite multiple rounds of talks with US trade negotiators over the past several months, China continued to slow-walk promises to the Trump administration that it would free up crucial rare-earth metals, and earlier guarantees of expedited rare-earth licenses to US companies never materialized. Beijing even tightened earlier this month its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..</p><p>Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.</p><p>The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China for years has built up near-total control of the minerals as part of its wider industrial policy.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about rare earths.</p><p>Rare earths include 17 metallic elements in the periodic table made up of scandium, yttrium and the lanthanides.</p><p>The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are also environmentally damaging.</p><p>Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.</p><p>Rare earths are also essential for the US military. They’re used in F-35 fighter jets, submarines, lasers, satellites, Tomahawk missiles and more, according to a 2025 research note from CSIS.</p><p>Sixty-one percent of mined rare earth production comes from China, according to the International Energy Agency, and the country controls 92% of the global output in the processing stage.</p><p>There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.</p><p>“Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.</p><p>However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.</p><p>The US has one operational rare earth mine in California, according to Baskaran.</p><p>Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.</p><p>Earlier this month, China added five rare-earth elements – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, ytterbium, and related magnets and materials – to its existing control list, requiring export licenses. That makes the total amount of restricted rare earths to 12. China also required licenses to export rare earth manufacturing technologies out of the country.</p><p>It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that China violated a trade truce as Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.</p><p>The export controls could have a major impact, since the US is heavily reliant on China for rare earths. Between 2020 and 2023, 70% of US imports of rare earth compounds and metals came from the country, according to a US Geological Survey report.</p><p>But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.</p><p>CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report.</p><p>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

{"details":"<p>It started with a suitcase hidden under a bed.</p><p>It was 2009, and Antony Easton's father, Peter, had recently died. As Antony started to engage with the messy business of probate, he came across a small brown leather case in his father's old flat in the Hampshire town of Lymington.</p><p>Inside were immaculate German bank notes, photo albums, envelopes full of notes recording different chapters of his life - and a birth certificate.</p><p>Peter Roderick Easton, who had prided himself on his \"Englishness\" (and been an Anglican) had, in fact, been born and raised in pre-war Germany as Peter Hans Rudolf Eisner, a member of one of the wealthiest Jewish families in Berlin.</p><p>Despite hints about his father's origins growing up, the contents of the suitcase shone a light into a past that Antony knew almost nothing about. The revelations would lead him on a decade-long trail, revealing a family devastated by the Holocaust, a vanished fortune worth billions of pounds and a legacy of artwork and property stolen under Nazi rule.</p><p>Black-and-white photographs gave a glimpse of Peter's early life, far removed from his son's modest upbringing in London - they showed a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, mansions staffed by servants, staircases ornately carved with angels.</p><p>More ominously, one picture showed 12-year-old Peter Eisner smiling with friends, a Nazi flag rippling in the distance.</p><p>\"I felt it was a hand reaching out from the past,\" says Antony.</p><p>He says his father was a quiet and serious man, if prone to bouts of anger. He avoided talking about his childhood and always shut down questions about his slight German accent.</p><p>\"There were clues that [he wasn't] really like other people… There was a darkness around his world,\" says Antony.</p><p>The next big clue about Antony's family history came from a work of art.</p><p>Enlisting the help of a friend who spoke fluent German, he asked her to dig into a company called Hahn'sche Werke, references to which were peppered among the documents in the suitcase. After searching online, she sent Antony a photo of a painting, depicting the inside of a large steelworks - seemingly owned by the business</p><p>Molten metal glows hot on a conveyor belt, illuminating the faces of busy and attentive workers. It is an image of industrial power and might, from an era when Germany was hurtling towards decades of devastating war.</p><p>The 1910 painting, by the artist Hans Baluschek, was called Eisenwalzwerk (Iron Rolling Mill). It had been owned, and was likely commissioned by Heinrich Eisner, who had helped build the Hahn'sche Werke steel business into one of the most high-tech and sprawling companies in central Europe. The documents in the suitcase showed that this was Antony's great-grandfather.</p><p>More research revealed that, at the turn of the 20th Century, Heinrich was one of the wealthiest businessmen in Germany - the equivalent of a modern multi-billionaire.</p><p>His company manufactured tubular steel, with factories spread across Germany, Poland and Russia.</p><p>Heinrich, and his wife, Olga, owned several properties in and around Berlin, including an impressive six-storey property in the city centre with marble floors and a cream-white facade.</p><p>A photograph from the early 1900s shows a man with a softly rounded belly and a straight white moustache. Heinrich wears a black suit, and Olga sits next to him, crowned with a crystal tiara.</p><p>When he died in 1918, Heinrich left shares in his company - and his personal fortune - to his son Rudolf, recently returned from fighting in World War One.</p><p>The war had been a human catastrophe, but Hahn'sche Werke had prospered in that period, satisfying the German military's demand for steel. Rudolf and his family also successfully weathered the economic and political chaos which haunted their country after the fighting.</p><p>However, in a few years, all would be lost.</p><p>In notes found by Antony in the suitcase, Peter recalled overhearing conversations between his parents, and whispers about Nazi threats. Jews were being blamed by Adolf Hitler and his supporters for Germany's defeat in WW1, and for the economic travails that followed.</p><p>Rudolf Eisner believed he would be safe if he made his company invaluable to the Nazi regime. For a time, this seemed to work, but as anti-Jewish laws became more and more extreme, and the abuse they witnessed around them worsened, he began to reconsider.</p><p>In March 1938, the government came after Hahn'sche Werke. Under immense pressure from the authorities, the Jewish-owned company was sold at a fire-sale price to Mannesmann, an industrial conglomerate whose CEO, Wilhelm Zangen, was a Nazi supporter.</p><p>\"It is almost impossible to quantify the wealth stolen and how much those assets are worth today,\" says David de Jong, author of the book Nazi Billionaires, which retraces the looting of Jewish businesses under the Third Reich.</p><p>In 2000, Mannesmann was taken over by Vodafone in a deal worth more than £100bn - the largest commercial acquisition on record at the time. At least a portion of the industrial assets included in that sale would have once been part of the Eisner business empire.</p><p>The dismantling of Hahn'sche Werke, and the arrest of members of the company, made the Eisners realise they needed to flee. But by 1937, any Jew who tried to leave Germany was forced to surrender 92% of anything they owned to the state - paying a host of levies known as the Reichsfluchtsteuer or Reich Flight Tax.</p><p>The Eisners faced losing what remained of their wealth.</p><p>At the height of this crisis, a man named Martin Hartig, an economist and tax adviser according to records in Berlin's archives, began to loom large in the Eisners' lives.</p><p>Throughout the 1930s, his name had featured repeatedly in the guest book at the Eisner country estate, thanking them for their generous hospitality.</p><p>Herr Hartig, who wasn't Jewish, appears to have offered the family a solution to the impending confiscation of their assets by the Nazis. They signed over key elements of their personal fortune to him - chiefly the multiple properties they owned and their contents - thereby sheltering them from laws targeting Jews.</p><p>Antony believes his grandparents assumed Hartig would one day give the assets back to them.</p><p>They were wrong. Instead, he permanently transferred the Eisner assets into his own name.</p><p>The BBC found copies of the original sales documents in Germany's federal archives and shared them with three independent experts. All three concluded that this deal was evidence of a \"forced sale\" - a term widely used to describe the dispossession of Jewish assets under the Nazis.</p><p>Despite losing the fortune they had built over generations, Antony's grandparents and father managed to escape Germany in 1938. Train tickets, luggage tags and hotel brochures preserved in Peter's suitcase allowed Antony to retrace their journey.</p><p>The family went to Czechoslovakia and then Poland, barely staying one step ahead of the Nazis, before catching one of the last ships bound for England in July 1939.</p><p>They had lost the equivalent of billions, but they were among the luckier members of the Eisner family. Most of their relatives were rounded up and killed in concentration camps. Rudolf himself died in 1945 after having spent most of the war - like many other German refugees - interned by the British on the Isle of Man.</p><p>The next step for Antony was to find out what had happened to the Eisner family fortune, and to Martin Hartig.</p><p>He hired an experienced investigator, Yana Slavova, to find out what exactly had been stolen, how it had changed hands, and where it was today.</p><p>Within weeks, Yana had uncovered troves of documents about his relatives, including details of their properties and possessions.</p><p>She was able to trace the painting Antony had discovered at the beginning of his journey. Eisenwalzwerk was in the collection of the Brohan Museum in Berlin.</p><p>Early attempts to reclaim the artwork ran into problems regarding the evidence. Could Antony prove that its sale was tied to Nazi persecution? How did he know it hadn't changed hands multiple times legitimately before ending up in the museum?</p><p>A breakthrough came when Yana unearthed correspondence between the museum and an art dealer at the time of the sale.</p><p>The art dealer had sold the painting from one of the Eisners' former family homes - a property taken over by Martin Hartig in 1938. Hartig had lived the rest of his life there, meticulously restoring the building after damage during the fall of Berlin, before dying of natural causes in 1965.</p><p>After Hartig's death, the property passed to his daughter, who was now in her 80s. She had gifted the house to her own children in 2014, and had moved to a country cottage, where she arranged to meet Antony and Yana.</p><p>The elderly lady made them tea and cakes, which they ate in the living room under a portrait of her father - a man with thick-rimmed glasses and oiled hair, gaunt in the face and wearing a black suit. It had been painted in 1945, just after the end of World War Two.</p><p>Martin Hartig's daughter had a very different story to the one Antony and Yana were expecting.</p><p>She told them her father had always been opposed to the Nazis and had helped save the Eisners, who she described as great friends, from the Holocaust. She said he helped convince them to get away, urging the family: \"You can't stay here. Go to Great Britain, to London.\"</p><p>Her father had also told her he helped them smuggle paintings out of Germany by taking them out of their frames and hiding them among clothes.</p><p>When asked about the properties her family took over from the Eisners in 1938, she said they were all legitimate purchases.</p><p>\"My father bought two houses, legally,\" she said. \"It always had to be very correct.\"</p><p>Other members of the family were more open to the possibility that their ancestor may have exploited the Eisners.</p><p>Vincent, Martin Hartig's great-grandson, is in his 20s and training to be a carpenter.</p><p>He admitted to feeling that his home, where Antony's grandparents once lived, may have had an uncomfortable past.</p><p>\"I mean of course I was curious at some point - where does it come from that we as a family live in this nice place,\" he said. \"I've also asked myself the question, how were the circumstances?\"</p><p>After discovering what happened to Antony's Jewish family, Vincent said he thought the Eisners had little choice when they passed their property to his great-grandfather.</p><p>Antony has no recourse for filing a restitution case for his grandparents' property.</p><p>His grandmother, Hildegard - Rudolf's widow - tried to reclaim it in the 1950s, but backed down after a legal challenge by Hartig. The statute of limitations for Jewish victims of Nazi persecution to claim properties in former West Germany has also now passed.</p><p>For the artworks taken from the Eisner family, however, there is still hope for recovering what was lost.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Brohan Museum in Berlin informed Antony that it intended to return the Eisenwalzwerk painting to the descendants of Henrich Eisner. The museum declined an interview with the BBC while the process remains ongoing.</p><p>Another painting has been returned to Antony from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and a third claim for an artwork in Austria also remains outstanding.</p><p>Among the evidence Antony's investigation has unearthed is a list made by the Gestapo, detailing specific artefacts and paintings which were seized from his relatives. There is a chance his family could find and reclaim more assets in the future.</p><p>\"I've always said about restitution, it's not about objects and money and property, it's about people,\" says Antony. In researching his family's past, he has recovered detailed knowledge of who his father and his grandparents once were.</p><p>\"All of this process has turned them into real people, who had real lives.\"</p><p>This knowledge has now been passed on to a new generation. The Eisner name may have disappeared when Peter sailed to Britain in 1939, but it now lives again. Antony's great-nephew, Caspian, born in August 2024, was given the middle name of Eisner.</p><p>Antony says he was deeply moved by his niece's decision to honour their long-lost family.</p><p>\"You know, as long as Caspian's around, that name will still be around with him,\" he says. \"People will say, 'that's an interesting middle name - what's the story there?'\"</p><p>Listen to The House At Number 48 on BBC Sounds</p><p>Archaeologists believe the musket balls are from a part of the battle that allowed Jacobites to escape.</p><p>Among the discoveries at Oxford's New Theatre are old newspaper clippings and glass milk bottles.</p><p>From candlelit mansions to ghostly art tours, the Big Apple is teeming with places that reveal its haunted history.</p><p>Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica with the strongest windspeeds the Caribbean nation has ever experienced.

{"details":"<p>Every day, thousands of passengers heading south west on trains leaving Aldershot station pass a cluster of solar panels nestled by the tracks. Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it.</p><p>\"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,\" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects.</p><p>Riding Sunbeams built the Aldershot array in 2019 . It's small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. But it demonstrates how renewables can feed directly in to the railways.</p><p>Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. \"If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy,\" he adds.</p><p>Around the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging.</p><p>But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects.</p><p>A key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid – it's hard to get access to a big connection for powering your trains. \"That problem has only become much, much worse,\" says Mr Murray.</p><p>This is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects.</p><p>Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way.</p><p>Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain, is seeking suppliers for rail-side renewables projects.</p><p>\"This is the big one,\" says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract.</p><p>New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system.</p><p>But for trains that are switching off diesel and over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC).</p><p>Efforts are underway in England to develop a new converter device that could solve this problem, though.</p><p>Separately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield.</p><p>The software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation.</p><p>\"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,\" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. \"All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.\"</p><p>But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system. It's retrofitted onto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets.</p><p>\"We eliminate locomotives completely,\" says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. \"Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups.\"</p><p>A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area.</p><p>Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year.</p><p>These will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). But Mr Paczek hopes to see bigger installations in the future. \"In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first.\"</p><p>It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators.</p><p>In the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm's wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule.</p><p>He describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – \"atomised freight\", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can be more than 2km long. \"We're focused on doing the shorter stuff that they're not doing,\" says Mr Soule.</p><p>He adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. \"If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we've doubled the rail industry,\" he says.</p><p>Stuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be \"quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways\".</p><p>But he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the \"go-to\" option for new railways.</p><p>\"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case,\" he says.</p><p>Beck and Bec Lea say the move will allow their teenage daughter to keep making content.</p><p>The site tells BBC News it believes people are viewing riskier sites - but they may just be using VPNs.</p><p>Trump's volatile trade policy has thrown the world economy into chaos, and put some US prices up.</p><p>Harvesting solar energy in orbit and beaming it down to Earth is a decades-old idea. Now, a raft of companies say they could make it a reality.</p><p>Virgin Media O2 has partnered with Elon Musk firm Starlink to offer the service.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

{"details":"<p>Britain’s King Charles took the extraordinary step of starting the process to strip his brother Andrew of his royal titles and evict him from the royal estate in Windsor, in the most dramatic attempt yet to quell the scandal over the disgraced prince’s links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>The move, described in stark terms by Buckingham Palace as “necessary censures,” cements the deepest split in the British royal family in decades. The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with Epstein from engulfing the monarchy.</p><p>Andrew, 65, had faced 15 years of on-and-off controversy over his friendship with Epstein that had reached a new intensity after the release of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew had sexually assaulted her as a teenager.</p><p>Giuffre – who the prince claims never to have met – died by suicide in April at the age of 41. Andrew has repeatedly denied all allegations against him.</p><p>Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”</p><p>Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”</p><p>In the statement,  Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out his residence and take the family name.  “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.</p><p>“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”</p><p>Andrew will move to a property on the Sandringham estate, about 100 miles north of London, which is privately owned by the British monarch. Royal Lodge sits within Windsor Great Park, part of the Crown Estate, which manages the royal family’s land and property holdings on behalf of the British state. Andrew’s new accommodation will be privately funded by King Charles.</p><p>It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.</p><p>Everything we know about Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew’s 30-room mansion in Windsor</p><p>Andrew had sought to end the renewed scrutiny of his conduct by relinquishing use of his titles earlier this month. But his moves did little to stem the flow of negative headlines and sparked fresh questions about how he was able to pay Giuffre a reportedly multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil case in 2022 and fund his lifestyle despite having not been a working royal since 2019.</p><p>Public anger has also grown after it emerged last week that he paid $1 million for Royal Lodge, in the heart of Windsor Great Park near Windsor Castle, in 2003, and only a peppercorn rent “if demanded” each year since then, according to his lease agreement.</p><p>Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status could be removed by legislation, but it would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.</p><p>CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.</p><p>Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.</p><p>“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.</p><p>Virginia Giuffre raped by ‘well-known Prime Minister,’ US version of posthumous memoir claims</p><p>In his interview with CNN, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.</p><p>“She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”</p><p>Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”</p><p>Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”</p><p>The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”</p><p>The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.</p><p>“Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.</p><p>“This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”</p><p>On Monday, the British monarch was heckled by a protester who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.</p><p>Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will retain their titles as they are the daughters of the son of a sovereign – in line with rules set out by King George V in 1917.</p><p>Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has lived with him for the past 20 years at Royal Lodge, will also move out and is understood to be making her own arrangements.</p><p>Ferguson, 66, is the mother of Andrew’s two children. They wed in 1986 and divorced a decade later. She previously held the title of Duchess of York, but reverted to her maiden name when Andrew relinquished his titles earlier this month.</p><p>CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.</p><p>The last time a prince had his title removed is understood to be more than 100 years ago, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – had the title of Duke of Albany stripped from him by the British parliament under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. The action was taken after he fought in World War I for Germany, where he was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.</p><p>CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's cautious governor has dropped unusually hawkish hints of an interest rate hike in December or January next year, with the timing likely swayed not just by wage momentum but by moves in the yen.</p><p>The central bank kept interest rates steady at 0.5% on Thursday as expected, but Governor Kazuo Ueda said the likelihood of its baseline scenario materialising has heightened - language he had used in the past to signal a rate hike was imminent.</p><p>While warning of lingering global uncertainties, the board revised up this year's growth forecast and made few tweaks to its sanguine view of Japan's recovery prospects in a quarterly report released after the meeting.</p><p>As was the case before the BOJ's previous rate hike in January, Ueda also elaborated on the triggers for action with an emphasis on the \"initial momentum\" of next year's wage negotiations.</p><p>\"Ueda's remarks ... contained many signals that, barring major shocks in the U.S. economy or markets, the probability of a near-term rate hike is rising,\" said Takeshi Yamaguchi, chief Japan economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.</p><p>\"Given Ueda's use of the term 'initial momentum,' we think it is unlikely the BOJ will wait until March wage results,\" said Yamaguchi, who predicts a rate hike in December.</p><p>More data will be available by the BOJ's upcoming policy meeting on December 18-19 that would provide hints to next year's wage outlook, including corporate earnings reports and the central bank's \"tankan\" business survey due on December 15.</p><p>Already, Japan's largest labour union group said it would seek wage hikes of 5% or more in 2026, aiming for bumper pay raises for the fourth straight year despite external headwinds.</p><p>There could also be early hints on how automakers - a sector Ueda said he was paying particular attention to - set wages as they face the hit from U.S. tariffs. Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December.</p><p>Ueda may also heed to mounting pressure from within his nine-member board to act sooner rather than later. Two board members repeated their proposal, made in September, to hike rates to 0.75%, on Thursday.</p><p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines.</p><p>\"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December.</p><p>\"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added.</p><p>To be sure, the BOJ may opt to play it safe by waiting until its January 22-23 meeting, as most big manufacturers firm up wage plans at the start of the year, some analysts say.</p><p>By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting.</p><p>In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say.</p><p>The yen fell to a nearly nine-month low against the dollar on Thursday despite Ueda's hawkish comments. Data on Friday showed core consumer inflation in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, perked up in October and remained above the central bank's 2% target.</p><p>Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation.</p><p>Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing.</p><p>\"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"</p>","headline":"BOJ locks in near-term rate hike, yen may sway timing","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/boj-locks-near-term-rate-hike-yen-may-sway-timing-2025-10-31/","message":""}

{"details":"<p>As November 4 election day approaches, volunteers make mad-dash push for historic New York City mayoral candidate.</p><p>By Joseph Stepansky</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>New York City - \"Focus, focus, focus on affordability\".</p><p>It is a simple message, but one that Robert Wood, a 47-year-old writer and a lead volunteer for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, believes is the key to turning out voters in the final stretch of New York City's closely watched race.</p><p>Mamdani's surprise victory in the June Democratic primary - and his commanding lead in the polls ahead of the November 4 election day - has achieved a symbolism that has resonated far beyond the borders of the city's five boroughs.</p><p>To many, it has represented a rebuke to the wealthy donor-dominated Democratic establishment: A path forward for liberal politics lost in the woods in the age of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>But for a movement that has reverberated across the country - and indeed the globe - to fully actualise, Mamdani supporters know he must actually make it into City Hall. That begins and ends with door-knocking: lots and lots of door-knocking.</p><p>In a row of townhouses in the neighbourhood of Crown Heights, an area that split between Mamdani and top opponent Andrew Cuomo in the primaries, a door opened to reveal Nadia on a windswept October day. She said she's already all in for Mamdani.</p><p>\"Regardless of what the polls say, we need to make sure our friends and families get out and vote,\" Wood urged, noting a resounding mandate would help to energise Mamdani's ambitious plans: rent freezes on stabilised apartments, free buses, and universal childcare, paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers.</p><p>Execution will require hard-fought buy-in from state lawmakers and the governor.</p><p>At a nearby, pre-war rent-stabilised apartment building, another man said he was unsure. Wood pointed to Mamdani's vow to freeze rents in buildings like his, which make up about a quarter of the city's housing stock.</p><p>The man is gracious, but unwilling to make a final decision: \"Thank you, I'm still deciding\".</p><p>Down the street, climbing a steep concrete stoop, Wood met Onika Saul, a 45-year-old property manager. In Mamdani's pledges, she worried, \"realism is kind of skewed\".</p><p>\"Anyone can say anything, but action always speaks louder than words,\" she said.</p><p>\"So I think for me personally, being disappointed so many times by so many politicians and so many promises, I want to see more action than words.\"</p><p>But Wood dug in. He detailed Mamdani's activism as a state assemblyman, which included joining a taxi worker hunger strike; he had been arrested in front of US Senator Chuck Schumer's home during a protest against US funding for the war in Gaza; Mamdani, he noted, has relied on small donations, unlike the sums provided by billionaire business and real estate leaders who have fuelled Cuomo's campaign.</p><p>He also pointed to an issue that has been one of the most decisive in the race: Mamdani, he noted, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, a rarity in mainstream US politics.</p><p>\"Zohran is certainly the only politician in the race who will call what's happening [in Gaza], what it is: a genocide,\" Wood said.</p><p>Saul agreed: \"It is a genocide\".</p><p>By the end, Saul still had her reservations. After all, Mamdani's top pledges —rent freezes and universal childcare for children under five — would not directly apply to her. But she said she's willing to give his vision a shot—and her vote.</p><p>\"I feel better about him,\" she said. \"But it’s still the whole seeing is believing thing.\"</p><p></p><p>Mamdani has been trying to bridge that chasm in belief in the final stretch of the election contest. Polls have tightened, with opponent Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York State, making explicit appeals to conservatives and independents to back him or face the degradation of the city as they know it.</p><p>Cuomo, who left office in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations, has derided Mamdani as an out-of-touch ideologue promising the impossible. The attacks have included increasingly caustic messaging, leaning into Islamophobic and xenophobic tropes: Mamdani would be the first Muslim, first person born in Africa (Uganda), and the first person of South Asian descent to lead the city.</p><p>For Mamdani, the challenge has been seeing through a mission statement he elucidated after his come-from-behind win in primary elections in June. The 34-year-old state assemblyman was expected to have his mayoral ambitions dashed against the realities of the city's notoriously hard-nosed electoral politics.</p><p>Instead, his victory was resounding. He took 56.4 percent of the primary vote when adjusted for the ranked-choice system, compared to Cuomo's 43.6 percent. Cuomo soon after re-entered the race as an independent.</p><p>\"We wanted to rebuild a coalition that had frayed over years of disappointment and neglect, to win people back to a Democratic Party that puts working people first,\" Mamdani said after the win, in one of the ubiquitous direct-to-camera social media videos he has used to appeal to a chronically online generation of voters.</p><p>He pointed to areas in New York City that swung towards US President Donald Trump in 2024, only to support him in the primary. It was evidence, he said, that a combination of progressive policies and a clear message on affordability could rally the disaffected.</p><p>\"The headline is clear: we can win back voters many have written off if we give them something to vote for, not just tell them what to be against,\" he said.</p><p>In the months since, Mamdani has more fully embraced his role as a progressive standard-bearer, twice holding rallies with stalwart US Senator Bernie Sanders, whose surprise surge in the 2016 presidential election offered to many a glimpse of a different political path.</p><p>But the real test is yet to come. Unlike the closed Democratic primary, the general election is open to all, including the approximately 20 percent of the 4.7 million registered voters unaffiliated with a party, as well as the 11 percent registered Republicans. The variables are vast, and electoral math is subject to unseen shifts.</p><p>Early voting, which began on October 25, has already seen record turnouts, particularly in older demographics that favour Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.</p><p>\"Please, please, do not underestimate our opponents,\" Sanders said at a rally kicking off the final sprint of the race.</p><p></p><p>It is a question that has hung in the air since June: Why is Mamdani the man for this political moment?</p><p>At a bohemian beer garden in Astoria, Queens, where the New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) held a watch party during the first of two general election debates, Susan Kang attempted to unpack the query.</p><p>Of course, Mamdani's success comes in the wake of a punishing 2024 election season for Democrats, who lost the US presidency, the House and the Senate to Republicans.</p><p>That exposed \"the weaknesses of a conventional Democratic message\", particularly on economic issues and affordability, explained Kang, an associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan who is also affiliated with the DSA.</p><p>Cuomo, to many young voters who buoyed Mamdani's success, is emblematic of the same tired Democratic Party of old.</p><p>Then there is the continued knock-on of the so-called \"Bernie Sanders effect\", which helped bring Democratic Socialist policies to the fore. While Democratic Socialism is a distinct, if amorphous, ideology, the term \"socialist\" has for decades been a political slur in the post-Cold War US.</p><p>But for Kang, the strength that has carried Mamdani is more personal in provenance.</p><p>While Cuomo's approach says, \"I'm gonna whip this city into shape\", Kang said, Mamdani shows a warmth and familiarity with the tapestry of personalities that make up the wildly diverse metropolis. One of his most popular videos highlighted common issues facing halal workers. Others have featured deli workers, subway commuters and cab drivers.</p><p>\"I think Zohran has really shown that he loves New York City,\" Kang said.  \"He wants to make this a city that works for everybody.\"</p><p>In a second-floor office in South Richmond Hill, Queens, Sherry Padilla believes Mamdani is uniquely positioned to rally immigrant working-class communities who feel left behind by establishment politics.</p><p>Mamdani's ground game in the run-up to the primary relied heavily not just on the DSA's sprawling volunteer infrastructure, but also on community groups like DRUM Beats, a political committee affiliated with the Queens-headquartered Desis Rising Up and Resisting.</p><p>He has been leveraging that same support as the general election approaches, continuing to tour mosques, Hindu and Jewish temples, and Christian churches across the five boroughs.</p><p>Hosting a phone-banking event for DRUM Beats, Padilla said she is hoping to convince voters to see in Mamdani what she sees. Her outreach specifically targets the South Richmond Hill area, home to a large Guyanese and South Asian population.</p><p>\"We've had politicians who come into our community, say two or three words in our language and eat one of our favourite foods, and then it's like, 'OK, see you next election season,'\" Padilla said.</p><p>\"Zohran's constantly been in our communities and has been by our working class, our Black or brown residents and supported our struggles and fought with us,\" she said. \"That's something that we've never seen before in a politician.\"</p><p></p><p>In New York City, nearly 40 percent of the population is foreign-born. Working-class immigrants have had a front-row seat to yawning inequality in the city, which is home to more billionaires than any other city in the world.</p><p>Studies have shown that inequality has become more entrenched since the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2021. Prices have risen, but only the wealthiest have seen their incomes significantly increase.</p><p>A recent report by the Fiscal Policy Institute found one percent of the city's population currently receives 44 percent of the city's income. The share is nearly four times higher than 30 years ago.</p><p>At a pro-Mamdani rally in Midtown, Manhattan, Salim Drammeh, who leads Africans for Zohran, said the overlap of Mamdani's identity and the policies he spearheads has the potential to invigorate dormant voting blocks.</p><p>\"In my district, there is a lot of food insecurity, there's a huge need for childcare,\" he said. \"So when Zohran speaks about affordability, it speaks straight to our communities.\"</p><p>\"At the same time, voter turnout in the community is really low,\" he said, noting he helped organise a roundtable with West African imams in the community and Mamdani. \"So I've really been working to increase those numbers\".</p><p>At the same time, the vitriol that Mamdani has received, particularly related to his religion, race and immigration history, has crescendoed in the final days of the race.</p><p>In the final week of campaigning, two House Republicans, Randy Fine and Andy Ogles, have continued to push the US Department of Justice to investigate Mamdani's immigration status and potentially strip his citizenship.</p><p>But Latifa Emery, a 44-year-old from the Morrisania neighbourhood of the Bronx, said those attacks could backfire, instead energising communities long accustomed to being demonised.</p><p>\"If he wins, a lot of people will start to realise that we aren't what everybody says we are,\" said Emery, who is Muslim. \"We're not terrorists, we're not bad people. It's time for people to see that\".</p><p>In the nearby Tremont neighbourhood, Masoud Eleshin, a 78-year-old originally from Ghana, took issue with Cuomo's attempts to connect Mamdani to anti-LGBTQ policies in the country where he was born, Uganda.</p><p>That has included attacking Mamdani for taking a photo with Rebecca Kadaga, a proponent of anti-gay laws. Mamdani has flatly condemned Kadaga's position, saying he was not aware of her views at the time the photo was taken.</p><p>\"That shouldn't be happening,\" Eleshin said. \"I've been in this country for 40 years; you can't blame me for where I'm from\".</p><p></p><p>Back on the canvassing grind in Crown Heights, both the pitfalls and potential of reaching new voters were on full display.</p><p>The event was just a slice of the campaign's efforts. Wood's canvassing group included at least 50 participants. All told, the campaign has said about 90,000 volunteers have taken part across the city throughout the election season.</p><p>At one townhouse, a man answered the door and quickly became irate.</p><p>\"You're wasting your time in this neighbourhood,\" the man said. \"[Mamdani] is an antisemite, he wants me dead\".</p><p>Wood attempted to calm the situation, seeking to dispel a claim pushed by both Cuomo and Sliwa. A range of Jewish New Yorkers have backed Mamdani, who has repeatedly vowed to be a Mayor for all city residents.</p><p>One of two major ultra-orthodox Satmar sects in the city has also recently rejected claims that Mamdani is antisemitic as \"false and dangerous\".</p><p>But unable to bring the temperature down, Wood moved on.</p><p>In a nearby apartment building, 70-year-old Hedrina James said she had not been following the race, her attention instead consumed wth the daily demands of life.</p><p>But after a quick talk with Wood, she was swiftly taken by two of Mamdani's top pledges: A rent freeze, which would theoretically apply to her apartment, and universal childcare.</p><p>“I’ve learned a lot,\" she told Al Jazeera. \"This would benefit so many of us.\"</p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Zohran Mamdani supporters make final campaign push: Why him, why now?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/30/zohran-mamdani-supporters-make-final-campaign-push-why-him-why-now","message":""}

{"details":"<p>The scandal surrounding King Charles’ brother Andrew took yet another dramatic turn after the British sovereign’s decision to essentially evict him from the monarchy as well as the 30-room mansion where he’s lived for more than 20 years.</p><p>The monarchy has been under intense pressure to resolve the Andrew issue amid renewed public fury over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which was further inflamed by the release of his sexual abuse accuser Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Andrew gave up the use of his titles and honors, more than five years after stepping back as a frontline royal. He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.</p><p>Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.</p><p>The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated, with royal historian Kate Williams describing them as “unprecedented.”</p><p>“This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Mrs. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.</p><p>“We have had people in the past losing the title of prince or princess. Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) said his daughters were no longer legitimate after he annulled the marriages with their mothers, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn – but he changed his mind later.”</p><p>She also pointed out Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – whose title of the Duke of Albany was removed by parliament in 1917 after he fought for Germany in World War I. But Andrew’s situation, Williams said, was different as he was censured because of his serious errors of judgment.</p><p>It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old royal, who is known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, as soon as is practicable and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.</p><p>Andrew is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions, but it also seems unlikely that he had any choice. It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee.</p><p>The King’s moves were welcomed by many politicians late on Thursday. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.</p><p>Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”</p><p>He added, “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”</p><p>For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.</p><p>King Charles heckled over Prince Andrew’s ties to Epstein</p><p>“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace statement said.</p><p>Meanwhile, royal sources have told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.</p><p>It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.</p><p>This would have been a very difficult decision, deeply personal given the family dynamics at play. The negotiations to get here will have been challenging but the monarch had to go into damage control.</p><p>For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. Already some on social media are saying the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.</p><p>“Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.</p><p>“This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”</p><p>The unanswered questions hanging over the Prince Andrew scandal</p><p>Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne.

{"details":"<p>Residents of favelas gather bodies after police operation turns to ‘slaughter’ in predawn assault.</p><p>By Alex Kozul-Wright and News Agencies</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>A state police operation targeting a major drug gang in Brazil has resulted in the deaths of 132 people in low-income neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro – the deadliest raid in the country’s history.</p><p>Authorities initially said fewer than half that number had been killed in the favelas – the Portuguese term for slum. Protests against excessive police force have since broken out and activists are calling for Rio’s governor to resign over what local people have described as a “slaughter”.</p><p>State police said the operation carried out on Tuesday had been planned for months. The “sting” aimed to drive suspects into a forested hillside where special operation units were waiting to ambush them.</p><p>The following day, dozens of favela residents gathered in front of the state government headquarters shouting “assassins!” just hours after family members laid dozens of bodies out on a street in one of the targeted areas.</p><p>Among those expressing shock about the death toll was President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. According to Brazil’s justice minister, Lula was “astonished” that the federal government had not been informed about or asked to cooperate in the operation beforehand.</p><p>Arriving on foot and in armoured cars, police launched a predawn raid targeting the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) gang, one of Brazil’s oldest criminal organisations, in Rio’s northern neighbourhoods of Penha Complex and Alemao Complex.</p><p>The gang, which originated in Rio’s prisons in the 1970s, has expanded in recent years and now commands territory across Brazil, including in the Amazon. Its criminal activities include drug trafficking, arms trafficking and protection racketeering.</p><p>Tuesday’s assault involved 2,500 police and soldiers. Many were waiting in wooded areas – where most of the killings occurred – close to the targeted sites. Red Command fired back at the government forces, sparking scenes of chaos across the two neighbourhoods.</p><p>Schools in the affected areas were closed, a local university cancelled its classes and several roads were blocked off. Elsewhere, many shops in the two districts closed on Wednesday.</p><p>Rio state Governor Claudio Castro, a far-right ally of former President Jair Bolsonaro, said forensic work was still under way. For now, he maintained, the official death toll was 58, including four police officers.</p><p>However, the public defender’s office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, reported that the figure was actually 132.</p><p>After the raid, the state government said 118 weapons and more than a tonne of drugs were seized. On Wednesday, Castro called the operation a “success”. He spoke in a video on X and called the raid a “historic day in the fight against crime in Rio de Janeiro”.</p><p>Sigo acompanhando de perto esse dia histórico no combate à criminalidade no Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Acabo de tomar uma decisão importante para o nosso estado, que vai nos ajudar a definir os próximos passos nessa luta. pic.twitter.com/seFOP9JmIu</p><p>— Cláudio Castro (@claudiocastroRJ) October 28, 2025</p><p></p><p>Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Castro to provide information about the police operation and scheduled a hearing with the governor and the heads of the military and civil police on Monday in Rio.</p><p>On Wednesday, residents in Penha gathered next to dozens of bodies laid out in a square, shouting “justice!” before forensic authorities arrived to retrieve the remains.</p><p>Rafael Soares, a Brazilian crime journalist, told the BBC that Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio de Janeiro in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its main rival, First Capital Command.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Police raids against criminal organisations are not uncommon in Brazil’s favelas and often turn deadly.</p><p>According to Soares, however, police operations in which more than 20 people die are “very rare” in Brazil. And most of those happen in Rio.</p><p>Before this, the city’s most deadly police raid occurred in 2021 when 29 people were killed in the Jacarezinho neighbourhood. In 2022 in another raid on the Alemao Complex involving 400 officers, helicopters and armoured vehicles, 19 people were killed.</p><p>And 111 prisoners were killed in Sao Paulo in 1992 when police stormed the Carandiru Penitentiary to quash a rebellion.</p><p>On a visit to the state of Ceara on Tuesday, Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski called the raid “very bloody” and offered his condolences to the families of those “innocent people” killed. He said Lula was “horrified” by the scale of the fatalities.</p><p>But the government will also be monitoring how the public responds. National violence is a key issue before national elections next year. Nearly 50 percent of Brazilians think security has deteriorated under Lula, according to a survey by Parana Pesquisas, a national pollster.</p><p>On Wednesday, Lula took to social media to say that organised crime in Brazil “continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence across cities”.</p><p>The previous day, opposition lawmakers accused the president of protecting criminal groups. “The traffickers’ president must be upset. He lost voters in Rio,” Gilvan da Federal told Congress, referring to gang members killed in the Rio de Janeiro operation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The brutality of this week’s raid has drawn criticism from Marta Hurtado, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p>“We fully understand the challenges of having to deal with violent and well-organised groups such as Red Command,” she said.</p><p>But she also called on Brazil to “break this cycle of extreme brutality and ensure that law enforcement operations comply with international standards regarding the use of force”.</p><p>Cesar Munoz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called the deaths a “tragedy”. He added that “the succession of lethal operations that do not result in greater safety for the population but that in fact cause insecurity reveals the failure of the policies of Rio de Janeiro.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"More than 130 killed: How did a Brazil raid on a Rio favela turn so deadly?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/more-than-130-killed-how-did-a-brazil-raid-on-a-rio-favela-turn-so-deadly","message":""}

{"details":"<p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been the point-person entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank.</p><p>But Bessent's trickiest task may just be the White House bet on Argentina.</p><p>The US stepped onto the scene in mid-September, responding to a plunge in the peso - the Argentine currency - which officials feared could imperil Trump ally President Javier Milei and his party in looming midterm elections.</p><p>Bessent said the US would do whatever was needed to stabilise the situation, calling the country a key ally in the region.</p><p>In political terms, the US intervention - which included purchases of pesos and the establishment of a $20bn (£15bn) currency swap line that gives the Argentine central bank access to dollars - was a success for Milei.</p><p>His party not only fended off losses in the midterm elections but made inroads, strengthening his position.</p><p>But whether the US intervention in the country will be a success financially is another question.</p><p>The peso has fallen roughly 30% this year, including roughly 4% over the last month. The drop came despite the US commitments - and a modest rally after the election.</p><p>It's an indication of the ongoing risk. At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.</p><p>The intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach.</p><p>Milei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\".</p><p>But the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>Adding to the risk is Argentina's long history of currency devaluation and debt default, including most recently in 2020.</p><p>Few are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.</p><p>Bessent famously took part in the 1992 speculation against the British pound. At that time, investors who bet that Sterling had been overvalued were said to have broken the Bank of England with their heavy selling.</p><p>This time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.</p><p>\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.</p><p>On Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\".</p><p>The US Treasury Department did not respond to inquiries seeking more details.</p><p>But it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.</p><p>Analysts have estimated the US has purchased as much as $2bn worth of pesos so far - hardly an earth-shattering figure.</p><p>But Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country.</p><p>Even some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.</p><p>Bessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".</p><p>But while that could be true for a short-term trade, that view is not the general consensus.</p><p>To the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.</p><p>Economists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.</p><p>The Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.</p><p>But it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.</p><p>Economists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.</p><p>That choice presents a dilemma for Bessent, given his promises to guard the US against losses.</p><p>\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"</p><p>The peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.</p><p>People wanted to protect themselves, remembering the way the currency collapsed in 2019 after the election loss of former president Mauricio Macri, who was also known for economic reform, says Joaquín Bagües, managing director of Buenos Aires-based Grit Capital Group.</p><p>\"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"</p><p>Mr Bagües says the demand for dollars has eased since the election.</p><p>But the peso has not experienced the kind of sustained relief seen in other assets, like bonds or the stock market, which surged more than 20% the day after the election and has continued to rise.</p><p>While Argentine companies are starting to tap international lending markets again, after being frozen out ahead of the election, analysts say they expect US banks to remain wary of lending to Argentina, despite a push by Bessent to arrange an additional $20bn in private financing.</p><p>And Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.</p><p>Kathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.</p><p>But, she adds, \"there's a lot that needs to be done between now and then\".</p><p>For now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.</p><p>\"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says.</p><p>The fiscal fight means US troops could go without pay, while millions may lose heat and food aid.</p><p>The US government shutdown continues, with Republicans and Democrats no closer to ending their budget standoff.</p><p>The OBR is understood to have downgraded the UK's productivity level in early Budget forecasts</p><p>The states argue the Trump administration should use an emergency fund for the programme, which helps about 40 million people.</p><p>His lawyers invoked presidential immunity and claimed the prosecution was politically motivated.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have met for the first time in six years - raising hopes for a de-escalation of tensions between the world's two biggest economies.</p><p>Trump described the talks, held in South Korea, as \"amazing\", while Beijing said they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\".</p><p>Relations have been tense since Trump began imposing new tariffs on China, prompting retaliation from Beijing. The two agreed to a truce in May, but tensions remained high.</p><p>Thursday's talks did not lead to a formal agreement but the announcements suggest they are closer to a deal - the details of which have long been subject to behind-the-scenes negotiations.</p><p>Trade deals normally take years to negotiate. Countries around the world have been thrown into resolving differences with Trump within a matter of months, after he imposed sweeping tariffs - or import taxes - on some of his top trade partners.</p><p>Some of those key trading partners are in Asia, where Trump has spent the last several days.</p><p>China has agreed to suspend export control measures it had placed on rare earths, crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets. This has been seen as a key win for Trump from his meeting with Xi.</p><p>A jubilant Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he had also got China to start immediately buying a \"tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products\". Retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans by Beijing had effectively halted imports from the US, harming US farmers - who constitute a key voting block for Trump.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told Fox Business that China had agreed to buy 12 million metric tonnes of soybeans this season, and would follow that up with a minimum of 25 million tonnes per year for the next three years.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the meeting, the US also said it would drop part of the tariffs it has levied on Beijing over the flow of ingredients used in making fentanyl to the US. Trump has imposed severe tariffs on China, as well as Canada and Mexico, for their perceived failure to clamp down on the flow of that drug.</p><p></p><p>The president of the US-China Business Council welcomed the news on tariffs and rare earths, describing these as the most significant outcome of the talks.</p><p>Sean Stein told the BBC: \"You could say that this is a truce, that we are now locked in place on tariffs and we don't have to worry every 90 days whether it's going to roll over\".</p><p>Speaking to Business Today from Beijing, Mr Stein said this \"gives business plenty of time to work on the Chinese and the US administration to make sure that they're focused on some of the long-standing issues that have troubled the trade relationship between the two countries.\"</p><p>However, it seems other tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, will remain in place, meaning that goods arriving in the US from China are still being taxed at a rate of over 40% for US importers.</p><p>More positively for Beijing, it will now be able to speak to Jensen Huang, the head of US tech firm Nvidia - according to Trump. Nvidia is at the heart of the two countries' fight over AI chips: China wants high-end chips but the US wants to limit China's access, citing national security.</p><p>Beijing has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit China in April - yet another sign of thawing relations.</p><p>There was, however, no mention of a breakthrough on TikTok. The US has sought to take the video-sharing app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Beijing said afterwards it would continue to work to resolve the issues.</p><p>The meeting also showed the gulf between the two leaders' approaches.</p><p>Xi was self-contained, and said only what he had prepared. He entered the meeting knowing he had a strong hand. China had learned from Trump's first term, leveraging its chokehold on rare earths, and diversifying its trade partners so it is less reliant on the US.</p><p>Afterwards, he was far more measured in his language than Trump. The two sides would be working on delivering outcomes that will serve as a \"reassuring pill\" for both countries' economies, he said.</p><p>Trump was - as always - more ad-lib. But the US president was also noticeably more tense than he had been for the rest of his whirlwind trip to South East Asia - a reflection of the high stakes in Thursday's meeting.</p><p>The glamour and pageantry on show since he arrived at his first stop in Malaysia just five days ago was also absent.</p><p>Gone were the gold-laden palaces of the sort he was welcomed to in Japan on Tuesday. Instead, a building at an airport, lying behind barbed wire and security checkpoints.</p><p>The military bands which welcomed Trump to South Korea on Wednesday were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Instead, the only sign something important was going on inside was the heavy police and media presence.</p><p>But despite the quieter public face, what was happening inside was arguably the most significant hour and 20 minutes of the trip.</p><p>Henry Wang, a former adviser to China's State Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump and Xi's talks \"went very well\".</p><p>It may not have been a trade deal, but a \"framework and structure has been laid\", he added - calling it \"a good start\".</p><p>Additional reporting by Jonathan Josephs</p><p>The president sets the limit at 7,500 for the coming year, a dramatic cut from 125,000.</p><p>Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.</p><p>The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.</p><p>Thousands of US adoptees do not have citizenship despite being brought to the country as babies decades ago.

REUTERS/Jessica Dinapoli Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers are discounting some Hershey (HSY.N), opens new tab candy ahead of Halloween on Friday, the confectioner's biggest holiday, after it hiked prices this summer due to cocoa inflation, according to third-party data.</p><p>The data, from investment bank Jeffries and Datasembly, showed Hershey was among food makers with the highest volume of products sold at a discount in the four weeks to October 4 compared to the prior year, and one mass retailer put more than half of the company's seasonal candy on sale by early October.</p><p>U.S. consumers are tightening spending in general due to an uncertain economy and government shutdown, and the rising cost of sweets has further prompted them to trim their candy budgets.</p><p>This is forcing confectioners and retailers to turn to discounts. Datasembly said Halloween discounts on all candy brands started earlier this year, were deeper and covered more items than in the past.</p><p>These include products from Mondelez (MDLZ.O), opens new tab, which makes Sour Patch Kids sweets, and Mars, home of M&M's and Skittles, as well as Hershey, famous for Kisses and KitKat bars.</p><p>A Hershey spokesperson said that its seasonal candy - like pumpkin-shaped Reese's - had significantly fewer discounts this year than last year.</p><p>Hershey told retailers in July it would be implementing a double-digit price increase on average on its candy, and media reports said this would be about 10%. The spokesperson said Halloween candy was not included in that price hike, and the company has not significantly changed its spending on Halloween discounts.</p><p>Halloween candy shopping continues throughout October, and the data cited by Jeffries covered all Hershey products which include salty snacks.</p><p>Overall, chocolate candy sales per unit were flat in the 12 weeks ended October 5, but prices rose 8%, according to Circana, a market research firm.</p><p>Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner said on Thursday that Halloween sales were \"somewhat soft,\" and he cited warmer weather and the timing of the holiday later in the week.</p><p>After peaking in late 2024, the price of cocoa -- the key ingredient in chocolate -- has moderated but remains historically high at about triple its pre-2022 level.</p><p>Retail candy prices still do not cover that historic rise so manufacturers are trying to pass on costs to consumers in an effort to restore profit margins.</p><p>Halloween and seasonal occasions like Easter and Valentine's Day are especially important for confectioners because consumers budget for holiday treats.</p><p>\"It’s make or break for our seasonal business,\" said Chantal Butler, Mondelez president of North American confectionery.</p><p>Hershey is among 31 food makers tracked by investment bank Jeffries that had the biggest increase in volume of goods sold with a discount in the four weeks ended October 4, according to a Jeffries research note that cited Nielsen data.</p><p>Consumers love holiday treats but right now want they want \"the best bang for their buck and are waiting for promotions. They won't opt out of the holiday,\" said Katie Thomas, the lead of the Kearney Consumer Institute.</p><p>Thomas added that consumers are increasingly aware of package sizes as companies shrink them to keep prices stable, a tactic known as \"shrinkflation.\"</p><p>\"It's not just the price, it's the value,\" she said. \"Not only do I not want to pay $30 (for a bag of candy), I don't want to pay $30 for really small pieces of candy.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put said some of its promotions in recent months have not been effective, adding consumers are \"very concerned in general about the economy.\"</p>","headline":"US candy makers haunted by Halloween discounts as retailers scare up sales","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/business/us-retailers-discounting-hershey-sweets-boost-key-halloween-sales-2025-10-30/","message":""}

The activities officially aim to “combat anti-Semitism” – a term often deployed by the Israeli government to counter criticism of its genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>In its filing, Clock Tower promises to use AI modelling to ensure that the Israeli-supervised campaign – and by extension narratives – are prominent online during the course of its war on Gaza.</p><p>“If you can create enough online noise, through either social media or highly ranked websites, you’re able to influence AI’s large language models [like ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok],” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor of media analytics and an expert in disinformation at Northwestern University Qatar.</p><p>“LLMs [large language models] are trained on a set amount of data, where they scrape large amounts of [historical] information. However, many models such as Grok, ChatGPT or Gemini use what they call retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where they also pull contemporary data from websites and social media,” Jones said.</p><p>“What companies like Clock Tower X are promising is that, if they can flood the information space with sites and content sympathetic to Israel – what’s called RAG poisoning –  there’ll be enough there to at least muddy the waters around what others see as a clear-cut genocide.”</p><p>Clock Tower, headed by former Donald Trump aide Brad Parscale, also says that much of this content will be integrated with that of right-wing Christian network Salem Media, which in April announced a strategic partnership with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.</p><p>The campaign promised by Bridges Partners has already become the source of an online meme – but not in the way the company or Israel would have been hoping.</p><p>Bridges Partners’ campaign involves an unnamed cohort of between 14 and 18 influencers who would be paid to post in support of Israel. After breaking down the figures included by Bridges Partners in their invoices to Havas, Responsible Statecraft – the Quincy Institute’s online magazine – found that the influencers were likely being paid around $7,000 per post.</p><p>The number has been quickly seized upon by detractors of Israel, who regularly post the amount underneath posts they suspect of being part of the pro-Israel campaign, indicating that they believe the poster has been “bought” by Israel.</p><p>Responsible Statecraft reported earlier this month that the anonymity of the US influencers, who under the terms of their agreements would post paid pro-Israel content since July, could potentially be illegal if their identities remain undisclosed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>At present, the Bridges Partners filing names only one registered foreign agent: consultant Uri Steinberg, who holds a 50 percent stake in the company.</p><p>It is too early to say whether the campaign will ultimately be successful. But the backlash towards the arrangement once it became public illustrates just how difficult the task will be for Israel to change perceptions that have now become deeply ingrained, particularly among younger people.</p><p>“No matter what artificial data is produced, it still won’t be enough to counter the volume of factual reporting of the war on Gaza,” Jones said.</p><p>“However, there might be enough to promote a sense of ambiguity over it, to present both sides as more equal in the conflict, or to present Israel’s response to the attack of October 7 as more reasonable than some now think it is.”</p><p>Al Jazeera has been unable to contact Bridges Partners, Clock Tower X, or Show Faith by Works for comment.</p><p>Inquiries to the Israeli chief of staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eran Shayovich, and to Havas Media Group have also gone unanswered.</p><p>In part two of this investigation, to be published on Friday, Al Jazeera will be looking at why Israel is so focused on changing perceptions of it in the United States.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Spinning genocide: How is Israel using US PR firms to frame its Gaza war?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/spinning-genocide-how-israel-is-using-us-pr-firms-to-frame-its-gaza-war","message":""}
{"details":"<p>Britain’s royal family has stripped Prince Andrew of his royal titles and ordered him out of his 30-room residence in the grounds of Windsor Castle, bowing to intensifying pressure over his association with disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>There has been an avalanche of headlines coinciding with the publication of a posthumous memoir, “Nobody’s Girl,” by Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre. The royal family will have hoped Andrew’s decision to give up the use of his royal titles and honors would put an end to the saga. But it was not enough.</p><p>Once celebrated as a decorated war hero, Andrew, the brother of King Charles III, has been thrown into the royal wilderness, not even invited to spend Christmas with his family at their Sandringham estate, and now unceremoniously stripped of his titles and booted out of his home.</p><p>Andrew insists he never met Giuffre, who accused him of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager, and has always denied accusations of wrongdoing against him. Critics say the royal family and UK government did not act swiftly enough to hold the disgraced royal to account. Giuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41.</p><p>The former prince, now plain Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was one of the many high-profile individuals to associate with Epstein. Andrew has said the pair were introduced by Epstein’s then girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999. He later said they met “infrequently,” adding that their encounters were “probably no more than only once or twice a year.”</p><p>He also admitted to staying at several properties belonging to the disgraced financier, who was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p><p>Andrew is known to have attended a charity fundraiser at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 2000, at which Maxwell was also present, according to photographs published in the Palm Beach Post at the time.</p><p>Months later, Epstein and Maxwell mingled with royalty at a Windsor Castle party hosted by Queen Elizabeth II to mark Andrew’s 40th birthday, as well as Princess Anne’s 50th, the Queen Mother’s 100th and Princess Margaret’s 70th. Andrew later invited the couple back to Windsor in 2006 for his daughter Princess Beatrice’s extravagant 18th birthday ball, according to Britain’s The Sun on Sunday newspaper.</p><p>In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges and registered as a sex offender in a deal that allowed him to avoid federal charges.</p><p>The long-running friendship has raised persistent questions about Andrew’s judgment, given his position at the time as a working royal, a status he gave up in 2019.</p><p>In her book, Giuffre details the three occasions she allegedly had sex with the prince – in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St. James. She claimed that Andrew correctly guessed she was underage in the United States when they were introduced and that Epstein gave her $15,000 “for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy.’”</p><p>She also repeated a claim from a 2015 sworn declaration that the third encounter was “an orgy” on Epstein’s island with the financier and “approximately eight other girls” who “appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English.”</p><p>Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he didn’t admit wrongdoing, Andrew did acknowledge Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.</p><p>The royal has always denied all accusations against him and insisted that he never witnessed or suspected any of the behavior of which Epstein was accused. In a now-infamous BBC interview in 2019, Andrew said that he had severed all ties with Epstein in 2010.</p><p>However, a newly reported email from 2011 has called that claim into question. Earlier this month, The Mail on Sunday and The Sun on Sunday newspapers reported that Andrew appeared to reach out to Epstein once more, telling him to “keep in close touch” and that they were “in this together.”  Andrew has not responded to the reports and CNN has reached out for comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, London’s Metropolitan Police has said it is “actively looking into” a Mail on Sunday report that Andrew in 2011 asked a police officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on Giuffre.</p><p>It remains unclear what the royal family, or other members of the royal household, knew about the extent of Andrew’s relationship with Epstein, and when they knew it.</p><p>The 2019 BBC interview was filmed at Buckingham Palace, but the depth of the household’s knowledge of his friendship with Epstein is uncertain.</p><p>Both his staff and his security detail would have been aware of his movements at the time he associated with Epstein. But the royal family has not commented publicly on any of that.</p><p>Andrew’s behavior put King Charles in a difficult position: effectively banish his brother as a royal outcast or allow the steady drumbeat of negative headlines to risk further reputational damage to the institution.</p><p>Andrew had already stepped back from his frontline duties in 2019 and was stripped of his military titles and charity patronages by the late Queen in 2022. But the palace clearly felt something more had to be done to halt the seemingly weekly drip-feed of salacious headlines.</p><p>On October 17, Andrew announced that he would stop using his Duke of York title as well as relinquishing other titles and honors bestowed upon him by the royal family over the years. (He was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.)</p><p>Andrew said the decision was made in consultation with King Charles, as well as other members of the family, because the “continued accusations” were distracting from the family’s work. “I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first,” he added.</p><p>And there’s the rub – keeping it in the family means he did not give up the titles; he merely gave up use of them, and so technically he still held all of them.</p><p>But critics, including Giuffre’s brother, said there needed to be greater accountability.</p><p>In the end, Charles decided to take the extraordinary step on Thursday of moving to formally take away Andrew’s titles and honors.</p><p>The monarch is understood to be sending royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor to remove Andrew’s Duke of York title from the Peerage Roll, as well as the title prince and the honorific styling of “Royal Highness.” Andrew’s other subsidiary titles – Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh – are dealt with in the same way.</p><p>Andrew was made a duke, the highest rank in Britain’s system of hereditary peerage, when he married ex-wife Sarah Ferguson in 1986. While Andrew was known officially as the Duke of York, it’s not a title that many outside the UK would be familiar with. Ultimately the status of prince is the only one that matters.</p><p>Andrew became a prince automatically at birth, as the son of the then reigning monarch, and that status can only be changed if King Charles issues a directive known as a Letters Patent.</p><p>Despite Thursday’s announcement, Andrew remains eighth in line to the British throne. That status could be removed by legislation, but this would require the consent of Commonwealth nations around the world, which would take time. The last time this protocol was used was when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.</p><p>Despite the deepening scandal, Andrew continued to live with his ex-wife at Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion on the Windsor estate, outside London, despite reported attempts by Charles to persuade him to relocate. He secured a 75-year lease on the property in 2003.</p><p>Profits from the estate are paid to the British government and further outrage was ignited after it was revealed that the terms of the rental agreement effectively mean Andrew has never paid rent on the accommodation.</p><p>The lease required an initial one-off payment of £1 million ($1.34 million). Additionally, he was required to pay a further £7.5 million ($10 million) to cover refurbishments which were completed in 2005, according to a National Audit Office report.</p><p>After those upfront costs, the lease states he has since paid an annual rent of “one peppercorn (if demanded),” a copy of the Royal Lodge leasehold agreement showed.</p><p>The agreement also includes a clause that the Crown Estate would have to pay Andrew £558,000 ($743,600) if he gave up the property early.</p><p>“The National Audit Office reviewed the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge in 2005 and in its report, which was published at that time, concluded that the Crown Estate does not have any special procedures when negotiating agreements with the Royal Family,” a Downing Street spokesperson said earlier in October. “An independent evaluation concluded that the transaction with Prince Andrew and Royal Lodge was appropriate.”</p><p>Regardless, there had been mounting pressure on Andrew to leave the property, which sits in Windsor Great Park close to a chapel used by the royals.</p><p>Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate and Treasury to seek further information on Royal Lodge. “This forms part of our long-standing remit, on behalf of Parliament and the British public, to examine the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of public spending, and ensure the taxpayer is receiving best value for money,” he said in a statement.</p><p>A YouGov poll published in October revealed that four in five Britons would support Andrew being formally stripped of his dukedom.</p><p>The Palace may have felt that it had no option but to order Andrew to leave the residence, given the increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the brewing scandal.</p><p>Andrew has also faced furious questions over his business deals with China and his contact with an alleged Chinese spy. Court documents revealed the disgraced royal’s apparently close relationship with Yang Tengbo.</p><p>In a tribunal hearing in December 2024 that upheld an earlier decision to bar Yang from the UK, it was revealed that Yang was authorized to act on  Andrew’s behalf during business meetings with potential Chinese investors in the UK, and that he was invited to Andrew’s 60th birthday party in 2020. Throughout a government investigation into the relationship, Yang has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Andrew’s office said at the time that he ceased his relationship with Yang after receiving government advice.</p><p>Meanwhile, fresh documents released this year revealed that Andrew sent birthday wishes each year to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A witness statement from a former aide to the royal revealed that Andrew had a “communication channel” with China through Yang but insisted that there was “nothing to hide.”</p><p>This story has been updated with additional developments.</p><p>CNN’s Max Foster, James Frater and Christian Edwards contributed reporting.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>By equating an internationally backed militia with a national army, the US establishment distorts reality and erases Sudanese agency.</p><p>By Amgad Fareid Eltayeb</p><p>Executive Director of Fikra for Studies and Development, a Sudanese policy institute focused on democratic governance, human rights, and civilian protection.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Ben Rhodes, a former United States deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, famously called Washington’s foreign policy establishment “the Blob” to describe its entrenched ecosystem of think tanks, former officials, journalists and funders that perpetuate a narrow vision of power, global order and legitimate actors. This apparatus not only sustains conservative inertia but also defines the limits of what is considered possible in policy. In Sudan’s two-and-a-half-year conflict, these self-imposed boundaries are proving fatal.</p><p>A particularly insidious practice within the Blob is the invocation of moral and rhetorical equivalence, portraying the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) as comparable adversaries. This ostensibly balanced US stance, evident in establishment analyses and diplomatic statements, represents not an impartial default but a deliberate political construct. By equating a criminalised, externally backed militia with a national army tasked with state duties, it sanitises RSF atrocities, recasting them as mere wartime exigencies rather than orchestrated campaigns of ethnic cleansing, urban sieges and terror.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Reports from Human Rights Watch on ethnic cleansing in West Darfur, civilian killings, rape and unlawful detentions in Gezira and Khartoum and United Nations fact-finding missions confirm the RSF’s deliberate targeting of civilians. Furthermore, a report by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) monitor from late 2024 attributed roughly 77 percent of violent incidents against civilians to the RSF, underscoring this asymmetry, yet the Blob’s discourse frequently obscures it.</p><p>This notion has dominated US and international discourse on Sudan’s war since its outbreak when the then-US ambassador to Khartoum, John Godfrey, tweeted in the first month of the war a condemnation of RSF sexual violence but vaguely attributed it to unspecified “armed actors”. By refraining from explicitly identifying the perpetrators despite extensive documentation of the RSF’s responsibility for systematic rapes, gang rapes and sexual slavery, his wording essentially dispersed accountability across the warring parties and contributed to a climate of institutional impunity. RSF militiamen carry out their atrocities with confidence, knowing that responsibility will be blurred and its burden scattered across the parties.</p><p>What drives this equivalence? The Blob’s institutions often prioritise access over veracity. Framing the conflict symmetrically safeguards diplomatic ties with regional allies, particularly the RSF’s patrons in the United Arab Emirates while projecting an aura of neutrality. However, neutrality amid asymmetric criminality is not objectivity; it is tacit complicity. Elevating an internationally enabled militia to parity with a sovereign military confers undue legitimacy on the RSF, whose methods – including the besieging and starving of cities such as el-Fasher, the systematic use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war, the deployment of drones against mosques and markets, and acts of genocide – are demonstrably systematic, as corroborated by investigative journalism and human rights documentation. To subsume these under “actions by both parties” distorts empirical reality and erodes mechanisms for accountability.</p><p>Compounding this is the Blob’s uncritical assimilation of RSF propaganda into its interpretive frameworks. The RSF has strategically positioned itself as a vanguard against “Islamists”, a veneer that conceals its historical criminal nature, patronage networks, illicit resource extraction and foreign sponsorship.</p><p>In a similar vein, the RSF has publicly expressed sympathy and strong support for Israel, even offering to resettle displaced Palestinians from Gaza in a bid to align with US interests. This discourse serves as an overture to the Blob, leveraging shared geopolitical priorities to portray the RSF as a pragmatic partner in regional stability.</p><p>Certain establishment pundits and diplomats have echoed this narrative, casting the RSF as a viable bulwark against an “Islamist resurgence”, thereby endowing a force implicated in war crimes with strategic and ethical credibility. When the Blob internalises this “anti-Islamist” trope as analytical shorthand, it legitimises an insurgent militia’s rationalisations as geopolitical truths, marginalising the reality of the war and the Sudanese who repudiate militarised binaries and sectarian lenses.</p><p>Contrast this with the recurrent accusations of external backing for the SAF from an ideologically disparate coalition, including Egypt, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Iran. These claims, often amplified in mainstream media narratives and aligning with RSF discourse, expose profound inconsistencies: Egypt’s secular anti-Islamist state, Turkiye’s Islamist-leaning government, Saudi Arabia’s Sunni Wahhabi monarchy and Iran’s Shia theocracy embody clashing regional rivalries, evident in proxy wars from Yemen to Libya, rendering their purported unified support for the SAF implausible unless opportunistic pragmatism overrides ideology.</p><p>Moreover, the evidentiary threshold falls short of the robust, independent documentation implicating the UAE in RSF operations, relying instead on partisan assertions and circumstantial reports that appear designed to muddy asymmetries. Critically, any verified SAF assistance typically involves conventional arms transactions with Sudan’s internationally recognised government in Port Sudan, a sovereign authority, as opposed to the unchecked provisioning extended to the RSF, a nonstate actor formally designated by the US as genocidal. This fundamental distinction highlights the Blob’s contrived equivalence, conflating legitimate state-to-state engagements with the illicit empowerment of atrocity perpetrators.</p><p>Even more corrosive is the Blob’s propensity to credential “pseudo-civilian” entities aligned with the RSF and its external sponsors, particularly those bolstered by UAE influence, such as Somoud, led by former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who also chairs the Emirati business-promotion organisation, the Centre for Africa’s Development and Investment (CADI). These networks are often presented in Blob forums as “civilian stakeholders” or “pragmatic moderates”, sidelining authentic grassroots entities inside Sudan.</p><p>This curation of externally amenable proxies transforms mediation into theatre, channelling international validation towards RSF-aligned gains and ignoring Sudanese agency rather than supporting any real civic architects of Sudan’s democratic aspirations. Documented UAE-RSF logistical and political linkages alongside Gulf-orchestrated narrative amplification should serve as a warning against endorsing such fabricated authority.</p><p>These lapses are not merely intellectual; they yield tangible harms. Legitimising the RSF through equivalence or narrative cooption dilutes legal and political tools for redress, confining policy options to performative ceasefires and superficial stability blueprints that preserve war economies and armament flows. It defers genuine deterrence, such as targeted interdictions, robust arms embargoes and the exposure of enablers until atrocities become irreversible.</p><p>The repercussions do not end there. They deepen, fuelling the militia’s authoritarian ambitions in alliance with its civilian partners. Drawing on this contrived equivalence, they have recently declared Ta’asis, parallel governing structures in western Sudan, claiming a layer of legitimacy while, at least rhetorically, brandishing the threat of partition despite the clear international consensus against recognising such authority.</p><p>To counter the Blob’s pathologies, a paradigm shift is imperative. Analysts and policymakers must abjure false symmetry, distinguishing symmetric warfare from asymmetric atrocity campaigns. Where evidence is found of systematic rights abuses, international rhetoric and actions should reflect this imbalance through targeted sanctions and disruptions while avoiding generic “both-sides” statements.</p><p>They must also repudiate RSF narratives. The “anti-Islamist” rhetoric is partisan sloganeering, not objective analysis. US engagement should centre on civilian protection, privileging authentic civil society testimonies over manufactured proxies. The question of who governs Sudan is, first and foremost, the prerogative of the Sudanese people themselves, who in April 2019 demonstrated their sovereign agency by toppling Omar al-Bashir’s Islamist regime without soliciting or relying on external assistance.</p><p>Equally important is to withhold recognition from contrived civilians. Mediation roles should hinge on verifiable grassroots mandates. Entities tethered to foreign patrons or militias merit no elevation as Sudan’s representatives.</p><p>Finally, policymakers must dismantle enablers. Rhetorical and legal measures must be matched by enforcement through transparent embargo oversight, flight interdictions and sanctions on supply chains. Justice without implementation offers only solace to victims.</p><p>Should the Blob prove intransigent, alternative forces must intervene. Sudanese civic coalitions, diaspora advocates, independent media and ethical policy networks can amass evidence and exert pressure to compel a recalibration of global approaches. A diplomacy that cloaks complicity in neutrality perpetuates atrocity machinery. Only one anchored in Sudanese agency, empirical truth and unyielding accountability can forge a viable peace.</p><p>Sudanese seek no sympathy, only a recalibration among the influential: Cease equating aggressors with guardians, amplifying perpetrator propaganda and supplanting vibrant civic realities with orchestrated facades. Until Washington’s elite perceives Sudanese not as geopolitical subjects but as rights-bearing citizens demanding justice, its epistemic maze will continue to license carnage over conciliation.</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"The Blob’s dangerous neutrality: How Washington misreads Sudan’s war","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/30/washingtons-blob-is-helping-whitewash-sudans-war-crimes","message":""}

He later denied to Reuters any link between the lyrics and the Nazis.</p><p>AfD FINDS SYMPATHETIC EAR IN WASHINGTON</p><p>The private reception in Manhattan, hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, underscores the AfD’s efforts to build international legitimacy and challenge what it calls undemocratic exclusion at home.</p><p>“We have no democracy anymore,” Gottschalk told attendees. “You can’t say what you think or what you like.”</p><p>The AfD’s growing ties in Washington come as it surges in German opinion polls, threatening Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives ahead of a series of state elections next year that polls suggest could give the AfD its first state premier.</p><p>\"It's a calculated opportunity to ... attract attention and achieve a proximity to government power that would be completely unthinkable in the concert of European or other states,\" said Oliver Lembcke, political scientist at the University of Bochum, referring to the AfD's series of meetings in the U.S.</p><p>The State Department did not comment but pointed to a photo, opens new tab on X of Darren Beattie, the senior foreign service official, meeting with Wenzel Schmidt and his colleague Markus Frohnmaier.</p><p>The State Department official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media, said: \"When you have an organisation that's outside the mainstream, they crave the imprimatur of legitimacy that historically engaging with American diplomats has offered them.\"</p><p>Many Germans are alarmed by the AfD, whose rise evokes unsettling parallels with the Nazi Party’s ascent in the 1930s, when authoritarian rule was established through legal means.</p><p>Germany's other parties refuse to work with its lawmakers by giving them influential positions in parliament or forming coalitions.</p><p>That pact – known as the firewall – is undemocratic, the AfD argues. AfD politicians say they want to raise awareness about what they view as the worsening state of democracy in Germany, and gain high-profile backing abroad.</p><p>So far, they have struggled. The AfD is shunned by many of Europe's other far-right parties after a series of scandals and inflammatory comments. But, with the return of Trump to the White House, the AfD has found a sympathetic ear.</p><p>AfD WIELDS US TIES TO COUNTER POLITICAL ISOLATION AT HOME</p><p>In February, U.S. Vice President JD Vance shocked European leaders by accusing them of censoring free speech, repressing political rivals and failing to control immigration.</p><p>Vance then met with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel in a sign of support shortly before federal German elections, where they came in an unprecedented second place.</p><p>In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the party's classification as extremist was tyranny in disguise.</p><p>\"The AfD pounces on it whenever these comments come out, and they use it to pressure the government,\" the German government official said. \"This is a problem because outwardly we want and need good relations with Americans, and this sabotages it.\"</p><p>The AfD's grievances include wire-tapping by authorities, moves to bar AfD members from the civil service and undemocratic attempts to exclude them from power, they told Reuters.</p><p>German intelligence earlier this year found the AfD to be \"extremist\" in part due to racist and anti-Muslim views. The designation allows the state to recruit informants and intercept communications and allows authorities to bar members deemed disloyal to the constitution from the civil service.</p><p>AfD politician Joachim Paul said the State Department had invited him to “explain the situation of the opposition in Germany” after he was barred from running for a mayoral position. German authorities had cited doubts about his loyalty to the country’s constitutional order.</p><p>Paul said the U.S. officials he met in Washington were well-informed and told him they would follow his case. However, he added, they stopped short of offering direct assistance.</p><p>AfD BUILT U.S. CONTACTS YEARS BEFORE TRUMP RE-ELECTED</p><p>The foundation for the AfD's ties with the U.S. government was laid in the years running up to Trump's re-election.</p><p>The New York Young Republican Club has for years cultivated contacts with far-right European parties.</p><p>Some former club members went on to hold senior positions in the Trump administration.

{"details":"<p>You wouldn't know it from its numerous screen adaptations, but Scotland runs right through Frankenstein.</p><p>It was central to the 1818 novel's inception and sections of the story play out across the length of the nation.</p><p>After hundreds of film adaptations, Scotland finally makes it onto the big screen in Guillermo Del Toro's new take on the book, with the Royal Mile, Glasgow Cathedral and Aberdeenshire serving as locations for the Mexican director's vision of the 200-year-old story.</p><p>According to the filmmakers, the Scottish places they chose to shoot late last year helped shape the very way they told their tale.</p><p>But to understand Scotland's place in Frankenstein, we have to travel back to a villa on the shores of Lake Geneva in the summer of 1816.</p><p>That's when 18-year-old Mary Shelley began writing the book.</p><p>The daughter of political radicals Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, she'd enjoyed an unconventional childhood by the standards of the times, leading to an early marriage to the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p><p>They and their friend Lord Byron were spending the summer by the lake when a bad dream and a competition to make up scary stories spawned the idea that became Frankenstein.</p><p>Most people know the basic plot. The obsessive, brilliant Victor Frankenstein builds a horrifying creature from cadavers, abandons it in disgust, then suffers a terrible fate as his creation, left alone in the world and inspiring fear in everyone it comes across, enacts a terrible revenge.</p><p>It was Shelley's first book and her masterpiece. Her journey to becoming its creator began a few years earlier when she was staying with family friends in Dundee, as she wrote in the introduction to the 1831 edition of the novel:</p><p>\"I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy...\"</p><p>The final sections of the book took Shelley back to Scotland, if only in her imagination. Victor travels through Edinburgh, Perth and St Andrews to settle in Orkney, where he seeks the solitude and inspiration to build a second creature - a female companion for the vengeful one that follows him.</p><p>Victor isn't very flattering about Orkney:</p><p>\"It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for it inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.\"</p><p>Thankfully, the crew behind the new Frankenstein found today's Scotland much more suited to their filming needs.</p><p>Art director and production designer Tamara Deverell is a long-time collaborator of Guillermo Del Toro's. The Canadian was Oscar-nominated for her work on his film Nightmare Alley.</p><p>\"Mary Shelley's book is like a travelogue,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's in Italy, Switzerland, all over the world. I spent months looking all around Croatia and Hungary but then we decided we could do most of it in the UK.\"</p><p>In 2022, Tamara accompanied Del Toro on a scouting tour of Scotland, starting with Edinburgh.</p><p>\"Guillermo was still writing but we were gasping at all this architecture and that allowed us to visually create the film,\" she says.</p><p>\"We were looking for neighbourhoods, rather than specific buildings, but we couldn't help finding inspiration in everything we saw.</p><p>\"I went to every close along the Royal Mile and then I selected a few to show to Guillermo. It's just so fantastic to be able to shoot right in the heart of the Royal Mile.\"</p><p>Two years later, the production filmed in Parliament Square, Writers' Close and the Canongate. But aspects of other Scottish landmarks also made it into the final film, inspiring the looks of the interior sets, which were built in Toronto.</p><p>The water tower which tops Victor's laboratory is a nod to one such Scottish landmark.</p><p>\"You can't help but notice that our water tower with its pinnacles is partly based on the Wallace Monument in Stirling and the Scott Monument in Edinburgh.</p><p>\"The Gothic arches in the creature's cell are from the vaulted arches of the cloisters at the University of Glasgow. And the tiles are from a swimming pool, built in the 1800s, which we didn't even get to visit because it's on an island [Mount Stuart, on the isle of Bute] but the tiles still made it into the final film.\"</p><p>Popular filming locations such as Gosford House in East Lothian stood in for the Frankenstein family home.</p><p>\"It has all the round domes and double marble staircases that Guillermo loves.\"</p><p>The production also used Glasgow Cathedral, although it was almost dismissed as a location.</p><p>\"We looked in the main space and although it was magnificent, it was just too big for the intimate confessional scene we wanted to shoot,\" Tamara says.</p><p>\"The arches were all too high. You had no sense of the scale of the place. And then I realised Outlander had shot scenes in the lower chapel where the Gothic arches are much closer to the ground.</p><p>\"We'd missed that and as soon as I told Guillermo, we knew it's what we needed for the scene.\"</p><p>Tamara credits these places with inspiring the director to create new scenes and build the story around what they found.</p><p>But Scotland's darker characteristics made their way into the film even when they weren't filming.</p><p>The production team absorbed the spooky atmosphere of the places they stayed, such as Norwood Hall Hotel in Aberdeen.</p><p>It was bought by a James Ogston in 1872 and rebuilt in 1881 to house his lover. Today, Ogston apparently haunts the dining room, his lover is said to walk the main staircase and his wife has been seen in bedroom nine.</p><p>Del Toro wrote on social media that his colleague had witnessed strange electrical and physical phenomena inside room nine and the director had snapped up the chance to stay in the haunted bed chamber.</p><p>They swapped rooms but the stay was - sadly - uneventful in paranormal terms.</p><p>Still, Tamara left Scotland convinced it's a country full of ghosts and the gothic.</p><p>\"Scotland is so old. It is haunted. In Edinburgh, I would get up at six in the morning before the tourists hit the Royal Mile.</p><p>\"And after a rainstorm, I would see the sun coming up at the end of the Royal Mile and licking across these wet cobblestones.</p><p>\"And I was like I was back in the 18th century.\"</p><p>Frankenstein is on limited release in cinemas around the country and will be on Netflix from Friday 7 November.</p><p>Nicola Metcalfe wants more recognition of Mary Shelley in the town where finished her classic novel.</p><p>Historic England names its favourite frightening film locations in its first Horror Histories list.</p><p>Animal Farm and 1984 will both be published in Welsh for the first time.</p><p>Carlisle-based Ruth Bushi says she felt she was \"wasting her time\" after countless rejections.</p><p>The Institute of Screen Arts wants to attract international productions to Guernsey.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>A vision of forest management that could result in ecocide and cultural genocide against Indigenous people persists within the provincial government.</p><p>By Vijay Kolinjivadi and Nicolas Renaud</p><p>Assistant Professor at Concordia University. Assistant Professor of Indigenous Studies at Concordia University.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Last month, the right-leaning populist government of Canada’s French-speaking province of Quebec finally scrapped a controversial forestry bill. Known as Bill 97, this proposed legislation was aimed at significantly increasing the volume of timber extracted from the province’s forests.</p><p>It envisioned handing over at least one-third of the province’s forests for exclusive use by private industrial logging interests while another third would have been open to logging but would have also permitted other activities, including recreation. The remaining third would have been for conservation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The bill faced stiff opposition from civil society and Indigenous people. Months of organised, broad-based resistance paid off.</p><p>The bill was abandoned, but the fact that it was even proposed to begin with is an indication of where the priorities of the governing Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) coalition lie. It believes that it is justifiable to bulldoze over environmental regulations, climate action and Indigenous rights to serve the interests of the logging lobby. It clearly espouses Trumpian politics, even if it officially denounces the United States president.</p><p>Important lessons can be learned from the fight against Bill 97 to ensure that Indigenous voices are not ignored again and similar legislation is not passed.</p><p>When Bill 97 was introduced, the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador (AFNQL) issued an immediate rejection. It argued that for more than a year, it had consulted with the government on forest management and given it recommendations, which were completely ignored. The bill directly infringed on the rights of Indigenous people as it sought to prepare unceded lands for takeover by the logging industry.</p><p>For the Nehirowisiw people (also known as Atikamekw), the emergence of Bill 97 was yet another blow to their longstanding fight to protect their relationships with the animals, plants and waterways of Nitaskinan, meaning “our land” and located about 400km (250 miles) north of Montreal. If the legislation had passed, it would have amounted to a form of cultural genocide – the deliberate erasure of both the foundations of their cultural worlds and the material conditions of their existence.</p><p>Seeing the destructive potential of the bill while it was still being drafted, groups of Innu, Abenaki and Anishinaabe land defenders joined the Nehirowisiw to form the MAMO Alliance. MAMO means “together” in the Nehirowisiw and Innu languages.</p><p>After the bill was introduced, the alliance erected tipis as symbols of resistance and solidarity and issued eviction notices to 11 logging companies operating without their consent. They established blockades on roads and organised protests.</p><p>Quebec’s civil society also sprang into action. Environmental groups, wildlife biologists, fish and game outfitters, industry labour unions and artists also voiced opposition. University students and social justice collectives in Montreal organised support for the blockades.</p><p>Just days before the bill was scrapped, AFNQL, unions representing 20,000 forestry workers, and environmental groups co-wrote a public statement calling the legislation “unacceptable” and denouncing the government’s decision to ignore their criticism.</p><p>This cross-societal mobilisation made it impossible for the government to rely on its usual rhetoric that pits “unreasonable and hostile natives” against the wellbeing of settler society.</p><p>Bill 97 also demonstrated the dangers of what we call bulldozer environmentalism: claiming that the destruction of nature can have an environmentally positive outcome.</p><p>The introduction of Bill 97 was accompanied by claims of its environmental benefits that did not add up. For example, Maite Blanchette Vezina, the minister of natural resources and forests for the CAQ, who resigned just before the bill was scrapped, claimed that handing forests over for intensive logging in priority management zones would be a “better” way to sequester carbon and would “vaccinate the forests from the impacts of climate change”.</p><p>However, environmental research contradicts the notion that logging mature and old-growth forests generates more carbon storage potential. One recent study, for example, concluded that mature “forests store far more carbon per hectare than younger forests” and preserving such forests can help sequester significant amounts of carbon.</p><p>Under the veneer of environmental concern in Bill 97, we saw a familiar colonial mindset, which embraces the idea of treating land as a purely economic resource and not as a living ecosystem. Dividing up forests into zones to re-engineer them for economic purposes reflects a colonial, extractive and Eurocentric understanding of the world. This contrasts with Indigenous knowledge of the land as an interconnected whole. This means that protecting one part of the land only to destroy another part is incompatible with Indigenous worldviews.</p><p>In this sense, Bill 97 was no different from other destructive legislation recently put forward. One example is Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s Protect Ontario by Unleashing our Economy Act, or Bill 5, which seeks to accelerate mineral extraction projects framed as being of “strategic importance” by gutting environmental protections and respect for constitutionally protected Indigenous rights. It also empowers the government to create special economic zones, where existing social and environmental regulations would be able to be revoked.</p><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Bill C-5, which would allow the government to fast-track major projects by circumventing environmental protections, is similar legislation applied at the national level.</p><p>Such bills aim to give private industries the right to make decisions on how to exploit public lands, all in the name of national security and a Trumpian “build, baby, build” mentality. From “sovereign” artificial intelligence data centres to liquified natural gas pipelines and mining projects, Canada is rushing headfirst to hand over land and give carte blanche to extractive industries to do as they please.</p><p>In the process, it’s even doing away with the typical performative theatre of consultations with First Nations and other stakeholders, implementing gag orders, stifling dissent, ignoring legal judgements, outright dismissing environmental impact assessments or parliamentary debates, and ignoring prior legislations on Indigenous peoples’ rights.</p><p>Celebrating the end of Bill 97 is premature. A revised forestry reform bill is expected within a year. The CAQ government is likely to propose something similar or even more draconian in the months ahead.</p><p>That is why advocacy needs to continue and focus on taking priority logging zones for industry off the table. Forest management must be made truly collaborative by involving independent coalitions of Indigenous people, ecologists, labour unions and rural outfitters who live and work on the land and know the forest best.</p><p>The government and its industry backers should not be allowed to manage Quebec’s forests. Under no circumstances should logging be permitted in habitat identified as sensitive for threatened species like the woodland caribou.</p><p>Finally, prioritising the ancestral rights of Indigenous communities to the territory must be part of what caring for the forest means.</p><p>Responsible forestry reform is not to say trees should not be cut for timber. A world where concrete and plastic replace wood products would be disastrous. Responsible timber management is possible and can be achieved while ensuring forest regeneration.</p><p>In the face of global ecological crises that spawn wildfires, climate change, mass extinction and threaten our future collective wellbeing, forest management means caring for the land as a creator of life and not simply a creator of wealth. As renowned Canadian ecologist David Suzuki stated, “it’s not the planet that should adapt to the economy. It’s the inverse.”</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Quebec’s disastrous forest reform bill was killed, but the threat remains","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/28/quebecs-disastrous-forest-reform-bill-was-killed-but-the-threat-remains","message":""}
{"details":"<p>Hundreds of miles off the coast of Ecuador, in the very place that inspired Charles Darwin’s seminal theory of evolution, a wild-growing species appears to have hit rewind.</p><p>A small tomato found in the Galápagos, known scientifically as Solanum pennellii, first caught the attention of researchers in 2024 during a study of alkaloids, natural compounds produced by plants that can act as a built-in pesticide. As the scientists analyzed tomatoes found across the area, they noticed something peculiar: Solanum pennellii from the younger, western islands of the archipelago were producing compounds that hadn’t been seen in tomato plants for millions of years.</p><p>The researchers then compared the unusual plants with Solanum pennellii samples on the older islands. They found that the tomatoes on the eastern islands had a modern defense system, implying that the younger, western plants were not left behind on the species’ evolutionary journey, but instead displayed a possible case of “reverse evolution.”</p><p>“It’s not very common to see reverse evolution,” said Adam Jozwiak, a molecular biochemist at the University of California, Riverside, who was part of the team that made the discovery. The scientists reported their findings in June in the journal Nature Communications.</p><p>“We think that maybe environmental conditions put the pressure on these tomatoes to revert back to original or to ancestral state,” Jozwiak said, adding that the finding “shows that nature is very flexible, and it’s not the way we thought — that everything goes only forward.”</p><p>While the fruit of the western plants looked slightly different — with a purplish color and darker vines instead of their usual bright and warm hues — the biggest differences between them and tomatoes from the eastern islands was found on a molecular level.</p><p>The modern potato evolved from a wild tomato fling 9 million years ago, scientists say</p><p>Analyzing more than 30 tomato samples, the researchers observed that the western Solanum pennellii had a molecular fingerprint similar to that of an eggplant, another member of the nightshade family of plants that share a common ancestor. While modern tomatoes have evolved to no longer produce the eggplant alkaloids, those on the western Galápagos Islands had seemingly re-evolved, or de-evolved, to contain this ancestral gene.</p><p>By studying these molecules and investigating why the tomatoes have reverted to ancient genes, scientists could design better crops for eating, stronger pesticides or even medicine, Jozwiak said. It could also help researchers further understand evolution in various species, including humans — and whether it is more flexible than once thought.</p><p>Solanum pennellii has South American origins and likely made its way over to the Galápagos Islands through birds carrying the plant’s seeds 1 million or 2 million years ago, before the younger islands formed as a result of volcanic activity, according to Jozwiak. While experts aren’t sure exactly when the tomatoes arrived on the younger islands, the plant’s evolution had to have happened within the last half million years, since that’s around the time the youngest islands first emerged, Jozwiak said.</p><p>On the eastern islands, the environment is more stable and biologically diverse, whereas the younger islands have a barren landscape with less developed soil. The toxic molecular cocktail of the tomatoes with the ancient genes not only helps the plants ward off predators, but Jozwiak hypothesizes, it could also help the roots collect more nutrients or possibly protect them from disease.</p><p>When analyzing the tomatoes, the researchers found that it was a very simple change in the makeup of the amino acids that caused the plant to revert to its ancestral traits. Then, they genetically modified tobacco plants in the same way to observe the production of the ancestral compounds and confirm how it works.</p><p>But further study is needed to understand the benefit of this transformation — and why the reversion is occurring in the first place, Jozwiak said.</p><p>The case of Solanum pennellii sheds light on how plants evolve diverse chemistry under different conditions, according to Anurag Agrawal, an evolutionary ecologist and the James A. Perkins Professor of Environmental Studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. But he added that he does not find the idea of reverse evolution in the tomatoes to be particularly surprising.</p><p>“Most evolutionary biologists would reject evolution as a forward process, it is more of a tinkering process that frequently takes detours and reversions,” Agrawal said in an email.</p><p>He pointed to examples such as eye loss in cave dwelling animals, flightlessness in birds that evolved from flying ancestors — such as penguins, ostriches and kiwi birds — and the loss of hind limbs in aquatic mammals such as whales, dolphins and porpoises, when their four-legged forebears returned to the sea.</p><p>Further research, including experiments to figure out the timing and conditions under which the tomato plants evolved to this ancestral state, would help confirm what caused the reversion.</p><p>Scientists have unlocked the vitamin D potential of tomatoes, study says</p><p>Alkaloids in high concentrations aren’t safe for people to eat, which makes studying the compounds and how to control them valuable, Jozwiak said. But, as of now, the wild-growing tomatoes have no impact on human health, since they are not grown for human consumption.</p><p>Jozwiak said he hopes to return to the islands to look for answers to these questions, as well as other traits potentially influenced by the ancestral molecules, such as the plants’ interactions with insects and the rate at which they decompose.</p><p>For certain species to develop island-specific traits is nothing unusual. Darwin observed this phenomenon while working in the Galápagos in 1835, noticing for example that finches had varying beak shapes suited to their food sources found on the differing islands.</p><p>Nevertheless, the term “reverse evolution” can be seen as controversial in the evolutionary biology world, as evolution is usually not thought to go backward, Jozwiak said.</p><p>Furthermore, “since evolution has no predetermined goal, it’s a bit problematic to talk about ‘forward’ and ‘reverse.’ Change is change,” said Eric Haag, a professor of biology at the University of Maryland in College Park, in an email. Haag was not involved with the study.</p><p>Haag referred to the rule in evolutionary biology known as Dollo’s Law, which states that once a trait has been lost in evolution, it will not be regained the exact same way. For example, dolphins once evolved to be land mammals, then returned to the sea millions of years ago, but their tails were positioned differently, and they still had to breathe air, Haag explained.</p><p>Because of this, the paper “represents somewhat of a challenge to Dollo’s Law,” he added. “It appears the specific amino acid changes… in the Galápagos species are some of the same ones found in much more distant ancestors. Converging down to that level is interesting, for sure.”</p><p>Galapagos tortoise species was thought to be extinct until a female loner’s discovery</p><p>But it is complicated, Haag noted, because it also appears that the tomatoes have some differences from their ancestral counterparts — the tomatoes on the younger islands that regained the ancestral gene produced both the modern alkaloids and the ancient ones. More study is needed to understand what is really going on, and whether natural selection favored the ancestral mutations, he said.</p><p>While Jozwiak does not study humans, he said that by viewing evolution as more flexible, scientists could observe other species in which this may be happening — and could also explore the possibility of humans one day “reverse evolving,” or reinstating ancestral genes over time.</p><p>The concept is similar to the rare cases of humans who are born with rudimentary tails, a trait that was seen in primate ancestors over 25 million years ago, according to Brian Hall, research professor emeritus in evolutionary cell biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. What remains now are tail bones that have the ability to produce more, he said.</p><p>However, the term reverse evolution is “non-sensical because it implies that we have reverted to an ancestral state, which obviously, is impossible,” Hall told CNN in an email. He equated it more to a “retention of evolutionary potential.” This is also seen in horses that have one toe, but occasionally can be born with three, like their ancestors, he noted.</p><p>Meet the man who has transformed our understanding of evolution</p><p>“What is lost in modern horses is three toes. What is retained from ancestors is the potential to form three digits,” Hall added.</p><p>On the other hand, Beth Shapiro, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at University of California, Santa Cruz, said she finds the term to be a great way to engage more people in the concept of evolution.</p><p>“It’s simply a human-centric rather than purely scientific way of talking about it. Evolution isn’t directional; it’s random,” Shapiro said in an email. “As time moves on evolution continues — and sometimes that means gene variants that aren’t common anymore become common once again. But it’s just evolution.”</p><p>While the concept that evolution “can go in any direction” is not readily accepted by some scientists, Jozwiak said it is still an important topic worth further study.</p><p>“Evolution was always kind of forced by environmental conditions, by competition,” he added. “It would be nice to show that the traits that species had in the past were perfect for that situation in the past, and if these conditions change now, we can go back to that trait that we had, or other species had.”</p><p>Taylor Nicioli is a freelance journalist based in New York.</p><p>Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

{"details":"<p>As they hike to the group of glacial Seven Rila Lakes in Bulgaria’s Rila Mountain, Maureen Thomson and Jeremy Myers take in the cool mountain air and exhale slowly.</p><p>The US couple, who relocated last year to Bulgaria in the eastern Balkans, say the country’s “breathtaking” landscape of mountains, forests, mineral springs, lakes and rivers often stops them in their tracks.</p><p>When Thomson and Myers aren’t exploring beautiful lakes, they’re likely heading to “one of the old monasteries tucked into the hills,” a waterfall, or taking “a spontaneous drive that turns into a day trip.”</p><p>“There’s something deeply grounding about living in a place where nature isn’t just a destination,” says Thomson. “It’s part of your daily life.”</p><p>So why did the couple, previously based in Denver, Colorado, choose to move to the southeast European country? Thomson and Myers explain that this isn’t the first time they’ve left the US to start a new life in a different country. They’ve done it twice before.</p><p>“I don’t know that I want to live and die in the country that I was born in,” explains Thomson, before stressing that they certainly aren’t “anti US,” but were keen to avoid living a “vanilla life.”</p><p>The couple — who’ve been married since 2007 and co-run a US-based wedding business, Blue Sky Elopements — realized years ago that they could work from pretty much anywhere and were determined to make the most of that freedom.</p><p>They made their first attempt at moving abroad back in 2012, when they relocated to Mexico.</p><p>But Thomson and Myers returned to the US after two years due to challenges with “security” and “infrastructure.”</p><p>The couple say that they found it difficult to run their business from Mexico due to constant internet connection issues.</p><p>After losing her job, she convinced her husband to move to Mexico and open up a B&B. Here’s what happened next</p><p>“Plus, I don’t think we were ready,” admits Thomson. “So we came back to the United States.”</p><p>While they were disappointed that things didn’t work out in Mexico, the couple hadn’t given up on the idea of settling somewhere new. And nearly a decade later, they got itchy feet again.</p><p>Thomson and Myers decided to try out Ecuador, a destination they’d traveled to in 2008 and “really liked.”</p><p>After taking a six-week “exploratory” trip in late 2022 to determine whether it was the right destination for them, Thomson and Myers were ready to take the plunge.</p><p>“It was 2022 when, between the political contentiousness in the country and just a desire for some adventure,” recalls Thomson. “I was like, ‘Let’s go elsewhere.’”</p><p>Thomson and Myers relocated to Ecuador in 2023, along with their two cats, Damon and Pythias, and quickly threw themselves into life in the South American country, which is renowned for its diverse landscapes and wildlife.</p><p>Determined to make a success of this move, they got an apartment in Quito and invested time and money into making it comfortable.</p><p>But after 18 months of struggling to adapt, the couple were forced to accept that Ecuador was “a bad fit” for them.</p><p>“We are introverts,” explains Thomson. “We’re not shy, but we like our quiet and our peace. And Latin American cultures are noisy.</p><p>“The pace of life is very different than what we are accustomed to. And it just didn’t feel like a good mesh for our values.”</p><p>Thomson points out that they were plagued by “frequent power outages” during their time there as well and it ultimately was an “entirely different place” to the destination they’d been enamored by back in 2008.</p><p>After a nationwide state of emergency was called in Ecuador last year as an “internal armed conflict” broke out, Thomson decided enough was enough.</p><p>“I just looked at (Jeremy) one day and said, ‘This is never going to end. There’s always going to be a strike, there’s always going to be a power outage…</p><p>“We need to go somewhere that’s not in constant crisis,’” she recalls, conceding that she didn’t feel safe there. The US State Department currently advises US citizens to “exercise increased caution in Ecuador due to risk of crime, terrorism, unrest, and kidnapping.”</p><p>Thomson admits it took a while to convince Myers that they should pack up and leave yet another country.</p><p>“The cost of living in Ecuador was quite affordable, but getting there was not cheap,” explains Thomson, adding that they ended up giving away most of their stuff in Ecuador to charity before they left.</p><p>“You have to stay in a place for a certain number of years to recoup the expense of the exploratory trip.”</p><p>Once they were both on the same page, Thomson and Myers remained in Ecuador while they tried to figure out their next move.</p><p>Determined to find the right destination for them, the couple created an “oh so detailed” spreadsheet listing all of the places they could potentially move to, with France and Slovenia high on the list.</p><p>Thomson and Myers explain that they wanted to live somewhere with good hiking opportunities, as they “like being outside,” as well as a strong international community and manageable weather.</p><p>“We don’t like it too hot or too cold, I’ve a very narrow window,” says Thomson, explaining that the spreadsheet was useful as it “quantified everything” and “took a lot of the emotion out.”</p><p>After whittling their list down to a few top contenders, they eventually decided on Bulgaria, mainly because it met their requirements and regulations would allow them to continue running their business while on a retirement visa.</p><p>She moved to France with her beloved pets, but then her plans took a sad turn after she arrived</p><p>“It was pretty close between Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania…” says Thomson, adding that all three countries had “beautiful hiking,” natural landscapes, an affordable cost of living and similar weather.</p><p>“We tend to gravitate toward mountain towns because we like things a little cooler.”</p><p>Once they’d made their decision, the couple went back to the US to apply for a Bulgarian D visa, a long-stay visa for non-EU citizens that is required to apply for a Bulgarian residence permit, opting not to take an exploratory trip to Bulgaria beforehand.</p><p>In December 2024, the couple arrived in Bulgaria to begin their new lives, desperately hoping that things would work out for them this time.</p><p>They initially stayed in Sofia, before moving to the ancient city of Plovdiv, known as the “City of the Seven Hills,” in southern Bulgaria, four weeks later.</p><p>“We did not choose Sofia as a permanent home, because it’s a city and (Jeremy) rides a bike,” explains Maureen, adding that it was perhaps “too big a city” for them.</p><p>While they’re still finding their feet, Thomson and Myers feel that Bulgaria suits them immensely and they love the “relaxed” way of life there.</p><p>Myers says he’s found that Bulgarians have a better work/life balance and are more focused on family.</p><p>“Here they work, and then they stop,” he says. “In the United States, they never stop.”</p><p>As for cultural differences, the couple explain that while Bulgarians can come across as “brusque,” locals have been hugely welcoming.</p><p>Myers is also a fan of Bulgaria’s food as well as its “slower pace” and “unbelievable history.”</p><p>“Of course, they have their own political problems,” says Myers. “But we don’t know what the heck those things are about. So we’re just kind of disconnected from that.”</p><p>Although they admit to struggling to learn the language, the couple are determined to master it, and have found that locals are “so appreciative” when they make an attempt at speaking Bulgarian as “they know how hard” it is to learn.</p><p>Safety has been a major factor for Thomson, and she says she can walk alone at night in Bulgaria without any worries — something she didn’t feel comfortable doing in Ecuador.</p><p>“I do not worry about mass shootings,” she says, admitting that she used to “scope out the exits” whenever she walked into a new place in the US.</p><p>“If I hear a loud bang, I assume it’s a car backfiring, as opposed to hitting the ground like I would in the US… That’s the big thing for me, I just feel like I can breathe.”</p><p>While the couple admit to missing the “efficiency” in the US, where things tend to get done “when you want something,” this is a sacrifice they’re willing to make.</p><p>“I’ll adapt before I expect Bulgaria to adapt,” says Thomson.</p><p>They’ve made some friends in Plovdiv, but point out that the international community isn’t as “active” as they’d anticipated.</p><p>Although they love their apartment and have settled into the community well, the city is “hotter than hell” in the summertime, says Thomson.</p><p>So after around 10 months in Plovdiv, the couple are moving once again. This time to Bansko, a mountain ski resort town that they visited this summer and fell in love with.</p><p>Thomson says that she finds it to be similar to Breckenridge, a skiing town in Colorado, while still “retaining the charm of a Bulgarian village.”</p><p>The couple recently took out an 18-month lease on a three bedroom/three bathroom apartment located a short walk from the town square.</p><p>“We are very excited,” Thomson adds, explaining that there’s “hiking all over the place” and the city is becoming a bit of a digital nomad hub.</p><p>“I fit in well with the digital nomads, because I still work, and I guess I technically am one,” says Thomson.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Bansko is “not hot in the summer,” says Thomson.</p><p>While finding the perfect place has been far from straightforward, Thomson feels that Bulgaria is the right fit for them, and stresses that they have “no desire to move again.”</p><p>‘It feels safe here’: Why this couple moved their family from the US to Switzerland</p><p>“It is not cheap to move from one country to another,” she adds.</p><p>Thomson and Myers have since launched a YouTube channel, Expat Journey, detailing their experiences moving from one country to another.</p><p>They plan to go back to the US every now and then to visit family and friends, but stress that the visits will be few and far between, as they find the journey, which involves flying to Istanbul, and taking a 13-hour flight to Denver, “exhausting” and “arduous.”</p><p>So would they ever return to the US permanently? Never say never.</p><p>“We are very fortunate in that we have our health,” says Thomson. “But it would have to be some sort of an extenuating circumstance – a health crisis, or a political crisis.”</p><p>Reflecting on their previous relocation attempts, Thomson jokes that “sometimes the second or third time’s the charm.”</p><p>“We were saying, ‘When are we going to get this right?” she recalls. “But now that we’re in Bulgaria, it feels like we’re on the cusp of getting it right.”</p><p>Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter.

{"details":"<p>There may be a ceasefire in place, but Israel still kills Palestinians in Gaza every day.</p><p>By Sara Awad</p><p>Palestinian writer based in Gaza.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Last Sunday, I stepped out of my family’s tent in az-Zawayda, in the central Gaza Strip and headed to the nearby Twix Cafe, a coworking space for freelancers and students. Ten days had passed since the “ceasefire” was announced and I thought it must finally be safe for me to go out. Venturing out was supposed to be a step towards reclaiming a small part of my old life.</p><p>My brother and I were almost at the cafe when we heard a very familiar sound – the thunder of an explosion. An Israeli drone had hit the entrance of Twix Cafe.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I froze. I thought, this is it – it’s my turn. I won’t survive this war.</p><p>Three people were killed and several others were injured. Had my brother and I left my family’s tent a few minutes earlier, we, too, may have been among the casualties.</p><p>As the news spread, my family went into panic, calling us over and over again. The signal was weak, and their attempts to reach us were failing. We were able to comfort our mum only when we got back to the tent.</p><p>I asked myself, what kind of “ceasefire” is this? I felt more anger than fear.</p><p>When the ceasefire agreement came into effect and we were told by foreign leaders that the war was over, many of us dared to hope. We thought the explosions would finally stop, that we could begin to rebuild our shattered lives without fear.</p><p>But there is no such hope under Israeli occupation. The violence never truly ends. That day, when the Israeli army bombed Twix Cafe, it also bombed dozens of other places throughout the Gaza Strip, killing at least 45 people and injuring many more.</p><p>It was the single deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect. No day has passed without casualties; Israel continues to kill every day. By now, more than 100 Palestinians have been murdered since the so-called ceasefire was announced.</p><p>Among them were 11 members of the Abu Shaaban family. The massacre happened on October 18, the day before the mass bombing. The Abu Shaabans were trying to return to their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, riding in one vehicle. An Israeli bomb ended the lives of four adults: Sufian, Samar, Ihab and Randa; and seven children: Karam, aged 10, Anas, eight, Nesma, 12, Nasser, 13, Jumana, 10, Ibrahim, six, and Mohammed, five.</p><p>This is what Israel calls a “ceasefire”.</p><p>On Sunday, panic and insecurity spread throughout the Strip as the mass bombardment started. As explosions were going off, people rushed to the markets to secure as much food as they could afford to prepare for the war and starvation resuming.</p><p>It was heartbreaking to see how, amid the bombs, people’s minds automatically focused on food. It seems we have lost forever the feeling of security, of knowing that tomorrow we will have food on the table.</p><p>And yes, we are still forced to buy our food because Israel is not only violating the “ceasefire” by bombing us, but also withholding the aid it signed onto allowing. At least 600 trucks of aid were supposed to enter Gaza per day. According to the Gaza Media Office, just 986 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect on October 11 – just 15 percent of what was promised. The World Food Programme (WFP) counted just 530 of its trucks being allowed in. UNRWA has 6,000 waiting to enter; none has been allowed.</p><p>Yesterday, the WFP spokesperson said no large aid convoys have entered Gaza City; Israel still does not give the agency the permission to use Salah al-Din Street. The Israeli policy of starving Gaza’s north is still in effect.</p><p>The Rafah border crossing with Egypt – our only outlet to the rest of the world – remains closed. We don’t know when it will open again; when the thousands of injured people will be allowed to cross for urgent medical treatment; when students will be able to leave to continue their education; when families, torn apart by the war, will be reunited; when those who love Gaza – those who have waited so long to come home – will finally be able to return.</p><p>It is by now clear that Israel is treating this “ceasefire” like a switch – turning it on and off as it pleases. On Sunday, we were back to massive bombardment, on Monday, it was “ceasefire” again. As if nothing had happened, as though 45 people hadn’t been massacred, as if no homes had been destroyed and no families shattered. It is devastating to see our lives treated as if they do not matter. It is soul-crushing to know that Israel can resume mass murder whenever it wants, without warning, without an excuse.</p><p>This ceasefire is nothing more than a pause in what we now believe is an endless war – a moment of silence that can end at any moment. We will remain at the mercy of a murderous occupier until the world finally recognises our right to live and takes real action to secure it. Until then, we will remain numbers in headlines about Israel’s endless killing spree.</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"We survived the war, we may not survive the ceasefire","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/25/we-survived-the-war-we-may-not-survive-the-ceasefire","message":""}

The value of sterling was little changed against the dollar.</p><p>Bond prices fell much more sharply in July when Reeves was visibly upset and cried in parliament, alarming investors who were briefly left uncertain about her grip on the job and what that meant for her plans to fix Britain's public finances.</p><p>Lawmakers from the opposition Conservative Party had called for a full investigation into Reeves and her rental licence, with Conservative Party finance policy chief Mel Stride saying her position was untenable.</p><p>Reeves is under huge pressure before her November budget, with expectations she will be forced to break election pledges and hike some taxes after warnings official forecasts could show the economy is in a worse state than once thought.</p><p>Since winning an election 15 months ago, Starmer has already lost some high-profile ministers, most notably former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner. She resigned in September after a report found she had breached the ministerial code by not paying the correct taxes when she purchased a property.</p>","headline":"UK's Reeves seeks to defuse rental dispute with release of new details","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-starmer-rejects-calls-investigation-into-reeves-house-rental-error-2025-10-30/","message":""}

{"details":"<p>The PKK’s dissolution marks a uniquely Turkish path to peace, strengthening energy security and regional cooperation.</p><p>By Murat Cahid Cıngı</p><p>Member of Parliament for Kayseri, Republic of Türkiye.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>For nearly half a century, terrorism has cast a shadow over Turkiye’s political, social and economic life. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq and Iran have destabilised the region through separatist violence. The PKK’s dissolution in May 2025 marks a defining moment, not only ending armed conflict but also opening a transformation with the potential to reshape the region’s future.</p><p>As unresolved conflicts, rising migration pressures and energy rivalries heighten global uncertainty, Turkiye’s decisive steps offer the prospect of lasting peace, secure energy corridors and sustainable prosperity for Turkiye and the wider region.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The human and economic toll of terrorism was staggering. Nearly 50,000 lives were lost, and 1.1 million people were displaced during the decades-long campaign of violence from the early 1980s to the 2020s.</p><p>Terrorism was not only a security issue but also an economic and social burden for the country. Beyond the human tragedy, the economic cost was equally devastating. Official assessments estimate $1.8 trillion in direct counterterrorism spending and more than $3 trillion when lost growth, investment, tourism and infrastructure damage are taken into account.</p><p>Peace, on the other hand, promises a reversal. Analyses show that eliminating terrorism-related costs could trigger a substantial rise in per capita income in the southeast over the medium term. In addition, a $14bn programme of 198 projects through 2028 aims to create around 570,000 jobs, focusing on agriculture, tourism and private investment.</p><p>What sets Turkiye’s conflict settlement apart is its focus on inclusive and participatory citizenship. Rather than relying on external mediation, this is the first peacebuilding effort conducted entirely through a nation’s democratic institutions, with the parliament leading the initiative.</p><p>Historically, following the emergence of nation-states in the 20th century, many countries confronted secessionist movements that often evolved into terrorism over time. For example, the Good Friday Agreement, which ended “the Troubles,” was achieved through cooperation between the British and Irish governments, with mediation by the United States and Canada, and was finalised within seven years.</p><p>In Spain’s case, the peace process with ETA was overseen by the International Contact Group and prominent figures such as Kofi Annan, supported by Norway, Switzerland, and France, and concluded within six years. Similarly, Colombia’s peace accord with FARC, reached in four years, was facilitated by Norway and Cuba as guarantor states.</p><p>In contrast, the period between President Erdogan’s initial call in late 2024 and the PKK’s dissolution announcement in May 2025 – symbolised by the organisation’s burning of weapons to demonstrate its goodwill – spanned less than a year, a pace unmatched in the modern history of peace processes.</p><p>As Professor Ira William Zartman noted in his “ripeness theory,” peacemaking becomes possible at the “ripe moment”. Turkiye’s rapid progress is remarkable; yet the real test lies in how comprehensively the settlement is implemented.</p><p>Turkiye’s geographic position at the intersection of Europe, Asia and the Middle East makes its stability crucial for global energy security. Turkiye today stands at the centre of a broader geopolitical arc stretching from the Eastern Mediterranean through the Middle East to the Caucasus and the Black Sea, serving as a unique bridge of connectivity and power. The region surrounding Turkiye contains about 65 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its natural gas reserves.</p><p>Key energy corridors through Turkiye include the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP, delivering 16 billion cubic metres annually to Europe), TurkStream (31.5 billion cubic metres to southeastern Europe), and the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline (carrying 1.2 million barrels per day). This strategic position has also made these corridors prime targets for terrorist attacks.</p><p>Since the 1980s, the PKK has conducted over 60 major attacks on Turkiye’s critical energy infrastructure, causing multibillion-dollar losses and directly threatening European energy security. The Kirkuk–Ceyhan oil pipeline was sabotaged in 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2015, repeatedly disrupting crude oil flows to Mediterranean markets. In 2008, an attack on the BTC pipeline forced a complete shutdown for weeks, suspending a key Caspian oil corridor to Europe. The Baku–Tbilisi–Erzurum gas pipeline was hit in 2012 and 2015, exposing vulnerabilities in Europe’s natural gas supply. Even NATO’s fuel pipeline network was attacked in 2012 and 2017, demonstrating the strategic scale of the threat. As Europe works to secure energy routes, a terror-free Turkiye has become essential for European energy independence, requiring active cooperation from European and NATO allies.</p><p>Beyond energy, Turkiye continues to advance major projects that strengthen its position as a transportation corridor. The Development Road project, expected to carry 40 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2050, will link the Gulf to Europe through Turkiye and provide a faster, more cost-effective alternative to the Suez Canal. Moreover, the Middle Corridor already serves as a reliable land bridge, delivering 4.5 million tonnes of cargo in 2024 and projected to exceed 6 million in 2025.</p><p>Beyond efficiency, stability along these routes enhances investor confidence, strengthens Europe’s diversification strategy, and consolidates Turkiye’s role as a reliable energy and transportation hub uniting East and West. Consequently, a stable and terror-free Turkiye is pivotal not only for the regional economy but also for the global order.</p><p>The European Union welcomed the PKK’s dissolution as a significant opportunity, expressing its readiness to support the peace process. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, called it “one of the rare pieces of good news from the region,” while the European Parliament’s rapporteur on Turkiye, Nacho Sanchez Amor, described the peace call as a “historic step”.</p><p>The disbandment of the PKK – recognised as a terrorist organisation by both the EU and the United States – along with its proxies in Syria, namely the YPG and SDF, is expected to strengthen Turkiye’s democracy, help meet EU expectations, and accelerate the country’s accession process. For NATO, of which Turkiye is a longstanding southeastern anchor, acting in the spirit of alliance and upholding the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is essential. The broader international community should support this initiative and refrain from backing proxy structures that undermine it.</p><p>The foremost challenge is ensuring that all PKK members and affiliated groups fully comply with the dissolution process, especially by adhering to the March 10, 2025 agreement, under which YPG/SDF groups agreed to integrate into the Syrian Armed Forces and operate under Damascus’s authority. It is evident that failure to disarm and integrate would seriously undermine regional security, with direct consequences for Europe’s stability.</p><p>Another destabilising factor is Israel. Its continued support for the YPG/SDF jeopardises the dissolution process and fuels armed separatism along Turkiye’s borders. Beyond that, the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has shaken regional stability, while Israel has intensified its military actions in Syria and Lebanon, carried out operations in Iran, and launched strikes on targets in Tunisia, Yemen and even Qatar during ceasefire talks. These actions breach international law and threaten the fragile balance that is only now being restored. Israel’s continued aggression thus represents a major threat to the security of both the political and energy order.</p><p>Decades of chronic fear, pain and division could now give way to solidarity and prosperity. The road ahead will not be free of challenges, yet political unity, social cohesion, and international cooperation can turn this moment into a truly historic opportunity. A terror-free Turkiye safeguards vital energy and trade routes while offering a vision of regional confidence and shared progress.</p><p>This transformation carries profound implications for the region stretching from Europe to the Caucasus and the Middle East. By removing the threat of terror, disruption, and new waves of migration, Turkiye strengthens the reliability of the critical supply corridors on which Europe depends, attracts greater international investment in energy and logistics projects, and creates the conditions for its neighbours to build on stability rather than conflict. If pursued with determination, this path will pave the way for a future defined by a sustainable security architecture and lasting peace grounded in mutual benefit.</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Terror-free Turkiye: A homegrown peace reshaping the region","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/24/terror-free-turkiye-a-homegrown-peace-reshaping-the-region","message":""}
{"details":"<p>Sean “Diddy” Combs was transferred on Thursday to Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, to begin serving the rest of his sentence for prostitution-related charges, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Combs, who was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, requested he serve his 50-month (just over four-year) prison sentence at the Fort Dix facility to take advantage of its drug treatment program and to be close to his family.</p><p>The music mogul will serve about two and a half years at the federal prison. Up until now, he had been in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY since his arrest in September 2024 and during the course of his federal criminal trial earlier this year. Those 13 months will be shaved off the remainder of his sentence, in addition to any credit he receives for participating in drug treatment. His projected release date is May 8, 2028, according to the Bureau of Prisons.</p><p>Combs’ legal team is appealing his conviction and sentence, and this week asked a federal appeals court to set an expedited schedule.

The US, China, and Iran all signed but have not ratified the original treaty, while Russia withdrew its ratification in 2023.</p><p>Moscow carried out its last nuclear test in 1990 while still the Soviet Union, and China carried out its last nuclear test in 1996, according to the UN. The last nuclear test by the United Kingdom was in 1991, followed by the US in 1992 and France in 1996. North Korea is the only country that has carried out nuclear tests in the past two decades, with its last test in 2017.</p><p>Trevor Findlay, a nuclear security expert and honorary professional fellow at the University of Melbourne, told Al Jazeera that it was unclear what type of testing Trump was referring to in his post.</p><p>“My assumption is that he means missile launches of nuclear-capable missiles, as North Korea and Russia have been doing very publicly. These do not carry an actual nuclear warhead [but likely a dummy], nor do they create a nuclear explosion,” he said.</p><p>“The US already tests its own missiles periodically, both existing ones and ones in development, often splashing down in the Pacific. It does announce them but tends not to make a big deal of it, like North Korea and Russia,” he said.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, has called for the “total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme and says he does not want Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon.

They’ve constantly been saying they are not intending to make a nuclear bomb,” Panda told Al Jazeera. “The only thing that Iran has which might be taken seriously is some highly enriched uranium.

{"details":"<p>The rare move comes after mounting pressure to act over Andrew’s relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>By AP</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>King Charles III has stripped his brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after weeks of pressure to act over his relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Buckingham Palace said on Thursday the king “initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew”.</p><p>After the king’s rare move, Andrew will be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor and not as a prince, and he will move from his Royal Lodge residence into “private accommodation”.</p><p>It is almost unprecedented for a British prince or princess to be stripped of that title. It last happened in 1919, when Prince Ernest Augustus, who was a UK royal and also a prince of Hanover, had his British title removed for siding with Germany during World War I.</p><p>Demand had been growing on the palace to remove the prince from Royal Lodge after he surrendered his use of the title duke of York earlier this month over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, whose posthumous memoir hit bookstores last week.</p><p>But the king went even further to punish him for serious lapses of judgement by removing the title of prince that he had held since birth as a child of a monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Giuffre’s brother declared victory for his sister, who died in April at the age of 41.</p><p>“Today, an ordinary American girl from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage,” her brother Skye Roberts said in a statement.</p><p>Andrew faced a new round of public opprobrium after emails emerged earlier this month showing he had remained in contact with Epstein longer than he previously admitted.</p><p>That news was followed by the publication of, Nobody’s Girl, by Giuffre, who alleged she had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The book detailed three alleged sexual encounters with Andrew, who she said acted as if he believed “having sex with me was his birthright”.</p><p>Andrew, 65, has long denied Giuffre’s claims, but stepped down from royal duties after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he attempted to rebut her allegations.</p><p>Andrew paid millions in an out-of-court settlement in 2022 after Giuffre filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he did not admit wrongdoing, he acknowledged Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.</p><p>The move by the king means Andrew will no longer be a prince or be known as “his royal highness”, “duke of York”, “earl of Inverness” or “baron Killyleagh” – all titles he held until now. Also gone are honours that include Order of the Garter and status as knight grand cross of the Royal Victorian Order.</p><p>Andrew is expected to move to a property on the king’s Sandringham estate near the northeast coast and receive private financial support from his brother.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"King Charles III strips Prince Andrew of titles, evicts him from royal home","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/king-charles-iii-strips-prince-andrew-of-titles-evicts-him-from-royal-home","message":""}

Not money. Not even AI, but “culture.”</p><p>The layoff announcement ﻿this week was “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI driven, not right now. It’s culture,” Jassy said in response to an analyst question on the company’s earnings call Thursday. Amazon’s quarterly sales grew 13% year-on-year to $180 billion.</p><p>Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.”</p><p>Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings.</p><p>“It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.”</p><p>Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers.

The “sting” aimed to drive suspects into a forested hillside where special operation units were waiting to ambush them.</p><p>The following day, dozens of favela residents gathered in front of the state government headquarters shouting “assassins!” just hours after family members laid dozens of bodies out on a street in one of the targeted areas.</p><p>Among those expressing shock about the death toll was President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. According to Brazil’s justice minister, Lula was “astonished” that the federal government had not been informed about or asked to cooperate in the operation beforehand.</p><p>Arriving on foot and in armoured cars, police launched a predawn raid targeting the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) gang, one of Brazil’s oldest criminal organisations, in Rio’s northern neighbourhoods of Penha Complex and Alemao Complex.</p><p>The gang, which originated in Rio’s prisons in the 1970s, has expanded in recent years and now commands territory across Brazil, including in the Amazon. Its criminal activities include drug trafficking, arms trafficking and protection racketeering.</p><p>Tuesday’s assault involved 2,500 police and soldiers. Many were waiting in wooded areas – where most of the killings occurred – close to the targeted sites. Red Command fired back at the government forces, sparking scenes of chaos across the two neighbourhoods.</p><p>Schools in the affected areas were closed, a local university cancelled its classes and several roads were blocked off. Elsewhere, many shops in the two districts closed on Wednesday.</p><p>Rio state Governor Claudio Castro, a far-right ally of former President Jair Bolsonaro, said forensic work was still under way. For now, he maintained, the official death toll was 58, including four police officers.</p><p>However, the public defender’s office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, reported that the figure was actually 132.</p><p>After the raid, the state government said 118 weapons and more than a tonne of drugs were seized. On Wednesday, Castro called the operation a “success”. He spoke in a video on X and called the raid a “historic day in the fight against crime in Rio de Janeiro”.</p><p>Sigo acompanhando de perto esse dia histórico no combate à criminalidade no Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Acabo de tomar uma decisão importante para o nosso estado, que vai nos ajudar a definir os próximos passos nessa luta. pic.twitter.com/seFOP9JmIu</p><p>— Cláudio Castro (@claudiocastroRJ) October 28, 2025</p><p></p><p>Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Castro to provide information about the police operation and scheduled a hearing with the governor and the heads of the military and civil police on Monday in Rio.</p><p>On Wednesday, residents in Penha gathered next to dozens of bodies laid out in a square, shouting “justice!” before forensic authorities arrived to retrieve the remains.</p><p>Rafael Soares, a Brazilian crime journalist, told the BBC that Red Command had been on the offensive in Rio de Janeiro in recent years, reclaiming territory it had lost to its main rival, First Capital Command.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Police raids against criminal organisations are not uncommon in Brazil’s favelas and often turn deadly.</p><p>According to Soares, however, police operations in which more than 20 people die are “very rare” in Brazil. And most of those happen in Rio.</p><p>Before this, the city’s most deadly police raid occurred in 2021 when 29 people were killed in the Jacarezinho neighbourhood. In 2022 in another raid on the Alemao Complex involving 400 officers, helicopters and armoured vehicles, 19 people were killed.</p><p>And 111 prisoners were killed in Sao Paulo in 1992 when police stormed the Carandiru Penitentiary to quash a rebellion.</p><p>On a visit to the state of Ceara on Tuesday, Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski called the raid “very bloody” and offered his condolences to the families of those “innocent people” killed. He said Lula was “horrified” by the scale of the fatalities.</p><p>But the government will also be monitoring how the public responds. National violence is a key issue before national elections next year. Nearly 50 percent of Brazilians think security has deteriorated under Lula, according to a survey by Parana Pesquisas, a national pollster.</p><p>On Wednesday, Lula took to social media to say that organised crime in Brazil “continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence across cities”.</p><p>The previous day, opposition lawmakers accused the president of protecting criminal groups. “The traffickers’ president must be upset. He lost voters in Rio,” Gilvan da Federal told Congress, referring to gang members killed in the Rio de Janeiro operation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The brutality of this week’s raid has drawn criticism from Marta Hurtado, a spokesperson for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p>“We fully understand the challenges of having to deal with violent and well-organised groups such as Red Command,” she said.</p><p>But she also called on Brazil to “break this cycle of extreme brutality and ensure that law enforcement operations comply with international standards regarding the use of force”.</p><p>Cesar Munoz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called the deaths a “tragedy”. He added that “the succession of lethal operations that do not result in greater safety for the population but that in fact cause insecurity reveals the failure of the policies of Rio de Janeiro.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"More than 130 killed: How did a Brazil raid on a Rio favela turn so deadly?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/more-than-130-killed-how-did-a-brazil-raid-on-a-rio-favela-turn-so-deadly","message":""}
{"details":"<p>In Marseille, France’s most diverse city, a new wave of restaurants is redefining fine dining by blending haute cuisine with community solidarity.</p><p>Behind the ornate facade of Marseille restaurant Le République, lunch service is in full swing. Smoked mullet with sea fennel butter arrives as a starter, invoking the salty history of France's second city. Hay-smoked cheese with rice flour follows, singing with flavour from the surrounding Provençal countryside. Tourists and locals savour organic ingredients prepared by Michelin-starred chef Sébastien Richard.</p><p>But Le République is a gourmet restaurant with a few big differences. First, the staff include a recently released prisoner. Second, around 40% of diners will pay just €1 for their three-course feast. And, finally, several diners have never set foot inside a restaurant before.</p><p>Le République is a restaurant solidaire – one of around 10 in Marseille – run as a social enterprise in aid of community solidarity. Other examples include L'Après M, a former McDonald's taken over by its redundant staff when the franchise closed. The team purchased the premises and reopened it as a social enterprise, serving gourmet burgers created by a three-star Michelin chef served to the beat of Algerian rap, while operating a free food-delivery service of healthy takeout for people in need.</p><p>Marseille's newest restaurant solidaire is Chaleur, which opened in June 2025. When I visited, it was packed with patrons enjoying chilled cucumber soup adorned with clams, figs and roasted pumpkin seeds. A blowout lunch with wine costs around €25 (£21; $29). But if a patron explains that they're in a penurious position, they can enjoy the exact same menu for a tarif suspend – a \"suspended rate\" – of just €8 (£6.90; $9.29). Across Marseille, prices vary by philosophy. Some, like Le République, partner with charities to subsidise €1 meals, while others, like Chaleur, operate on trust.</p><p>Chaleur's popularity begs an obvious question: with food this tasty, why not make a profit?</p><p>\"Benevolence is a selfish way of saying that I want to be fulfilled in what I do,\" says Chaleur co-founder Raphaël Raynard. \"What enriches us is knowing our work is contributing to creating connections and helping people.\" The team regularly serves espressos to homeless neighbours and recently donated 300 meals to a workers' strike.</p><p>Chaleur's co-founder Nausicaa Roux believes Marseille's status as a \"lighthouse city\" is key to understanding the popularity of restaurants solidaires. Around 2,600 years of migration – including Greeks settlers in classical times to Iberian Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition and Armenians in the 20th Century – has made Marseille one of France's most diverse and religiously tolerant cities.</p><p>\"As a result, there's a real way of living together that I don't think exists in Paris or London,\" Roux said. \"Folks feel duty bound to help the one in five Marseillais who are born abroad. \"There is an openness not found in other cities in France.\"</p><p>These emigres didn't arrive empty handed. They carried ingredients like orange blossom water from the Middle East, which is used to make Marseille's iconic navette biscuits. Dates entered Europe via the Vieux Port, the city's ancient harbour, and probably tomatoes and bananas too. The dynamic city dialect includes words in Amazigh, Occitan and Italian, with phrases blending together like a linguistic bouillabaisse, the local fish stew made from imported saffron and regional seafood. Marseille is, quite literally, a global melting pot.</p><p>Thanks to Marseille's culinary history, food is Marseille's most powerful social tool. Few districts need it more than La Cabucelle, the city's former soap-making area, located high above the Vieux Port. Here, incomes hover around €975 (£849; $1131) per month – some €500 less than the Marseille average – and there's no youth centre or social space. That's why Léna Cardo opened her restaurant-daycare-social space Le Réfectoire, which started serving organic meals in April 2024.</p><p>Le Réfectoire's large, white-washed interior is a restaurant, library, nursery and information exchange rolled into one. \"Every Monday, we have a history teacher,\" says Cardo. \"She voluntarily gives up her time to teach French history to a dozen mums.\" Every Tuesday, a counsellor offers employment advice for free. \"We can be a place for a parent to learn French or a young adult to find a job.\"</p><p>However, what keeps customers coming back is Le Réfectoire's sublime food. Daily specials cost around €12, with recent offerings including a sea bream fillet on a bed of Provençal potatoes and tabbouleh topped with a goat's cheese galette. On Wednesdays, local chefs originally hailing from countries like Congo and Morocco take turns in the kitchen and share the revenue. Any excess profit is funnelled into local socio-cultural activities.</p><p>More like this:</p><p>• Is the future of French cheese at stake?</p><p>• Marseille: France's 'good natured' city</p><p>• The French Riviera's picture-perfect car-free island escape</p><p>Travellers are slowly discovering La Cabucelle, with its Moorish facades and Armenian churches. Everyday bar Monday, an epic Marché aux Puces (flea market) bustles with antiques, home clearance treasures and vintage Olympique de Marseille football jerseys. Cardo hopes they will book Le Réfectoire when they come. \"If you're buying something here,\" she says, \"you give money for activities to people who need them.\"</p><p>The walk from La Cabucelle to Marseille's rejuvenated docklands feels like a veritable world tour. E-scooters flit like barracudas through streets serving Tunisian lablabi soup and Comoran breadfruit crisps. An influencer could hook 1,000 followers with snapshots of Laotian spring rolls and staircases painted in colourful rainbows. In the docks themselves, ferries make nightly runs to Tangier, Tunis and Algiers, while container ships arrive from around the world.</p><p>Back at Le République, chefs are preparing evening starters like leek vinaigrette with a Parmesan biscuit and grated bottarga. Aside from serving €1 meals to diners in need of nutritious cuisine, the restaurant's central theme is \"insertion professionnelle\" – helping marginalised people back into work.</p><p>\"[We've employed] people with autism, single mothers who haven't been able to work for 20 years, people who can't read,\" says Sylvain Martin, who co-founded the restaurant with chef Sébastien Richard. \"We have had so many profiles that I can't list them all!\"</p><p>Some staff have come to Le République from Baumettes Prison, Marseille's toughest jail, where the last person in the Western world to be executed by guillotine took place in 1977. The prison is now home to Marseille's most curious restaurant solidaire, Les Beaux Mets, which translates as \"the beautiful dishes\" and is a play on the maximum security penitentiary's name. The fine-dining restaurant, open for lunch only, was created by the godfather of Marseille cuisine, Gérald Passedat (also the brains behind the L'Après M's gourmet burger) after learning that former offenders tended to return to crime in the absence of meaningful work.</p><p>\"Taking people from Baumettes is one of the hardest insertions we have,\" admits Martin. \"They say yes to anything until the judge is confident enough to release them.\" He says that some ex-prisoners fail to show up for work but the ones that apply themselves are \"very, very motivated\", having learnt teamwork and timekeeping skills behind bars. The prison confirmed that 75% of inmates who trained at the prison restaurant achieved employment or training upon release, thanks in large part to Le République.</p><p>The evening service at Le République ends with a turmeric-golden poached pear topped with tongue-numbing Sichuan pepper. There's an unspoken question at the caisse (counter): how can anyone enjoy a €1 dinner?</p><p>\"We have signed agreements with 100 charities who can book a meal at the price,\" explains Martin. All patrons receive their bill discreetly after dining together, ensuring dignity for those paying a reduced tariff.</p><p>And what if a diner games the system to bag a discount meal?</p><p>\"If you are selfish enough to cheat, then do it,\" says Martin. \"It's your problem every morning in front of the mirror.\"</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Originating in Topkapi Palace where it delighted Ottoman sultans, this delicacy has a surprising ingredient.</p><p>'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.</p><p>The Braai tradition in South Africa is more than just a BBQ, it's a phenomenon that ties the nation together.</p><p>Mangal 2, a fixture on the London food scene, is redefining Turkish cuisine in a city constantly evolving.</p><p>AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.</p><p>Food writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.</p><p>At Michelin-starred Semma, chef Vijay Kumar brings deeply personal dishes from his childhood to the plate.</p><p>At Icca, Japanese sushi master chef Kazushige Suzuki blends ancient methods with other cuisines.</p><p>As part of its mission, Silo uses a nose to tail and root to tip approach to cooking out of respect for nature.</p><p>The menu at the Icehotel, the world's first hotel made out of ice and snow, is served on plates of ice.</p><p>How this one simple mistake gave birth to the 50-billion-dollar US chicken industry.</p><p>London's Darjeeling Express is ground zero for chef Asma Khan, a champion of women's empowerment.</p><p>Foraging is one of Finland's favourite hobbies and an essential part of the culture.</p><p>Floating in the middle of a Norwegian fjord, Restaurant Iris takes diners on an 'experiential dining' journey.</p><p>Deniseea Taylor is a mixologist who teaches what she jokingly calls 'drunk Black History'.</p><p>Taste of China: How chef Andrew Wong takes diners on a culinary journey across China's provinces.</p><p>Reel takes you to Italy to explore how the world's rarest and most expensive ingredient ends up on our tables.</p><p>What we eat, it turns out, can have an impact on how well our memory works.</p><p>American baker and chef Nancy Silverton explains the difference between British and American scones.</p><p>A huge recall of frozen fruits is currently happening across the US due to contamination fears.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

It is really just an absolutely perfect environment.\"</p><p>There are two types of bats at Guestwick: Common Pipistrelles and Natterer's. They roost high up in the rafters.</p><p>The Pipistrelles emerge first, flying around for a few minutes, before squeezing out through minute gaps around the church door.</p><p>The Natterer's come out a little later, preferring to exit through small holes in the roof to get outside and find food.</p><p>Without the help of the specialist cameras, the bats are near impossible to spot, lost in the darkness.</p><p>About a third of the churches surveyed in the study had no idea that bats were living there.</p><p>But in others, their presence was much more noticeable.  Bats can be messy houseguests.</p><p>\"They're lovely, but they're problematic too,\" says Graeme Peart from St Margaret's Church, Saxlingham, just a few miles from Guestwick.</p><p>He's responsible for the upkeep of the church - and says the bats started to become a nuisance about 15 years ago.</p><p>\"There's the urine, the droppings,\" he says. \"One time there was a carpet leading up to the altar that became absolutely sodden with urine and droppings and had to be thrown away. They also destroyed the brass work.\"</p><p>Bats are legally protected in the UK, so it's generally not possible to remove them.</p><p>But the church has worked with the Bats in Churches team to find a solution - they've built a sealed-off loft conversion above the vestry.</p><p>Ecologist Phillip Parker sets up his ladder to show us inside.</p><p>\"The idea is that the bats that are in the main body of the church will live in here, rather than in the church itself,\" he explains.</p><p>It's kitted out with CCTV cameras, allowing the team to monitor the animal's behaviour.</p><p>\"What we have found is certain weeks during the year there'll be a hundred bats in here, and then suddenly they will disappear,\" says Parker.</p><p>\"We don't know where they go, but they disappear for about 10 days, and then they'll come back again. And without the CCTV, we never knew that.\"</p><p>A major construction project like this takes time, effort and money.</p><p>The new loft, and the continued monitoring of the bats, has cost about £50,000, funded through the Heritage Lottery Fund and other partners.</p><p>Diana Spencer says there are other less costly solutions and grants are on offer from the Bat Conservation Trust.</p><p>\"On a simple level, you can use sheets or covers over areas where things might be damaged.

There is a makeshift camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.</p><p>Mayor Richard Solomon described the conditions as devastating. “Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” he said.</p><p>Adding to the devastation, Solomon said the storm “wiped out” the town’s relief supplies and rendered emergency vehicles inoperable due to water damage. This delayed the authorities’ ability to deliver much-needed aid.</p><p>Dozens of residents were seen clearing out the shelves of a damaged supermarket out of desperation, taking basic needs such as food and water.</p><p>“There’s no looting,” a resident said to CNN. “This is trying to survive.

In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in el-Fasher,” she said. “There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Residents in the city were being subjected to “horrors” the United Nations’ humanitarian chief said.</p><p>The city was “already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, [but] has descended into an even darker hell,” Tom Fletcher told the UN Security Council.</p><p>There were “credible reports of widespread executions after Rapid Support Forces fighters entered the city”, Fletcher said.</p><p>“We cannot hear the screams, but – as we sit here today – the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people [are] being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>For 18 months before Sudan’s army withdrew from the city, an RSF siege had trapped hundreds of thousands of people inside without food or essentials.</p><p>More than 36,000 people have fled since Saturday, largely on foot, to Tawila, a town around 70km (43 miles) west that is already sheltering roughly 650,000 displaced people.</p><p>“There was a lot of shelling,” Fatima Abdulrahman, a woman displaced from el-Fasher, told Al Jazeera from Tawila. “I myself have been affected by shells. Shelling killed my daughter, injured my other daughter’s eye and paralysed my son. My body is full of wounds and is swollen.”</p><p>The fall of el-Fasher to the RSF could herald another split of Sudan, more than a decade after South Sudan’s creation.

{"details":"<p>Ever since I was a child I have loved wildflowers. I have fond memories of the woods in Sussex, where I grew up, filling with primroses early in the year and carpeted with bluebells in the spring.</p><p>I always used their nicknames - \"eggs and bacon\" for birds-foot-trefoil (a native plant known for its yellow slipper-like petals) and \"bread-and-cheese\" for the young shoots of the British tree hawthorn, which my friends and I would eat. And pretend to like!</p><p>We picked rosehips from hedges too, which we split open to make itching powder, perfect for playground pranks.</p><p>But later in life, on my walks through the countryside, I began to notice dwindling numbers of wildflowers. I missed the grasslands, bursting with colour, that I'd so enjoyed in my childhood.</p><p>According to the charity Plantlife, approximately 97% of wildflower meadows have been lost across the UK since the 1930s, while species-rich grassland areas, which used to be a common sight, are now among the most threatened habitats.</p><p>\"It's definitely a story of severe overall decline, both in the cover of flowers but also the diversity,\" explains Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University.</p><p>So, what will happen if there isn't more intervention to save wildflowers? What will the future look like?</p><p>\"Awful, in a word,\" says Prof Potts. \"If we, let's say, take a scenario where we just continue business as usual as we are now, we will still keep losing our wildflowers.</p><p>\"And with that, we lose the beneficial biodiversity like the pollinators and the natural enemies of pests.\"</p><p>As a bee lover I am on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow. Not just for the beautiful colours but for the vibrancy of the bees, butterflies and moths flying around, which need that habitat.</p><p>Yet since then, I've come to understand that the loss of wildflowers could bring - and the other perhaps more unexpected consequences too.</p><p>\"The consequence will be for farmers,\" argues Prof Potts. \"They will get low yields and poor quality crops, consumers will have to pay higher prices. Our environment will be degraded, eroded, will have less wildlife.</p><p>\"Many of them [wildflowers] produce nectar and pollen, which is super important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, that can pollinate crops.\"</p><p>Prof Daniel Gibbs, food security lead at the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, also has concerns about the long-term consequences.</p><p>\"Over time, and alongside pressures from climate change and land degradation, this could make our food system more fragile, and negatively impact food security,\" he says - meaning we could, for example, find ourselves with more limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p>There are also studies showing that fields near wildflower-rich margins or meadows produce better-quality fruit and higher yields.</p><p>\"Wildflowers can also support some bugs, like spiders and carabid beetles… [which] do an absolutely fantastic job in controlling some of the pests that we get on crops - that can either damage the crop or sometimes lower the quality of the produce,\" adds Prof Potts.</p><p>He describes wildflowers as almost like little factories, pumping out beneficial bits of biodiversity that can help with food production.</p><p>\"Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination,\" Prof Gibbs says. \"Or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices.\"</p><p>Multiple factors are behind the decline. Sarah Shuttleworth, a botanist with Plantlife, argues that certain intensive farming methods have contributed.</p><p>But some intensive farming methods have also allowed farmers to grow food for the country - and farmers I spoke to pointed out that they face tough financial choices.</p><p>Though there have been government subsidies in place for years, meaning farmers are paid by the government to support wildlife on their land, since Brexit the way these grants are paid has changed, with different schemes designed in each of the devolved nations.</p><p>In England, there has been frustration in some quarters about the speed and rollout of the grants and the fact that some schemes have been paused - such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), though this is due to reopen, while others extended at the last minute, leaving farmers less able to plan ahead.</p><p>Speaking about the SFI scheme, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told the BBC: \"We inherited farming schemes which were untargeted and underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses.</p><p>\"We have changed direction to ensure public money is spent effectively, and last year all the government's farming budget was spent.\"</p><p>They also acknowledged that wildflowers are vital, providing food and habitats for pollinators and wildlife, as well as improving biodiversity, and added: \"We are backing farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history and under our agri-environment schemes we are funding millions of hectares of wildflower meadows.\"</p><p>As part of its new deal for farmers, Defra said it has committed nearly £250m in farming grants to improve productivity, trial new technologies and drive innovation in the sector.</p><p>Mark Meadows, Warwickshire chair of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), maintains 6m (20ft) wildflower strips around many of his fields. He feared that without an extension to his current agreement with Defra he'd have to return some wildflower margins to crop production.</p><p>\"I'd love [to] be profitable enough [to] say 'Look, we'll leave 5% of our farmland,'… but agricultural costs have gone up a lot,\" he says.</p><p>Other farmers share similar tales. David Lord is a third-generation farmer in Essex and member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network.</p><p>\"I'm 47 and I've never known farming to be under so much strain,\" he says.</p><p>Knowing what funding for nature recovery on farms will be in place in future years is, he says, crucial. \"It takes time and care and cost to maintain [wildflowers]... A lot of farmers aren't going to be minded to just keep these habitats in place without the funding.\"</p><p>There are some glimmers of hope.</p><p>Prof Potts says there has at least been a slowdown in decline over the last couple of decades - and perhaps a limited recovery for some species.</p><p>\"I think [this] reflects some of the agricultural practices that have been a bit more nature-friendly.\"</p><p>Nature writer, and author of Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, agrees that the decline in wildflowers is far from universal.</p><p>Certain species such as cow parsley, yarrow and knapweed are in fact spreading, and he welcomes an influx of non-native plants and \"garden escapes\", such as snowdrop and buddleia.</p><p>Even so, Prof Potts says: \"It is the most precious things that we're losing the most of.\" This includes cornflowers, corncockle and corn marigold - what he terms the iconic British countryside flowers.</p><p>And the overall decline is why my husband and I decided to create our own wildflower meadow from an overgrown arable field.</p><p>There was a field next to our house, which I had put beehives in, with permission from the owner. I had often thought it would be wonderful to create a wildflower meadow around those hives, so when the opportunity arose to buy the field, we decided to go ahead.</p><p>A conservation specialist advised us on where to buy the seed. It was particularly important to get some yellow rattle seed, which helps keep more dominant grasses in check. This in turn gives other wildflowers more opportunity to gain a foothold.</p><p>Our first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field. The red was from poppies which came from the disturbed ground. The white was ox-eye daisies, bladder campion and wild carrot, with spires of bright blue from viper's bugloss.</p><p>The colour has changed over time - the splash of red did not return, but different wildflowers arrived in their place.</p><p>The most spectacular year was last summer. Orchid seeds I'd scattered many years before and almost forgotten about, managed to flower. We counted more than 100 bee orchids — which to a bee lover like me, was the climax of years of work.</p><p>In fairness, I should admit it's years of my husband Chris's work. He found an old-fashioned seed fiddle for us to use — a hand-held device used to scatter the seeds in a controlled way, operated as though drawing a bow across a violin.</p><p>He also cut the hay at the end of summer, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but ultimately finding a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way.</p><p>Of course, many people are not in the fortunate position we found ourselves in, of being able to create a wildflower meadow. And in the UK, you cannot plant wildflowers just anywhere — you would most likely need the landowner's permission.</p><p>But growing numbers of people are trying to create their own patches of wildflowers. Plantlife reports that more and more are joining its No Mow May initiative —  an annual campaign to let wildflowers grow freely, by packing away the lawnmower.</p><p>Sarah Shuttleworth says just a small spot can make a difference, especially when it comes to pollinators. \"Anyone who has a patch of grass could do their bit… the idea is that you're recreating a meadow-type management scheme, but in a very, very micro scale.\"</p><p>The charity would like to see wildflower habitats being given the same kind of protection as other precious landscapes. Meanwhile Prof Potts thinks, \"We need a bit more of a radical think about how to support farmers to do the right thing.\"</p><p>New housing developments could also prove a way to create wildflower meadows. Under the government's Biodiversity Net Gain scheme, set up under the Environment Act, developers creating building sites are obliged to ensure the same amount of biodiversity at the end of the project, as they had at the start, plus 10%.</p><p>Ben Taylor manages the Iford Estate, farming land near Lewes in Sussex. For a recording of Open Country on Radio 4, he showed me with great pride around a new wildflower meadow, which was part of a 90-acre site, funded as a pilot by the scheme.</p><p>\"We have seen hares here now, which we never had a year or two ago, before we started doing this. So it's really exciting...\"</p><p>But, I wondered, does it make sense to take all of those acres of land out of food production?</p><p>Mr Taylor says the soil was poor there anyway. \"You have to have nature to be able to grow food,\" he adds. \"Because you need the pollinators as you need the ecosystem, the food chains, the soil webs and everything else to be able to grow food sustainably in the long-term - so I like to think of it as a reservoir of biodiversity.\"</p><p>Many ecologists also want us to look beyond the benefits the wildflowers provide for us.</p><p>\"Those species are just valuable in their own right, regardless of what they do or what they provide… They've also got their own right to be,\" argues Dr Kelly Hemmings, associate professor in ecology at the Royal Agricultural University.</p><p>Richard Mabey stresses a similar point. \"They are important, in my view, for ethical reasons, simply because they exist.</p><p>\"Beyond that they are the infrastructure of all other life on the Earth, the fundamental base of the food chain.\"</p><p>Top picture credit: Getty Images</p><p>BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The Senate requires a supermajority – 60 of the chamber’s 100 members – to overcome a filibuster and pass most legislation.</p><p>Senate rules, including the filibuster, can be changed by a simple majority vote at any time.

The fact is, in flying back, I thought a great deal about that question, WHY?” he wrote.</p><p>The US leader continued that he believed that should the Democrats come back into power, they would “exercise their rights” and end the filibuster on the “first day they take office”.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Trump calls for Senate to scrap filibuster tactic to end the gov’t shutdown","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/trump-calls-for-senate-to-scrap-filibuster-tactic-to-end-the-govt-shutdown","message":""}

The group, which tracks the country’s civil war, described the situation as “a true genocide”.</p><p>“The massacres the world is witnessing today are an extension of what occurred in el-Fasher more than a year and a half ago, when over 14,000 civilians were killed through bombing, starvation, and extrajudicial executions,” the group said.</p><p>It said the attacks are being carried out as part of a “deliberate and systematic campaign of killing and extermination”.</p><p>The statement comes as new evidence of mass killings in the strategic area has emerged from Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), which reported that satellite imagery of el-Fasher, taken after the RSF moved in, shows clusters of objects consistent with the size of human bodies, as well as large areas of red discolouration on the ground.</p><p>The RSF has been locked in a bloody civil war with Sudan’s army since 2023, in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced more than 12 million people.</p><p>The paramilitary force overran el-Fasher, the army’s last stronghold in Darfur, on Sunday after 17 months of siege.</p><p>The Sudanese government said on Wednesday that at least 2,000 people have been killed in the city since then, while aid agencies say they have received credible reports of atrocities, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, and house-to-house raids.</p><p>Sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, was also reported in the city, they said.</p><p>El-Fasher’s fall puts the RSF in near full control of the vast region of Darfur and has raised concerns of another split of Sudan, more than a decade after South Sudan’s creation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Sudan’s army-aligned government also accused the RSF on Wednesday of attacking civilians in mosques during their recent takeover of the city.</p><p>“More than 2,000 civilians were killed during the militia’s invasion of el-Fasher, targeting volunteers in mosques and the Red Crescent,” Mona Nour Al-Daem, a humanitarian aid officer for the Sudanese government, said.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, said videos on social media taken by the RSF showed fighters “shooting at civilians attempting to flee”.</p><p>“The latest and most disturbing video to surface was of the fighters roaming through what has been identified as the Saudi Hospital in the city of el-Fasher, executing patients,” Morgan said.</p><p>Survivors who fled the city said at least 500 people had been seeking refuge in the hospital.</p><p>Among those killed were health workers, Morgan added.</p><p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said that more than 460 people were killed at the Saudi Maternity Hospital.</p><p>He said the WHO was “appalled and deeply shocked” by the reports.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network said RSF fighters on Tuesday “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards”.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Jordan have condemned the abuses committed by the RSF in Sudan.</p><p>Saudi Arabia expressed “deep concern” over grave human rights violations and urged the RSF to protect civilians.

Qatar also denounced the “horrific violations” and called for negotiations to end the conflict.</p><p>Egypt, Turkiye and Qatar reaffirmed their support for Sudan’s unity and sovereignty. Jordan likewise condemned the violence and called for restraint and an urgent ceasefire to protect civilians.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The RSF has not addressed the allegations against it.</p><p>The paramilitary force grew out of the notorious government-linked militia known as the Janjaweed, which carried out genocide during the Darfur conflict in the 2000s. The United States has also declared that the RSF and its allies have committed genocide in the current war.</p><p>Separately on Tuesday, Yale’s HRL published a report relying on satellite imagery that said that RSF forces were “conducting alleged mass killings” after seizing el-Fasher.</p><p>Nathaniel Raymond, HRL’s executive director, described the violence in el-Fasher as unprecedented.</p><p>“The scale is immense, from the earthen berm, the wall that now surrounds el-Fasher, to specific neighbourhoods, such as Daraja Oula, to hospitals and humanitarian facilities. We are seeing objects that measure between 1.5 to 2 metres [5 to 6.5 feet], which is the standard length of a human body, lying horizontal, as seen in satellite imagery at high resolution,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Those objects were not there 36 to 48 hours ago. They now litter the city.”</p><p>The researcher warned that the killings were a preview of what could happen in other areas of Darfur and the North Kordofan province as RSF forces move to the east of the country with the fall of el-Fasher.</p><p>Ahmed Ibrahim, a former staffer of the transitional government under Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, said the RSF was meant to be integrated into the national army, but due to “geopolitical” reasons and “internal politics”, this did not happen.</p><p>“Many bets were on the RSF militia to take over the resources of the country and replace the national army and take over the whole country,” Ibrahim told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The timeline of this integration, and the RSF’s new leadership, were the main “points of contention that led to this war”, he said.</p><p>According to Ibrahim, the war has been taking place as Sudan’s “rare earth minerals and long [Red] sea line” were being utilised to export livestock and other resources to East African countries as an attempt to “strip Sudan of its national resources”.</p><p>“This is not just a power struggle between two generals,” Ibrahim said. “This is part of a geopolitical attempt to restructure the region.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"‘A true genocide’: RSF kills ‘at least 1,500 people’ in Sudan’s el-Fasher","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/horrific-violations-arab-nations-slam-rsf-killings-in-sudans-el-fasher","message":""}

Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Read more</p><p>BOSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Boston on Thursday said it appeared to her that President Donald Trump's administration cannot legally suspend all food aid for millions of Americans amid the ongoing government shutdown as it plans to do starting Saturday.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said she planned to decide later on Thursday whether she should force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use some of the $5.25 billion in contingency funds it has on hand to pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.</p><p>Lawyers for 25 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia during an hour-long hearing asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order that would ensure the government at least partially funds the SNAP benefits, which 42 million Americans rely upon.</p><p>The USDA has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits, which cost $8.5 billion to $9 billion per month. Justice Department attorney Jason Altabet told the judge that USDA lacked the authority to disburse any funds for the benefits until Congress passes a spending bill ending the shutdown that began October 1.</p><p>But Talwani, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, questioned how the administration came to conclude it could pay out nothing at all when Congress provided the USDA with contingency funds it still has available in case of an emergency.</p><p>\"It's hard for me to understand how this isn't an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,\" she said.</p><p>The judge said Congress and USDA's own regulations instead appeared to intend for the agency to \"tighten belts\" if, for the first time in the SNAP program's history, it could no longer fully fund benefits for nearly 42 million low-income Americans.</p><p>\"We're not going to make everyone drop dead because it’s a political game,\" she said.</p><p>The USDA's shutdown plan, released last month, had said contingency funds were available to keep funding SNAP benefits in the event Congress did not enact spending legislation that would avert the lapse in funding that began October 1.</p><p>But on Saturday the department updated its website to say no benefits would be issued on November 1 as scheduled, stating \"the well has run dry,\" prompting the states to sue on Tuesday.</p><p>SNAP benefits are available to Americans whose income is less than 130% of the federal poverty line, or $1,632 a month for a one-person household, or $2,215 for a two-person household in many areas. States are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the benefits, which are paid out monthly.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress have traded blame for the shutdown and for the risk that SNAP benefits could lapse as the funding impasse continues.</p><p>But the states, led by Massachusetts, California, Arizona and Minnesota, say the lapse is unnecessary given the existence of the contingency funds, which would cover a portion of the benefits and by law are intended to be used as “necessary to carry out program operations.\"</p><p>“Millions of Americans are going to lose benefits they’ve had for decades,\" Michelle Pascucci, a lawyer with the Massachusetts attorney general's office, said during the hearing.</p><p>She argued that USDA lacks the discretion to stop funding benefits absent a complete lack of funding and by law must continue paying out as long as Congress has appropriated funds that can be used for those purposes, even if it could only make a partial distribution.</p><p>Altabet, the Justice Department attorney, warned that a ruling in the states' favor would result in an operationally fraught situation for USDA, saying officials were \"legitimately scared\" if the antiquated systems some states use could handle an unprecedented partial benefits distribution.</p><p>\"The agency thinks it would be catastrophic,\" he said.</p><p>While the temporary restraining order the states had proposed would only apply to them, Talwani said that the way the law governing SNAP worked, any decision she issued would have a national impact as benefits cannot be reduced based on where people live or \"what political party they are.\"</p><p>\"I can’t consider this in only the terms of half the nation,\" she said.</p>","headline":"US judge skeptical Trump administration can legally suspend food benefits","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/states-urge-us-judge-block-trump-administration-suspending-food-benefits-2025-10-30/","message":""}

{"details":"<p>An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.</p><p>The apparent killing – captured on video shared online by the rebels themselves – took place at a university medical school in El Fasher in Sudan’s western Darfur region after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took over the city on Sunday.</p><p>CNN has identified the location of the massacre as El Fasher University’s School of Medical Laboratory Science, just across the street from the Saudi Hospital where, according to reports cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, more than 460 people were also killed.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network, a professional organization, said the RSF “cold-bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present in the wards.”</p><p>Satellite images of the Saudi Hospital show signs of a massacre, with apparent clusters of bodies and blood-stained ground clearly visible.</p><p>Reports of RSF fighters committing large-scale massacres began to emerge within hours of the Sudanese military’s withdrawal from El Fasher earlier this week.</p><p>Those accounts have been corroborated by mounting evidence that includes videos and photos from the ground, survivor testimonies and satellite images.</p><p>RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, acknowledged Wednesday that there had been “violations” in El Fasher, and said an investigative committee would be launched to investigate and “hold accountable any soldier or any officer who committed a crime.”</p><p>In a separate statement, the RSF denied claims of killings at the hospital, describing them as “fabricated narratives with no connection to reality,” despite mounting evidence of atrocities.</p><p>The grisly events in El Fasher come over two and a half years into a brutal civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people.</p><p>On one side is Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s military ruler and the head of the Sudanese armed forces (SAF); on the other is Hemedti, the RSF chief and onetime al-Burhan deputy. The two men launched a coup together in 2021 before a power struggle between them descended into all-out war in 2023.</p><p>The United Nations and the United States have both said the RSF and the SAF have committed war crimes and have faced western sanctions.</p><p>The UN told CNN it believes about 120,000 people, half of them children, were trapped in El Fasher, which was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in Darfur and had been under siege by the RSF for 18 months.</p><p>Earlier this year, then US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during the Biden administration, accused the RSF of committing genocide against non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, saying there was evidence the group systematically murdered “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis” and that it “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence.”</p><p>Few eyewitness testimonies have emerged from El Fasher since its fall to the RSF. But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.</p><p>Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.</p><p>Most of the videos appear to have been filmed and shared by the rebels themselves.</p><p>One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.</p><p>The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.</p><p>Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.</p><p>Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.</p><p>Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”</p><p>Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.</p><p>CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.</p><p>Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.</p><p>The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.</p><p>The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.</p><p>“The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.</p><p>“So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.</p><p>Survivors fleeing the violence have told aid groups of summary executions and mass killings.</p><p>Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”</p><p>“(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.</p><p>A report from Yale Humanitarian Research Lab shows satellite images revealing mounting evidence of possible war crimes in Sudan as the RSF takes control of El Fasher in the Darfur region. CNN’s Nada Bashir reports.</p><p>Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.</p><p>“On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.</p><p>In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.</p><p>Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.</p><p>“All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.</p><p>“It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.</p><p>The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the Russian paramilitary group Wagner.</p><p>The Sudanese government has also accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the group. The UAE has repeatedly denied the accusation, despite an expert panel appointed by the UN Security Council finding in a January 2024 report that the allegations were “credible.”</p><p>The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”</p><p>Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”</p><p>“Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.</p><p>Hehenkamp spent several weeks at Tawila, providing help to people fleeing.</p><p>“The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.</p><p>Lanino told CNN that some 5,000 people managed to reach his team in Tawila in recent days.</p><p>“The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.</p><p>Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.</p><p>He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.</p><p>Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.</p><p>“(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network said that six medical staff, including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse, have been kidnapped by RSF fighters who are now demanding 100 million Sudanese pounds ($166,000) for each of them.</p><p>The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.</p><p>As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.</p><p>Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”</p><p>“We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.</p><p>CNN’s Allegra Goodwin, Avery Schmitz and Eyad Kourdi contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

{"details":"<p>By Stephen Nellis,  Akash Sriram and Kenrick Cai</p><p>WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab Chief Executive Tim Cook on Thursday gave forecasts for holiday quarter iPhone sales and overall revenue that surpass Wall Street expectations, powered by orders for iPhone 17 models that the company is racing to fulfill amid continuing supply constraints.</p><p>The constraints, as well as delays in shipping new phones to China, led Apple to miss iPhone sales forecasts in the fiscal fourth quarter, although the shortfall was made up for by strength in other areas such as new AirPods that use AI to translate languages, and profit topped Wall Street targets.</p><p>Apple shares rose 3.7% in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p><p>The results showed that the biggest risks many investors saw to Apple's business - its exposure to U.S.-China trade tensions and its lag in rolling out AI features - played a smaller role than the complexity of building and shipping hundreds of millions of devices.</p><p>In an interview with Reuters, Cook said he expects iPhone sales in the current, holiday-focused quarter to grow by double digits year over year and Apple's overall revenue to grow 10-12% year over year. Those forecasts for Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2026 beat analyst estimates of iPhone sales rising 9.8% to $75.91 billion and total sales up 6.6% to $132.53 billion, according to data from LSEG.</p><p>The outlook comes as Cook said the company struggled to meet demand for several iPhone 17 models and some older iPhone 16 models during its just-ended fiscal fourth quarter. The company also faced delays in China launching its iPhone Air model, the thinnest it has ever created and its biggest iPhone design overhaul in years.</p><p>Cook told Reuters that the China delay was the \"primary reason\" that sales contracted there during the fiscal fourth quarter.</p><p>\"However, we're very enthusiastic about China,\" he said. \"We love the response to the new products there, and we expect to grow or to return to growth in Q1.\"</p><p>Cook said Apple is still working to resolve some of the supply constraints.</p><p>\"Currently in Q1, we're experiencing supply constraints still on several models of the iPhone 17, and we're filling orders just as fast as we can,\" Cook said. \"It's a good problem to have.\"</p><p>[1/3]A person points to an iPhone during Apple's event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 9, 2025. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>Among the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, Apple's share gains have trailed those of its rivals this year as investors wait to see whether it can catch up with artificial intelligence features. The company has said its biggest updates to Siri, its virtual assistant, will come next year, and Cook told Reuters that Apple is \"making good progress\" on those upgrades.</p><p>“The expectation of a strong holiday quarter gives Apple a runway to reaffirm demand, but it will be interesting to see how effectively it converts that momentum into a durable AI and infrastructure advantage,” said Natalie Hwang, founding managing partner of Apeira Capital.</p><p>Apple's reliance on hardware sales has also left it with greater exposure to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Apple executives on Thursday reported tariff-related costs of $1.1 billion, in line with their forecast three months earlier. Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said he expects $1.4 billion in tariff-related costs in the current quarter ending in December, which would put gross margins at 47-48%. Wall Street on average expects gross margins of 46.9%, according to LSEG data.</p><p>Apple is hoping that its new iPhone Air - a possible precursor to a folding phone - along with more powerful iPhone Pro models and improved base iPhone models - will boost sales.</p><p>Apple's fiscal fourth quarter is typically its slowest sales period as consumers wind down buying older iPhone models and await the launch of new ones. Apple’s new models began shipping to most markets on September 19, so the quarter includes only limited sales from the recently launched devices.</p><p>Sales and profit for the quarter ended September 27 were $102.47 billion and $1.85 per share, compared with analyst expectations of $102.26 billion and $1.77 per share, according to LSEG data.

{"details":"<p>In land-starved Hong Kong a tiny, no-frills apartment far from the city center can eat up half of a monthly salary. But for bold renters there’s one sure way to get a discount: choose a property haunted by a murder or unnatural death.</p><p>The houses, often apartments inside the city’s tall residential buildings, strike so much fear among residents that anyone willing to live there can negotiate hefty discounts in one of the world’s most expensive property markets.</p><p>“The discount could be massive and many people who don’t mind can rent these places below the market price” said Ng Goon-lau, an investor so well-known for owning dozens of these apartments that local media has dubbed him the “King of Haunted Houses.”</p><p>Lists of haunted houses can be found on most estate agent websites. They are places where an unnatural or premature death has occurred and include the scenes of some of the city’s most gruesome murders.</p><p>Property-listing website Spacious.hk compiles a 92-page list that dates back to 2006, featuring details of how each death occurred. In a city known for its tightly packed residential towers, many entries state the cause of death as “fell from height.”</p><p>Other real estate agencies offer advice about how to identify spooky apartments, including checking death certificates and quizzing potential neighbors about the apartment’s history.</p><p>In cramped, sweaty Hong Kong, climate change is making things worse for the poorest</p><p>In a city heavily influenced by Buddhism and Taoism, living in apartments associated with ghastly deaths often stokes fear of bad fortune.</p><p>Feng shui master Andrew Kwan said people believe that those who died a tragic death may not get closure. “Their hatred may stay. (Their spirit) may remain in the apartment,” he said.</p><p>The fear of a curse has created a unique market for bargain-hunting investors and tenants who are happy to try their luck.</p><p>Property prices plunge by an average of 20% after they are labelled haunted – and up to 34% in the event of a murder, according to Utpal Bhattacharya, Chair Professor of Finance at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who led a study on the phenomena in 2019.</p><p>A ripple effect spreads to properties on the same floor, which often see their value drop 10%, and even flats in the same building can fall 7%, he told CNN.</p><p>“The belief in Feng Shui is quite strong among Chinese, and the population in Hong Kong is about 94% Chinese…implying that most buyers have a large distaste for haunted houses,” said Bhattacharya.</p><p>Disclosure is not required under Hong Kong law, but regulators demand property agents provide accurate information about any death upon inquiry.</p><p>These details matter because the circumstance of the death – from accidents to malicious murders – could determine the size of the discount.</p><p>In death, Ng, a veteran investor in his 70s, sees opportunity. He scoops up the so-called haunted homes from owners who are desperate to sell, and leases them out at up to 30% below market price.</p><p>“Many people don’t actually have a strong feeling against hung zaats. It all comes down to the extent of the discount,” he said.</p><p>Still, the prevailing mood of the city is to stay away – or at least be cautious.</p><p>That especially applies to properties linked to some of the city’s most chilling murder cases.</p><p>In 2014, British banker Rurik Jutting brutally murdered two Indonesian women and hid one of the bodies in a suitcase in his upscale apartment in J Residence in Wan Chai, a popular nightlife district in Hong Kong.</p><p>As gruesome details of the murders emerged, the value of the one-bedroom apartment where they took place was estimated to have plunged from $1.16 million to $770,000, with its $3,740 monthly rental halved, Bloomberg reported at the time.</p><p>Another unit in Tsuen Wan, a residential neighborhood in the New Territories, was sold at a loss of $142,000, shaving 40% off the original price, according to local news reports. The unit was the scene of a money-fueled murder in 2016 involving three men, who killed their friend and sealed his body in a slab of cement stored in the unit.</p><p>Owners of the properties are almost certain to lose money. It’s very difficult to find a buyer for homes listed as a haunted house – partly because banks also tend to stay away.</p><p>Eric Pau, Senior Associate Director at Ricacorp Properties, a major real estate firm in Hong Kong, told CNN many banks view them as high-risk investments. “In most cases, mortgages will not be granted,” he said.</p><p>But he said others see it as an opportunity. As an investor, Ng’s playbook is to be selective about the type of “haunted homes” he buys.</p><p>He tries to avoid properties associated with gruesome murders as much as possible and looks for places where the death occurred some time ago.</p><p>“Fortunately, some ‘haunted houses’ have been around for so long that people have forgotten about what happened,” he said. “The main thing is to make people not to feel sad and unpleasant.”</p><p>But like all investments, there are risks, and Ng has had some spooky failures.</p><p>One time, he said, a tenant broke the lease just days after moving in. The tenant never told him why, so he turned to the neighbors.</p><p>“The neighbors told me that the three-year-old son of this tenant opened a very difficult book in the middle of the night and read it attentively,” Ng recalled being told.</p><p>“He thought his son was possessed,” he said.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

Companies, including Amazon, are introducing AI into nearly every facet of their operations in hopes of reducing costs and boosting productivity.</p><p>On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he did not believe the AI boom is a speculative bubble like the dot-com era, when many companies were \"ideas rather than businesses.\" Today’s AI leaders “actually have earnings,\" he said. He added that AI investments - especially in data centers, chips, and infrastructure - were a major source of economic growth. He did warn about AI's impact on the labor market.</p><p>AWS typically accounts for a little more than 15% of Amazon's total revenue, but the segment is a huge profit engine, making up roughly 60% of the company's total operating income.

{"details":"<p>While the women accused in the infamous Salem witch trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.</p><p>Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.</p><p>Between 1560 and 1700, more than 500 women were tried for witchcraft in the southeast region, according to UK Parliament estimates. Of those, 112 were executed.</p><p>But one trial in Maidstone, Kent, in 1652 stands out for its scale and public fascination.</p><p>On July 30 that year, a court convened near where Maidstone Town Hall stands today. Thirty-two people faced charges ranging from theft and murder to witchcraft, Claire Kehily, councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. Six women, accused of bewitching to death a 10-day-old infant, her mother, and a 3-year-old child, became the focus of the town’s attention, she said.</p><p>In the summer of 1652, the town was “abuzz with excitement,” Kehily explained.  “People came down from London to witness what was going on. It was the biggest thing we’d had here for a long time.”</p><p>The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.</p><p>The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.</p><p>The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”</p><p>Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”</p><p>Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.</p><p>All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.</p><p>Their execution took place at Penenden Heath, now a tranquil park with soccer fields and woodland.</p><p>“They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”</p><p>“These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”</p><p>Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.</p><p>“There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”</p><p>After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.</p><p>A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.</p><p>Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.</p><p>Now, nearly 400 years later, Maidstone Borough Council is calling for change.</p><p>Stuart Jeffery, leader of the council, has written to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, urging the British government to introduce legislation that would grant a general pardon to those executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1562, including the women hanged at Penenden Heath in 1652.</p><p>“Justice is timeless,” said Harwood. “These terrible wrongs carried out between 1542 and the mid-18th century echo through the ages. They cannot just be painted over.”</p><p>“We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”</p><p>Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”</p><p>“By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.</p><p>“To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”</p><p>Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.</p><p>In Scotland, then-First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology in 2022 to the thousands of people – mostly women – who were accused and executed under the country’s Witchcraft Act between the 16th and 18th centuries. The apology came after a sustained campaign by historians and activists who argued that the victims were persecuted for being poor, vulnerable, or simply different.</p><p>There is also precedent for legislative pardons.</p><p>In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker convicted under laws criminalizing homosexuality, and in 2017 the UK government extended the pardon to thousands of other gay and bisexual men convicted under similar statutes. Known as the “Turing Law,” it marked a significant step in acknowledging the injustice of discriminatory legislation.</p><p>Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.</p><p>“This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”</p><p>A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Even though she had already been traveling for six years pursuing ghosts, it was a tour of an 1821 building in Savannah, Georgia, that left registered nurse Ashley Wiseman scared to tears.</p><p>During an organized ghost-hunt weekend in 2018, the 41-year-old Connecticut resident was already feeling uncomfortable during the group’s exploration in the city’s historic downtown of the building that housed the Moon River Brewing Company, which has since closed. But it was when she reached the second floor of the building, which was once home to the City Hotel, that she says she heard disembodied footsteps behind her, followed by a glimpse of “what appeared to be a haggard — nearly ancient — old woman,” she remembers.</p><p>When she caught a glimpse of a separate shadowy figure in the corner, she says she knew “something was brewing.” The sighting was almost immediately followed by what Wiseman describes as a featureless “dark, mad mass of energy” that rushed through a doorway with what she thinks was an intent to harm others.</p><p>“Remember, I’m a woman of science, [but] it scared me so badly, I cried later,” says the 13-year veteran nurse. Despite the fright, Wiseman has continued her pursuits into the strange and unusual, and estimates she has spent well over $100,000 since 2012 on approximately 80 trips revolving around ghosts.</p><p>Wiseman is not alone in her enthusiasm for this experience. She is a paranormal tourist, a member of an unofficial club of “spooky explorers,” as they are colloquially called. These travelers are not content with taking a two-hour ghost tour when they visit a city, but instead plan entire vacations, spending not-insignificant amounts of money, for a chance to encounter the unexplained — and maybe even get the bejesus scared out of them.</p><p>Since the rise of unscripted paranormal TV shows in the early 2000s and the proliferation of paranormal-themed YouTube channels and podcasts, ghosts have become good for business. And the locations are not all desolate cobweb-ridden buildings, but include nicely appointed hotel stays, such as The Stanley (aka the hotel that inspired Stephen King’s novel, “The Shining”) in Estes Park, Colorado, or The Lord Baltimore Hotel, in Maryland — site of at least 20 deaths during the Great Depression and reputed to be home of a little girl ghost called “Molly.”</p><p>There are myriad appeals for these travelers, ranging from the opportunity to connect with “the other side” to mingling with like-minded folks, or pursuing the exhilaration of a scare at a notoriously haunted spot.</p><p>“It’s my thrill-seeking behavior,” says Wiseman, whose ghost-hunting outings have included a visit to historic Rhodes Hall in Atlanta.</p><p>She has been joined by her mother on some excursions and also met a boyfriend on one in Ireland.</p><p>“I won’t jump out of airplanes or ski down mountains, but I will investigate the paranormal; it gives me the biggest rush,” she adds.</p><p>“You’re sitting there in the dark with friends, and maybe nothing is going on, then suddenly a light flickers, you hear a whisper that shouldn’t be there, your heart beats a little faster, and you’re waiting for something to happen — wanting it to.”</p><p>David and Alysia Leonhardt, 52 and 49, respectively, are accountants from Robbinsdale, Minnesota, and have traveled to more than 30 haunted locations since 2013.</p><p>At the beginning of their “paranormal escapades,” David says that the couple was looking for new travel experiences as their kids got older. Over time, paranormal tourism hooked them.</p><p>The Leonhardts drive to destinations across the United States, spending approximately $5,000 yearly on travel expenses, as well as paranormal equipment.</p><p>Some particularly creepy locales have even inspired repeat visits.</p><p>In 2020, during a whirlwind investigation of six haunted sites spanning 10 days, David and Alysia stayed overnight at the Farrar School in Maxwell, Iowa.</p><p>One of the hauntings that has been reported at the landmark, recently purchased by paranormal YouTube sensations “Sam and Colby” (Samuel Golbach and Colby Brock), is a large and aggressive shadow figure known as “The Principal.” The night of their visit, David says he wondered if they encountered him.</p><p>They heard a spectral whistle emanating through the building, then witnessed a door violently shaking without anything visible acting upon it. He says it was a “huge factor” in several return visits to Farrar throughout the years.</p><p>This excitement of the ghost hunt, which hooks paranormal tourists and keeps them returning, is a recurring theme among these travelers.</p><p>Paul Roberts, 56, of Mandeville, Louisiana, has explored the ghosts of the Warner Grand Theatre in San Pedro, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, nine times. He says he’s found the “energies” there to be generous and open to him. That wasn’t the case when he spent a night at the historic Gold Hill Hotel and Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Roberts was staying in the Miner’s Cabin, located near the wooden headframe above the entrance to the Yellow Jacket Mine where, in 1869, a fire took the lives of at least 35 men. That evening, Roberts says he was physically attacked by entities.</p><p>The experience left him “shocked, freaked, scared, bewildered. And years after the fact — glad it happened.”</p><p>“I love the adventure, the thrill of the interaction, the confirmation there are energies around us on another level,” says Roberts, who thinks he’s spent more than $25,000 on paranormal trips.</p><p>What happened when a skeptic went hunting for Civil War ghosts</p><p>For sociologist Margee Kerr, author of “Scream: Chilling Adventures in the Science of Fear,” it makes a lot of scientific sense why people are drawn to paranormal adventures.</p><p>While there are similarities to riding a roller coaster or walking through a haunted house attraction, she says there’s a unique combination of “fight or flight” response and playing hide-n-seek that differentiates ghost hunting.</p><p>“There are physiological changes related to ‘high arousal’ states that come with increasing activity in our sympathetic nervous system, which drives the ‘fight or flight’ response,” she says. “And there’s the context of the situation, i.e., a search-and-find scenario, which most of us have enjoyed since we were kids — we love the anticipation of the ‘hunt’ and the potential payoff that can come with discovery.”</p><p>Kerr adds that “the intersection of fun and scary is big,” from dressing up for Halloween to visiting haunted attractions, playing “spooky games,” and of course ghost stories — “which evolves into ghost hunting.”</p><p>Author David L. Sloan, owner of Haunted Key West, operates ghost tours at the Fort East Martello Museum, which is best known for housing “Robert the Doll,” an infamous doll in a sailor outfit that some believe moves on its own, stirs up mischief, or brings about misfortune to those who disrespect him. Robert is famous enough locally that the phrase “Robert did it” appears on merchandise around Key West, and allegedly dates back to the early 1900s when artist Robert Eugene Otto would attribute bad deeds to his childhood doll.</p><p>Sloan, who also holds tours at the Key West Firehouse Museum, reports return visitors almost every night on ghost-hunting tours. About 60 people have come every year in the five years he’s held the VIP tour, he says.</p><p>“They’re fanatics about the ghost stuff,” he says. “I think people want to know what happens after they die. We all have the curiosity about what’s next, and this gives them the chance to actually explore.”</p><p>Nicole Beauchamp, 36, of Bay City, Michigan, says her ghostly fascination began as a child with two parents who shared the same interest, and encouraged her explorations.</p><p>Since 2009, she’s joined a paranormal cruise to England, France and Spain, and takes about three of these themed trips each year with repeat visits to New Orleans, Belfast, Northern Ireland and Weston, West Virginia, the site of the old Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum.</p><p>This paranormal hot spot, a former psychiatric hospital in operation from 1864 to 1994, was the site of a particularly compelling encounter.</p><p>While part of a public ghost hunt, Beauchamp  and another investigator found themselves walking alone in the dark down a long hallway on the geriatric wards. She says she asked out loud if anyone was there with them, and “immediately, the sound of what seemed like hundreds of stretchers and medical carts rushed directly toward us.”</p><p>“It was deafening,” she adds. “And it felt as though it was barreling straight at us.”</p><p>Beauchamp says the sounds immediately ceased when she clicked on her flashlight, but her audio recorder captured the clattering of wheels.</p><p>Visiting former mental asylums: Hopeful, haunted or ‘nightmare factories?’</p><p>In Sloan’s opinion, this type of paranormal encounter allows the curious to explore what they may have only previously seen on TV.</p><p>“When you get to try to do it on your own and be left alone to face your fears — and being in these historic places where the mood is right — you can try to discover for yourself what’s out there.”</p><p>Beauchamp says experiences like what happened at the asylum are one aspect that has led to her spending $100,000 — “if not more” — on paranormal trips. She says they allow her to combine that passion with her own historical research, and she values the community she has found at paranormal events, where she’s felt “truly seen for the first time.”</p><p>“It is a significant financial commitment, but one I have always considered worthwhile because of the experiences, history and community it brings.”</p><p>The community sentiment comes up a lot within this subculture. Paranormal travel is about more than revisiting haunted sites or chasing fresh evidence for participants; it’s about finding their spooky nerd tribe, and having a third space where they can trade stories, discuss ideas and share the thrill of the unknown.</p><p>“The investigations get people in the door,” says Amy Bruni, owner of Strange Escapes paranormal tourism company and a TV personality and executive producer of “Kindred Spirits.”</p><p>“They really want to get into these places and look for ghosts. But once they get there, they realize there’s an actual community here, and these are people they can talk about weird things with all weekend,” says Bruni, host of the “Haunted Road” podcast who is also a bestselling author, most recently of the “Food To Die For” cookbook.</p><p>Still, the possibility of a terrifying experience lures visitors back for repeat hauntings — such as when Leonhardt thinks he may have met “The Principal” at the Farrar School in Iowa.</p><p>“When I heard and felt the door shake, I was literally sitting right next to it,” he says. “With the reputation of The Principal, my mind went blank. If it could shake the door, what could it do to me?”</p><p>That kind of chilling question, along with the surge in popularity of Halloween and the chance to celebrate the season year round, suggest the appeal of paranormal tourism might continue to grow.</p><p>And dedicated spooky travelers won’t be giving up the ghost hunt anytime soon.</p><p>Aaron Sagers is a travel and entertainment journalist/author with a special focus on folklore and the paranormal. He’s also a TV host seen on Travel Channel’s “Paranormal Caught On Camera” and host of the “Talking Strange” paranormal podcast.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

{"details":"<p>Danny Rensch is at the vanguard of chess.</p><p>He, alongside a few others, has helped to develop the sport from one which was played by the elites to a phenomenon that has exploded in recent years, particularly thanks to the rising popularity of online chess.</p><p>But to get to where he is now – a self-described “shepherd” for chess in his role as chief chess officer at Chess.com – Rensch has been on quite the life path.</p><p>As he describes in his new memoir, “Dark Squares: How Chess Saved My Life,” Rensch was raised in Arizona in what he describes as a cult, a group that he says orchestrated a separation from his own mother and exploited his proficiency at playing chess for its own reputational gain.</p><p>Rensch had to overcome many hurdles: Surviving emotional and substance abuse, developing tinnitus and allegedly being manipulated by a charismatic leader by being told he’d be the savior of chess. But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.</p><p>Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”</p><p>“I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.</p><p>“Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”</p><p>Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.</p><p>That was initially what life was like inside the now-disbanded Church of Immortal Consciousness.</p><p>According to the group’s beliefs, the Church of Immortal Consciousness followed the teachings of Dr. Pahlvon Duran, a figure who last lived in the 15th century. Rensch describes the group as a spiritual haven for those looking for direction. Known internally as the Collective, the group sought to give lost souls direction – or as they called it, a Purpose – in a supposedly egalitarian society.</p><p>Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.</p><p>Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.</p><p>Steven Kamp has previously denied the Church of Immortal Consciousness was a cult.</p><p>Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.</p><p>Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.</p><p>Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”</p><p>“There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.</p><p>Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.</p><p>Hassan has personal experience having been a former member of the Unification Church, the controversial religion founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954 and accused by critics of being a cult.</p><p>“So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.</p><p>“And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”</p><p>As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.</p><p>Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.</p><p>Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.</p><p>Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”</p><p>He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.</p><p>And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.</p><p>Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.</p><p>CNN Sports has attempted to contact Kamp to offer him the chance to comment.</p><p>According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.</p><p>This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.</p><p>“When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.</p><p>“It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”</p><p>This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.</p><p>But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.</p><p>The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.</p><p>Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.</p><p>Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.</p><p>“This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”</p><p>Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.</p><p>“The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.</p><p>As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.</p><p>While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.</p><p>He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.</p><p>That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.</p><p>“Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”</p><p>By that point, in 2009, Rensch had begun coaching on Chess.com. It was a humble beginning, but it allowed him to get his foot in the door at an organization which would soon enjoy a meteoric rise.</p><p>It wasn’t easy at the beginning. The website was set up in 2007 and, at that time, the main online chess platform was the Internet Chess Club (ICC).</p><p>Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.</p><p>‘Harder than losing in basketball:’ NBA legend Derrick Rose on his chess obsession and how it could save lives</p><p>As well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”</p><p>“We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.</p><p>Nowadays, Chess.com is home to over 230 million members, sees more than one billion moves being played every day, and is valued at over $1 billion with no venture backing, according to the company. During those early years as a start-up, the only financial backing the site was ever able to receive was a $70,000 temporary loan from the mom of Allebest’s friend.</p><p>As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a cheating scandal involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was eventually cleared of cheating in that particular match.</p><p>Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”</p><p>But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.</p><p>“We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.</p><p>“The truth is we always had a bit of an existential – viewing ourselves from 30,000 feet – view that this was kind of bigger than us and that we owed chess the opportunity to reach more people.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

That would be a symbolic gesture echoing the tactics of U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020, whom Wilders has long admired.</p><p>Wilders' losses, which will be closely examined by the likes of France’s Marine Le Pen and Britain’s Nigel Farage, stemmed from a poor performance by his party in its first attempt at government, growing competition on the right, and the success of centrist parties in uniting against him.</p><p>Wilders made his name as one of Europe’s original anti-establishment politicians, warning for two decades of the dangers he said were posed by Islam and immigration.</p><p>His shock 2023 election victory made the Freedom Party the Netherlands’ largest for the first time but, once in government, Wilders could no longer claim outsider status - and his ministers' inexperience quickly became apparent.</p><p>The Freedom-led cabinet struggled even on its core issue, immigration, despite having a Freedom Party minister in charge. Broader concerns, including a worsening housing crisis, went unresolved in what voters saw as a chaotic year.</p><p>\"I think it will be a warning to his populist colleagues everywhere in Europe, whether they are in Germany or Le Pen in France,\" said Dr. René Cuperus of the Clingendael Institute. \"You cannot screw up in government, that is the biggest lesson.\"</p><p>Professor Sarah de Lange of Leiden University agreed that Wilders’ party had been punished for its lack of experience.</p><p>\"We know from other cases like, say, Finland, Norway, even Austria, Italy, that parties (that) are more experienced ... can participate in very stable governments,” she said.</p><p>Wilders was also weakened by isolation. Mainstream parties ruled out joining a coalition with him, arguing that his move to collapse his own government showed he is unreliable. That pushed some Wilders voters toward conservative rivals.</p><p>That tactic doesn't always work, De Lange said. Once a party has been in government, voters assume it can be again. Wilders, who stayed in parliament to criticize his own coalition, maintained anti-establishment credibility through what she called a \"‘one foot in, one foot out’ strategy that has been very successful\" for Europe's populist movements.</p><p>Wilders’ dominance on immigration has been blunted as rivals across the spectrum adopt tougher positions. His calls to deploy the army to patrol borders and deny all asylum claims energized his base but would breach Dutch and EU law. Centrist and leftist rivals instead promised faster deportations and closer cooperation with Brussels.</p><p>New right-wing competitors have also emerged, including JA21, which won nine seats and could enter government in one leading scenario for how the next coalition will be formed.</p><p>De Lange said this fragmentation mirrors developments in Italy and France, where multiple far-right parties divide the vote but expand the overall pool of nationalist voters.</p><p>\"If you look at Italy, Fratelli d’Italia and Lega, which are both radical right parties for whom immigration really is a core issue, the combined seat share is 40%,\" she said. She estimated that in the Netherlands, the number of voters willing to back anti-immigration parties has increased from 20% to 30%.</p><p>\"I’m very cautious with saying there’s a limit to how many voters you can attract with a migration program,\" she said.</p><p>Wilders’ hyper-centralized party structure also limited his growth. The Freedom Party has no members other than Wilders himself, who hand-picks candidates and enforces strict message discipline.</p><p>As rival Dilan Yeşilgöz quipped in a debate, the Freedom Party “is just one guy with a Twitter account, there is nothing else.”</p><p>That control has helped Wilders so far, but it hurts his chances with voters who see it as undemocratic. A poll by IPSOS before the election found 49% of Freedom voters now think the party should open itself up.</p><p>For now, Wilders shows no sign of loosening control.</p>","headline":"Wilders' election losses do not herald decline of European far-right","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wilders-election-losses-do-not-herald-decline-european-far-right-2025-10-30/","message":""}
{"details":"<p>A legendary fossil housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh features skeletons apparently locked in prehistoric combat — an epic meeting of two of the world’s favorite dinosaurs: Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex. Or so paleontologists thought.</p><p>Researchers who spent the past five years studying the stunning collection of bones called the “dueling dinosaurs” say they have uncovered a case of mistaken identity, determining that the small-bodied dinosaur was not a juvenile T. Rex but rather a fully grown example of a hotly debated species known as Nanotyrannus lancensis.</p><p>“We have the growth record preserved in the microstructure of the bone, which shows that it’s an adult,” said James Napoli, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University and coauthor of the new study published Thursday in the journal Nature. The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.</p><p>While similar in appearance, the two dinosaur species would have been very different: Nanotyrannus was 18 feet long, agile and built for speed, with long legs and strong arms to grasp prey, while 42-foot-long T. rex had stocky legs and used its devastating bite to devour huge, slow-moving dinos.</p><p>Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.</p><p>The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.</p><p>“A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex.Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.</p><p>The dueling dinosaurs fossil was first discovered 2006, exposed as sedimentary rock eroded from the Hell Creek Formation, which dates back 65.5 million years and stretches across parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.</p><p>Nanotyrannus lancensis, which like T. rex is part of the larger tyrannosaurid family in taxonomic classification, was first identified from a fossil unearthed in the 1940s from the same rock formation as the dueling dinosaurs.</p><p>However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.</p><p>The new research, which examined and compared over 200 Tyrannosaur fossils, suggests that juvenile T. rex fossils were not as common in the fossil record as paleontologists previously thought. For years, the study authors reported, paleontologists have misidentified Nanotyrannus fossils as juvenile T. rex specimens and used the morphological features of the remains to model T. rex growth and behavior.</p><p>“What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.</p><p>The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a second species of Nanotyrannus, which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.</p><p>The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.</p><p>Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for tens of millions of dollars at auction, were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.</p><p>“This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.</p><p>He added that the implications of the findings go beyond settling a scientific disagreement.</p><p>“There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”</p><p>Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”</p><p>“For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.</p><p>“Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.</p><p>Rare look at the last days of the dinosaurs shows they were thriving, scientists say</p><p>However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.</p><p>“Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”</p><p>The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.</p><p>Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.</p><p>Napoli said dueling dinosaurs, which is still partially encased in rock, has many more secrets to spill. Scientists still don’t know how the two animals died — or why they were found entangled. But the Nanotyrannus specimen is 100% complete, which is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, Napoli noted.</p><p>66 million-year-old dinosaur ‘mummy’ skin was actually a perfect clay mask</p><p>“There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.</p><p>The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.</p><p>“There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

REUTERS/Octavio Jones Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>PORT-AU-PRINCE/KINGSTON/HAVANA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Hurricane Melissa's confirmed death toll climbed to 49 on Thursday, according to official reports, after wreaking destruction across much of the northern Caribbean and picking up speed as it headed past Bermuda in the North Atlantic.</p><p>Authorities in Haiti, which was not directly hit but nevertheless suffered days of torrential rains from the slow-moving storm, reported at least 30 deaths and 20 more missing.</p><p>At least 23 people, including 10 children, died in Haiti's southern town of Petit-Goave when a river burst its banks. Roads, houses and farmlands were also damaged by the rains.</p><p>Jamaica's information minister confirmed at least 19 deaths, but said authorities were continuing search and rescue efforts. The storm left hundreds of thousands without power, ripped roofs of buildings and scattered fields with rubble.</p><p>Jamaica's military has called on reserve personnel to report for duty to help with relief and rescue operations.</p><p>Melissa made landfall in southwestern Jamaica on Tuesday as a powerful Category 5 hurricane, the Caribbean nation's strongest-ever storm to directly hit its shores, and the first major hurricane to do so since 1988.</p><p>Windspeeds were well above the minimum level for the strongest hurricane classification. Forecasters at AccuWeather said it tied in second place for strongest-ever Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of windspeed when in struck land.</p><p>The forecaster estimated $48 billion to $52 billion in damage and economic loss across the western Caribbean.</p><p>Melissa also hit eastern Cuba, where some 735,000 evacuated, but as of Thursday, no deaths were reported there, despite extensive damage to homes and crops.</p><p>At 11:00 p.m. (0300 GMT), Melissa was a Category 2 storm 264 km (164 miles) west of the North Atlantic British island territory of Bermuda, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, packing maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (161 kph).</p><p>Residents in Bermuda had remained calm as the storm was expected to give the island a relatively wide berth. Authorities said they would close its causeway Thursday night and shut schools and ferries on Friday \"out of an abundance of caution.\"</p><p>In the Bahamas, which Melissa cut through Wednesday night, authorities lifted storm warnings but did not give the \"all clear\". An official said authorities expected to decide by Saturday whether it was safe for the hundreds of people who evacuated off affected islands to return to their homes.</p><p>The front page of Thursday's Jamaica Observer newspaper read: \"DEVASTATION.\"</p><p>Densely populated Kingston was spared the worst damage. Its main airport was set to reopen on Thursday, as was the capital's port. Relief flights and aid had begun to flow into Jamaica's airports, authorities said.</p><p>But across the country, more than 130 roads remained blocked by trees, debris and electric lines, authorities said, forcing the military to clear roadways on foot into isolated areas, with ambulances following close behind.</p><p>Satellite imagery showed swaths of trees and homes devastated in the hardest-hit areas of Jamaica, sparse remaining greenery defoliated and most structures destroyed.</p><p>In a neighbourhood of the island's Montego Bay, 77-year-old Alfred Hines waded barefoot through thick mud and debris as he described his narrow escape from the rising floodwaters.</p><p>\"At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.</p><p>\"I just want to forget it and things come back to normal.\"</p><p>In western parts of the island, people crowded by supermarkets and gas stations to fill up on supplies.</p><p>\"Montego Bay hasn't got any petrol. Most of the petrol stations are down,\" British tourist Chevelle Fitzgerald told Reuters, adding it took her at least six hours to cross the 174 km (108 miles) to Jamaica's capital.</p><p>\"The highway was closed. You had some blockage on the road and trees falling down,\" she said.</p><p>Over 70% of electrical customers in Jamaica remained without power as of Thursday morning, said Energy Minister Daryl Vaz, with power lines felled across the island's roadways.</p><p>Many schools remained without power or water, officials in the capital Kingston said.</p><p>Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief.</p><p>Despite the U.N. setting up a fund for developing nations to quickly access reliable financing for more extreme weather events in 2023, donations have not met targets.</p><p>U.S. forecaster AccuWeather said Melissa was the third most-intense hurricane observed in the Caribbean, as well as its slowest-moving, compounding damages for affected areas.</p><p>U.S. search and rescue teams were headed for Jamaica on Thursday to assist in recovery efforts, Jamaican authorities said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was prepared to offer \"immediate humanitarian aid\" to the people of Cuba, a long-time U.S. foe.</p><p>Authorities in Cuba - which Melissa struck in the night as a Category 3 storm - said they were \"awaiting clarification on how and in what way they are willing to assist.\"</p><p>At least 241 Cuban communities remained isolated and without communications on Wednesday following the storm's passage across Santiago province, according to preliminary media reports, affecting as many as 140,000 residents.</p><p>Residents of Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city, began returning to repair their homes.

{"details":"<p>An interstellar comet that originated outside our solar system just made its closest pass of the sun, setting it on an outgoing path — but it’s not leaving our cosmic neighborhood yet.</p><p>The comet, dubbed 3I/ATLAS, came within about 126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of our star, according to EarthSky. The object is currently behind the sun from the perspective of ground-based telescopes on Earth, but astronomers anticipate being able to view the comet again in a few weeks, said Darryl Seligman, assistant professor in the department of physics and astronomy at Michigan State University.</p><p>Stargazers using telescopes should be able to see the object in the predawn sky beginning November 11, according to EarthSky.</p><p>Astronomers will have a few more months to observe the comet before it begins heading out of our solar system, Seligman said.</p><p>The comet will make its closest approach of Earth on December 19, coming within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) — but it poses no threat to our planet, according to the European Space Agency.</p><p>Astronomers have been observing the comet, only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, since its discovery on July 1.</p><p>Each observation is shedding light on this interstellar object and how different it may be from comets that originated in our solar system.</p><p>Comets are like dirty snowballs left over from the formation of solar systems.</p><p>A comet’s nucleus is its solid core, made of ice, dust and rocks. When comets travel near stars such as the sun, heat causes them to release gas and dust, which creates their signature tails.</p><p>Astronomers are interested in capturing as many observations of the comet as they can because as it nears the sun, material releasing from the object could reveal more about its composition — and the star system where it originated.</p><p>Two bright comets will swing by Earth this month. Here’s how to see them</p><p>“When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” Seligman said. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles? It shows you the initial primordial material that it formed from.”</p><p>Scientists have used powerful tools, such as the Hubble Space and James Webb Space telescopes, along with a multitude of space-based missions, such as SPHEREx, to study the comet.</p><p>The SPHEREx and Webb observations detected carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulphide and water ice releasing from the comet as it neared the sun, according to the ESA.</p><p>Preliminary estimates indicate that the interstellar comet is 3 billion to 11 billion years old, according to a study coauthored by Seligman and Aster Taylor, a doctoral student and Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Fellow at the University of Michigan, in August. For reference, our solar system is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old.</p><p>Carbon dioxide turns directly from a solid into a gas in response to temperature changes much more easily than most elements — which means the comet has likely never been close to another star before its brush with the sun, Seligman said.</p><p>The interstellar comet faded from the view of ground-based telescopes in October, but it remained in sight for missions such as PUNCH, or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, and SOHO, or the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. The object also made its closest approach of Mars on October 3, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the red planet — and the spacecraft orbiting it.</p><p>Why 3I/ATLAS is trending today</p><p>While the government shutdown has prevented data sharing from any NASA missions that have observed the comet since October 1, the ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter attempted to capture views of 3I/ATLAS in October.</p><p>The cameras aboard those missions are designed to study the relatively close, bright surface of Mars, but ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter managed to observe the comet as a fuzzy white dot.</p><p>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the orbiter’s camera, said in a statement, noting the comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times “fainter than our usual target.”</p><p>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, will also attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November using multiple instruments despite the comet being farther from the spacecraft than it was when observed by the Mars orbiters. But astronomers don’t expect to receive the observations until February due to the rate at which the spacecraft is sending data back to Earth.</p><p>“We’ve got several more months to observe it,” Seligman said. “And there’s going to be amazing science that comes out.”</p><p>Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

{"details":"<p>Israel received the remains two deceased hostages held in Gaza on Thursday afternoon. The remains were transferred to Israel via the Red Cross and taken to the country’s national forensics laboratory for identification.</p><p>The deceased hostages were identified as Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>Cooper, 84, was one of the founder of Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza. He was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. His family was notified in June 2024 that he was killed in captivity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said he was was killed in captivity around February of last year.</p><p>Cooper was the last remaining hostage from Nir Oz, one of the communities hardest hit during the initial attack two years ago, whose body had not been returned. “We will always remember Amiram as a man of people and of words, a pioneer with values, a person of initiative and ideas who so deeply loved the kibbutz and its members,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Baruch, 25, was also taken hostage during the October 7 attack from his mother’s home in Kibbutz Be’eri. Baruch’s brother and grandmother were killed in the attack. Two months later, Baruch was killed in Gaza during a failed rescue attempt. “In this difficult and painful moment, we hope the family can find a measure of comfort in the closing of a horrific circle of 755 days and nights,” the kibbutz said in a statement.</p><p>Thursday’s transfer leaves the bodies of 11 deceased hostages remaining in Gaza.</p><p>“The effort to bring back our hostages continues uninterrupted and will not cease until the return of the last hostage,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.</p><p>The transfer of the remains comes just two days after Israel carried out punishing strikes in Gaza in response to the Hamas killing of an Israeli soldier in Rafah on Tuesday afternoon. The Israeli strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians, including at least 46 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, marking by far the deadliest day in Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect nearly three weeks ago.</p><p>Even so, Hamas and Israel said they were still committed to the US-brokered ceasefire agreement. The transfer of two more sets of remains from Hamas to Israel on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that the deal had not collapsed, despite the severe test it faced just days earlier.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that “nothing’s going to jeopardize” the Gaza ceasefire. He threatened to “take out Hamas very easily.”</p><p>The latest transfer appeared to proceed without the issues that have plagued recent attempts to return the remaining deceased hostages to Gaza. Hamas announced on Tuesday it was set to hand over one set of remains before saying under Israeli bombardment hours later that it would not transfer the remains.</p><p>On Monday evening, Hamas handed over remains of deceased hostage Ofir Tzarfati, whose body had been recovered by Israel in Gaza two years earlier. Tzarfati was not among the remaining deceased hostages to be returned under the ceasefire, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accuse Hamas of a “clear violation” of the deal.</p><p>The IDF then released video it said showed Hamas staging the discovery of the remains in Gaza City and turning over the remains to the Red Cross. In a statement, the Red Cross said, “It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.”</p><p>This story has been updated with additional development.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p></p><p>Lean in. Pop on your favorite headphones. I have a story for you. It’s the first great story I’ve heard, and it still haunts me after 26 years as a reporter.</p><p>The story stays alive through sound. So it’s important you hear the voices. We’ve put together a full audio telling of the Ghost of Mrs. Kyle, complete with a crackly recording of an unconventional woman, who was drawn to ghosts and added to the story. We also recorded audio on the grounds of the girls’ boarding school where this tale takes place as I try to make my way up a creaky staircase.</p><p>Enjoy! And afterward, be sure to catch our favorite audience-submitted ghost story, involving a headless motorcycle rider.</p><p>Play — if you dare! — to hear the story of Mrs. Kyle and Miss Charlotte. Scroll to follow along.</p><p></p><p>The tale starts in a unique place: A private boarding school for girls in Loudoun County, Virginia. Five hundred acres of rolling Piedmont hills. I lived on campus. My father was the head cook. My mom was the baker and later ran the guest house.</p><p>This is horse country.</p><p>When the stars aren’t out, it’s dark. When the students are in their dorms, it’s dead quiet. The sound of your feet in the gravel echoes. It sounds like someone is following you.</p><p>Steps from the dining hall, there’s an orchard. And on the edge of the orchard, there’s a tree. And under that tree, Mrs. Kyle was buried … twice.</p><p>Now, this story is more legend than fact, said to be handed down for nearly 300 years.</p><p>Our sole source is the school’s founder, Charlotte Haxall Noland, who told the story until the day she died.</p><p>In colonial Virginia, a Mrs. Kyle lived in a brick home near an orchard with her husband. And like many good tales in this area of the country, there is a tie to a Founding Father — one of the original American influencers to lend extra weight to this kind of story.</p><p>So in this one, Mrs. Kyle is connected to Mary Ball Washington, the mother of none other than George Washington. According to Miss Charlotte, Mrs. Kyle’s maiden name was Ball, a prominent colonial Virginia surname.</p><p>In a legend such as this, who’s to say the truth of it all?</p><p>Anyway, Mrs. Kyle had a baby … and reportedly went “crazy.” (Now, we’d call it postpartum depression.) And the treatment? Chaining her inside her own attic.</p><p>How long she was chained there, how she reacted to her confinement, if she saw her newborn or even what happened to that baby — that’s never been a part of the story. Now, her prison, the attic, still exists. It’s atop a creaky wooden staircase on the third floor of what was their brick house.</p><p>She would never leave her home alive.</p><p>It was summer. Her husband was away on business. And somehow, the story goes, Mrs. Kyle got free from those chains, ran down the stairs, tripped, broke her neck and died. Due to the heat, she was immediately buried in the orchard, outside the veranda of the couples’ brick home.</p><p>Years passed.</p><p>The Revolutionary War swept through the land.</p><p>Almost a hundred years passed.</p><p>Regiments of the Civil War marched through.</p><p>The Battle of Middleburg — 14 days before Gettysburg.</p><p>Another century turned.</p><p>In the early 1900s, along comes a woman: Miss Charlotte Haxall Noland. A remarkable spirit in her own right, and, as you’ll hear in a second, our narrator of the legend. She was born nearby. Her family owned land in the same region.</p><p>She spent her childhood riding horses, was presented at a debutante ball in Richmond, studied physical education at Harvard, went abroad to study at Oxford and eventually came back to the United States, determined to start a school.</p><p>In September 1914, she opened a boarding school that she dubbed Foxcroft. She never married. Devoted herself wholly to the school, where to this day she’s affectionately known as Miss Charlotte. Every Halloween season, the Foxcroft students walk deep into the woods to gather around the grave of Miss Charlotte to hear the legend their school’s founder kept alive in a distinctly spirited fashion.</p><p>This is the voice of Miss Charlotte, recorded sometime before her death in 1969:</p><p>“So when I was a very little girl, my grandfather used to tell me about the ghost of Mrs. Kyle. How she walked all around this big place. I’ve always liked ghosts and tales about them.”</p><p>From her childhood, in the late 1800s, Miss Charlotte was fascinated by tales of ghost stories. Specifically the tale of Mrs. Kyle. She said it led her to start her school on that very land.</p><p>“... and she was part of the reason I wanted to get it. Because, as I tell you, I like ghosts.”</p><p>Miss Charlotte lived in the same old brick house that Mrs. Kyle lived in, was chained in and died in.</p><p>“And there’s no doubt about it, Mrs. Kyle was there.”</p><p>According to Miss Charlotte, Mrs. Kyle’s ghost visited her and school staff.</p><p>“She was kind and good. I could feel her right behind me, breathing on my neck as I walked up the steps. She’d go to a certain door there, and then she’d go on up in the garage and disappear.</p><p>Even Miss Raymond, the first big head of Foxcroft, who lived in the house at the top of the steps — I hadn’t told her about Mrs. Kyle at all — and she said to me, “What is this? Are these footsteps that stop at my door and then go on up the steps?”</p><p>There were a number of teachers who came to Foxcroft and people who worked there who knew there was something, some sort of spirit that moved around because I wasn’t the only one. I heard dozens of people talk to me about it. So you see, it wasn’t just my imagination.”</p><p>So … Miss Charlotte wondered if Mrs. Kyle had unfinished business to take care of in this world. Miss Charlotte decided to dig into it … literally.</p><p>“She was simply the spirit of a restless soul. Who couldn’t rest because they had something to tell us. What the something was, I had no idea.</p><p>But I made up my mind I was gonna find out.</p><p>So, I decided I would try to dig her up.</p><p>That was simply fascinating to the girls. So I told the ones who got the highest marks, they could come when I began to dig the graves. There was only about six girls. I got two good, stout men there, and we dug and dug and found nothing.</p><p>The next day, we let the whole countryside come. That was everybody in the school and all our friends. It really was a funny gathering. And we began in real earnestness, four men digging instead of two. And there, we hit Mrs. Kyle’s bones.</p><p>If you can imagine the excitement when they brought up the first ones: Nice little ladylike ribs. I was so glad to see them.</p><p>It didn’t take very long now. And excitement was something beyond any words. Alice Jones leaned so far over the grave, yelling and looking at it, that she fell in. I’ve always thought what a horrible thing it would have been to have to write and say, “Dear Mrs. Jones, I’m so sorry your child broke her neck falling into Mrs. Kyle’s grave.” For I had no right to dig up a grave anyway.</p><p>But she didn’t break anything. She stood down there and realized that the lump in front of her was Mrs. Kyle’s head, her skull. She it grabbed in her arms and two men who were down there, also in the coffin, in the grave, roped her under arms and they pulled her up.”</p><p>“I’ll never forget, if I live to be a million years old, her triumphant look as she came up out holding the skull of Mrs. Kyle. It was wonderful.</p><p>It was then, and right then, about 5:30 on a May afternoon, I found out the secret of why she wound [up] dead.</p><p>And I looked at the skull, holding it in my hands. She was shot right through the very top of her head, a big bullet hole.</p><p>And the day after that, I wrapped it all — the skull — up in a newspaper, and I took it to Washington to the Smithsonian Institute.</p><p>There's a ballistic department there. And I showed the skull to them. They took it and gave it the most minute examination. It's a wonderful place, that Smithsonian. There's nothing there they don't know, or if they don't know it, they can find it out.</p><p>And brought it back to me within about a half an hour. Saying it’s a pre-Revolutionary bullet hole. Now, didn’t that answer the whole question? It did for me.</p><p>You see, she did the most natural thing in the world. As she rushed down the steps, the man who was left to take care of her, just leaned over the banister and shot her right through the head.</p><p>It’s the only way it could have been done, absolutely right in the middle. And then being scared to death to tell the husband how he shot her and what he did, they arranged to have her break her neck, falling down the steps.”</p><p>I’ve come back to Foxcroft to give you a sense of the place.</p><p>I remember going to look for my best friends near those steps. We were always running in and out of that old brick house building, where our parents worked.</p><p>As kids we knew the story of Mrs. Kyle’s ghost and dared each other to climb the stairs and peek at chains that we were told remained in the attic floor. In fact, I lived there for nearly 16 years and only once screwed up the courage to climb that staircase.</p><p>I’m attempting it now … late at night.</p><p>But I have yet to walk through that attic door and look for the chains, myself.</p><p>I can see that door, that white door. And I’m not going up to the top of those stairs. There’s no reason for me to go up and bother that woman.</p><p>I leave those stairs and walk around the campus. Foxcroft is a special place, not just to me. For generations, parents have sent their daughters to be educated in the spirit of Miss Charlotte: Determined, athletic and independent.</p><p>The school is modeled after British boarding systems. Girls are sorted into houses. Here, it’s the foxes and the hounds. And they’ll be foxes and hounds for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Students learn dressage and showjumping alongside history and science. The two houses compete in sports like field hockey and basketball. Of course, I never attended this school. But I studied it.</p><p>The tradition I found most unique? Each Halloween, they learn about the ghost of Mrs. Kyle.</p><p>The ritual goes like this: The foxes and the hounds hold a skit competition and the upperclassmen walk the younger students deep into the woods, to a tiny cemetery. Many years, students hear the scratchy audio recording of Miss Charlotte. Other years, students pass the legend by word of mouth.</p><p>The recording takes on a different meaning when you’re in that context. I remember the first time I tagged along as a teenager, went down to the cemetery in the woods, holding a candle and hearing that tape.</p><p>Candle wax dripped on Miss Charlotte’s gravestone.</p><p>So, we need to finish this story…</p><p>After she’d dug up Mrs. Kyle’s bones, Miss Charlotte supposedly had the remains examined by the Smithsonian Institution — I found no record of this examination.</p><p>But, at the center of campus, there is a permanent marker that keeps the legend alive.</p><p>Steps from the brick house, there’s an orchard. And on the edge of the orchard, there’s a tree.</p><p>And under that tree, Mrs. Kyle was buried again.</p><p>“We collected her rib bones and the ones that we dug up, put them all in a huge great Mason jar. It’s a jar that used to be old time pickle jars.”</p><p>Miss Charlotte had put the bones inside of a pickle jar and reinterred them.</p><p>“... and that’s where she’s to stay for always.”</p><p>A bronze plaque marks the spot. It reads: Here lie the bones of Mrs. Kyle who lived in the old brick house and died circa 1730. Her ghost still haunts Foxcroft.</p><p>“Well, she’d gotten the story to us. She told what she wanted to, what we wanted to know and she wanted us to know. And now she rests right there under the tree at the back of the orchard house.”</p><p></p><p>Our second helping of ghosts comes to us from Washington Post reader Candace Grant of Longmont, Colorado.</p><p>Back in 1973, Grant came home from college. Her young brother convinced her to attempt to summon an Elmore, Ohio, legend: the headless motorcycle rider. Grant, a retired special education teacher, often rehashes memories of the trip with her brother as an adult. She says she leans into supernatural explanations of the story because, she admits, “it’s more fun than being skeptical.”</p><p>Try to suppress your goose bumps as you listen to Grant’s story with archival audio from WTOL11, Toledo.</p><p></p><p>My name is Candace Grant and I have a personal experience with the Headless Motorcycle Rider of Elmore, Ohio.</p><p>“Elmore, Ohio. Living population? About 1,300. As for the resident ghosts? Well, it all depends on who you talk to.”</p><p>According to this legend, the headless motorcycle rider was a soldier who had returned from World War I only to find the love of his life had married someone else. Heartbroken and furious, he sped off on his motorcycle and crashed. His head and the motorcycle’s headlight were never found.</p><p>Now, people said, his ghost would appear to anyone who called for him in just the right way.</p><p>“For years, the story has been in this farming area that if a certain signal is given, a light from the bike appears, and the ghost crosses the bridge once again.”</p><p>I was home for the summer from college. This was back in 1973. My family was living in Toledo and my brother kept talking about the headless motorcycle rider. He finally persuaded me to drive him and his friends out to see if we could summon that ghost.</p><p>I had four teenage boys crammed in my 1969 Volkswagen bug. One of their older brothers led us to the spot and instructed me to stop, flash my headlights three times, and wait.</p><p>Nothing happened. I tried again.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>I decided to turn around and drive back past the old farmhouse. The boys begged me to go back. So I did. This time a corn shock, a vertical pile, almost like in a tepee shape of corn, stood right in the middle of the road. Something that definitely hadn’t been there minutes earlier. I thought it was very, very strange. Like, what the heck is going on here?</p><p>So I drove around it, and we went back to the spot where we’d been waiting. I stopped the car and we started the signaling again. And again, nothing happened. I turned the car around, but this time the corn shock was scattered across the road. And the way it was scattered, it looked as though a car had driven through it.</p><p>We hadn’t seen another car at all that night.</p><p>I turned around, I flashed the headlights three times.</p><p>This time, in my side view mirror, I saw a single motorcycle headlight moving fast on a perpendicular road toward us. The light turned onto our road and sped closer and closer.</p><p>The boy screamed as I pushed the little car to its limit. It chased us.</p><p>Then suddenly, it faded away into darkness.</p><p>After that, our adrenaline was just going wild. And I turned around, we went past the farmhouse again. The corn stalk was still scattered and we headed home.</p><p>For the longest time, I’ve been thinking we were set up. I thought because we were led out there, I just had this feeling, but then I’ve read about the other people’s experiences on it, so I really don’t know what to make of it all. But it’s just fun memory. It is such a fun memory to have.</p><p>And I think I’d rather now think it was something supernatural as compared to a setup because it just makes the story a lot more fun rather than being skeptical.</p><p>— Candace Grant</p><p>About this story</p><p>Photos by Sarah L.

One of the guards slapped his hand away, his father said.</p><p>“It’s just very, very sad,” Zaher said, his voice cracking. “You don’t know after they take him in – you don’t know if they’re gonna hit him again.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The Kremlin’s constant nuclear boasts may have finally struck a chord in the White House, with President Donald Trump ordering the resumption of US nuclear weapons tests.</p><p>“Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Trump wrote in a post on social media Thursday.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to a nuclear weapons test, or a test of a nuclear-capable weapons system. His announcement came shortly before a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, but he indicated China had not prompted his decision, telling a reporter later Thursday that “it had to do with others.”</p><p>Trump’s order came just hours after Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin, visiting a military hospital in Moscow, dropped his latest nuclear bombshell. Sitting alongside the chief doctor and a carefully selected cast of Russian servicemen wounded on the front lines of the brutal war in Ukraine, Putin claimed that another “invincible” Russian weapon had been successfully tested.</p><p>This time it was the Poseidon – an experimental nuclear-powered underwater torpedo which military analysts suggest may have a range of more than 6,000 miles (9,650 km) and which Putin revealed has now been test-launched for the first time.</p><p>“The Poseidon’s power significantly exceeds that of our most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile,” the Russian president told his already war-scarred audience. “It is unique in the world,” he added, while intercepting the weapon would be “impossible.”</p><p>Putin mentioned, almost as an aside, that the long-anticipated and massive Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, popularly referred to as the “Satan 2,” will also soon be deployed – a low-key announcement of the arrival of what has been widely dubbed the world’s deadliest nuclear weapons delivery system.</p><p>It’s the second time in a week that Putin has boasted of new weapons of mass destruction poised to join Russia’s already formidable nuclear arsenal. The US and Russia agreed to limit their arsenals of nuclear arms under the New START treaty, which came into force in 2011. Under the agreement, both countries had seven years to meet defined limits on the number of deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons they can have. The treaty, however, is due to expire in February 2026.</p><p>Just days before the Poseidon announcement, the Kremlin strongman announced that Russia had successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik – or Storm Petrel – claimed by its military to be capable of flying at subsonic speeds, using nuclear fuel, for virtually unlimited time and distance.</p><p>Of course, there are serious technical doubts about the practicality of weapons that depend on notoriously unreliable, not to mention toxic, nuclear power. Their deployment, if it happens at all, is likely to be a long, long way off.</p><p>For its part, the Kremlin sees its nuclear saber-rattling less as a direct military threat and more of a diplomatic tool: a cost-effective and immediate way of getting the US and the West at large to take notice; to give Moscow what it wants in Ukraine, and to focus minds on the potential existential threat that a provoked or denied Russia could pose.</p><p>The Kremlin already feels both of those things over Ukraine: provoked most recently by the debate over whether or not to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, which would put targets in and around Russia’s biggest cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg under threat; and denied by the failure of Washington to force Ukraine and its European backers to accept Moscow’s maximalist terms to end the fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>Putin claims successful test of long-range nuclear-powered cruise missile amid diplomatic breakdown</p><p>Certainly, the timing of the latest threats, as diplomatic progress with the United States has stalled, has been less than subtle.</p><p>But for the Kremlin, the response from the White House has been unexpected.</p><p>As Trump – frustrated by the Kremlin’s consistent refusal to immediately end its war in Ukraine – hinted at canceling a planned Budapest summit with Putin, before imposing sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil companies, the Russian president made sure he was pictured overseeing what he insisted were “planned” nuclear triad drills in which long-range missiles were test-launched from land, sea and air.</p><p>It was a classic bit of Kremlin nuclear saber-rattling theater, but seemed to elicit little US response.</p><p>Days later, the Burevestnik cruise missile tests were announced by Putin dressed, somewhat unusually, in a military uniform. But even that was waved off by a dismissive White House.</p><p>“And I don’t think it’s an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday, on his way to Asia for a three-stop tour that included a landmark meeting with Chinese leader Xi.</p><p>“He ought to get the war ended, a war that should have taken one week is now in its fourth year, that’s what he ought to do instead of testing missiles,” Trump added.</p><p>But by ignoring that advice and then immediately announcing the testing of the nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo, potentially capable of wreaking radioactive destruction on entire coastal regions of the United States, the Kremlin may have inadvertently edged the White House into that decision to resume nuclear weapons tests of its own.</p><p>It may be a lesson in the hazards of mixing loose talk with nuclear weapons in an increasingly volatile world. And what may have been intended by the Kremlin as a way of bolstering its arguments over Ukraine, has possibly plunged us all into new, dangerous and unpredictable era.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on a kleptocratic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was removed this month as president of the Serb territory within Bosnia and Herzegovina for chipping away at the US-brokered peace deal that ended bloody ethnic violence in the Balkans in the 1990s.</p><p>The waiving of sanctions on Milorad Dodik followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.</p><p>Dodik had been sanctioned by the US for flouting the Dayton Peace Agreement, which was painstakingly thrashed out in Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War. While the agreement stopped the bloodshed, it carved Bosnia into two entities: the Federation, where Bosnian Muslims share power with Croats, and the Serb-majority Republika Srpska.</p><p>Over 20 years in and around power in Srpska, Dodik routinely threatened to split from Bosnia and “reunite” with Serbia. He has halted Bosnia’s integration into Europe by stoking ethnic tensions, often meets with Putin in Russia and has cultivated what the US Treasury Department previously called a “corrupt patronage network.”</p><p>Bosnians had recently begun to imagine a post-Dodik future, after the longtime leader was convicted by a federal Bosnian court of undermining the Dayton agreement, banned from holding political office and stripped of his post as president. But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.</p><p>“What sort of message does this send – that if you have the right connections and the right lobbyists, you can be removed from the sanctions list? It’s setting a negative precedent,” Andi Hoxhaj, a Balkan expert at King’s College London, told CNN. Coming three weeks before Dayton’s 30th anniversary, he said the timing of the Trump administration’s decision was especially dispiriting.</p><p>The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.</p><p>The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.</p><p>Dodik hailed Trump and his allies for waiving the sanctions against him, saying the decision corrected “a grave injustice” inflicted upon Srpska “by the Obama and Biden administrations.” What Dodik failed to mention, however, is that he was also sanctioned by the Trump administration in July 2017 for obstructing the Dayton agreement. The Biden administration imposed fresh sanctions on him in 2022 and again in early 2025.</p><p>Dodik began to court Trump before the 2024 election, when the president was facing dozens of criminal charges. “America needs you, but the rest of the world as well!” Dodik wrote to Trump in September that year, following the second assassination attempt against him.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.</p><p>In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”</p><p>Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich’s firm, signed a contract with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.</p><p>Marc Zell, another lobbyist, also signed a contract with the Srpska government in December 2024 worth $1 million for one year’s work, plus a bonus if Zell’s firm successfully brought about the removal of sanctions on Dodik and his allies, according to documents also filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act website. In an email, Zell told CNN that the bonus fee provision was canceled in accordance with US law.</p><p>This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president, said Dodik’s removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”</p><p>Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, called for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”</p><p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump’s one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump’s famous MAGA hats.</p><p>Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”</p><p>US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”</p><p>“Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A drone image shows wind turbines and solar panels, in Changhua, Taiwan, May 16, 2025. REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>LITTLETON, Colorado, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's utilities have cranked natural gas-fired electricity generation to new highs this year, bucking regional and global trends toward increased clean energy within power mixes.</p><p>Just over 87% of Taiwan's electricity supply was produced by fossil fuels in the first eight months of this year, data from energy think tank Ember showed, the highest fossil fuel share on record for Asia's eighth-largest economy.</p><p>That fossil fuel generation share also sharply exceeded Asia's average of around 62% and the global average of 57%, meaning Taiwan stands out among major economies in terms of energy transition momentum - albeit for the lack thereof.</p><p>A dearth of raw material deposits means Taiwan must import more than 90% of energy products, including nearly all of the oil, coal and natural gas it burns.</p><p>The mountainous and densely populated island is also ill-suited to large-scale renewable energy farms, though there is rapidly growing adoption of rooftop solar systems in several areas.</p><p>The share of utility-scale electricity generation from renewable energy was around 11% last year. That could climb to around 15% in 2025 due to offshore wind projects that entered operation this year.</p><p>Taiwan did generate as much as 25% of electricity from nuclear reactors in the early 2000s but closed its last nuclear power plant in May due to political pressure and widespread public concern about safety.</p><p>The shutting of the Maanshan nuclear plant, alongside the still-limited generation footprint from renewable sources, means utilities remain heavily dependent on fossil fuel for the majority of power generation.</p><p>While overall fossil fuel electricity generation scaled new highs this year, output from coal-fired power plants has steadily fallen since 2019 and so far this year has dropped to the lowest in at least a decade.</p><p>Public pressure to improve air quality has spurred the closure of outdated plants. So far this year, coal-fired generation has supplied less than 40% of electricity for the first time.</p><p>To offset reduced coal-fired output, as well as the shuttering of nuclear generation capacity, utilities have steadily increased natural gas-fired generation over the past five years or so.</p><p>During January to August, electricity output from gas-fired plants was 89.2 terawatt hours, Ember data showed.</p><p>That marked a 12% increase from the same period a year earlier and a 52% jump from 2019. Gas-fired plants have generated a record 47% share of electricity so far this year.</p><p>To fuel ever-increasing gas generation needs, Taiwan boosted imports of liquefied natural gas by 35% over 2019 through 2024, the largest percentage increase among the five biggest LNG importers over that period.</p><p>Over the first three quarters of this year, LNG imports have climbed to a record of 18 million metric tons, showed data from commodities intelligence firm Kpler.</p><p>That total marked a 7% rise from the same period a year prior, sharply outpacing China and Japan, which are the top two LNG importers but have registered contraction in import volume so far this year.</p><p>Taiwan's LNG imports during the three months through August set a record of 6.6 million tons, representing a bright spot in LNG import markets as nearly all other major importers reduced imports during that period.</p><p>As July and August typically mark high points for gas-fired power demand in Taiwan - due to higher use of energy-intensive cooling systems during the summer - LNG imports may slow in the coming weeks.</p><p>But given a high reliance on gas for power during the winter heating season, Taiwan looks set to remain a regular large LNG buyer for the foreseeable future.</p><p>That constant need for fossil fuel - both for imports and as the basis for its domestic power network - makes Taiwan stand out among peers as a holdout against the energy transition progress that is more evident elsewhere.</p><p>Continued build-out of wind farms should nudge renewable energy supplies steadily higher in due course. However, over the coming years at least, Taiwan will remain heavily fossil fuel-dependent and a stand-out customer for gas exporters.</p><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.</p><p>Enjoying this column?

{"details":"<p>The air is turning blue over the Capitol Dome. And the government is more shut than ever.</p><p>Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that behind-the-scenes efforts were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.</p><p>But the day ended with senators skipping town for the weekend — to join members of the House not seen inside the Beltway for so long it’s hard to remember what they look like.</p><p>What’s so galling is that both Republicans and Democrats insist they are keeping faith with their duties — taking care of the American people — but that the other side is willing to drive ordinary citizens to the brink of hunger or sickness.</p><p>Senate Democrats triggered the shutdown, refusing to extend federal funding until Republicans agree to extend expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies, without which millions of citizens will see the cost of health care rocket.</p><p>Republicans are willing to talk — but only when the government is opened again. Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.</p><p>The result: Vital SNAP benefits that help feed more than 40 million people are within hours of running out. Federal workers deemed essential have slogged through demoralizing weeks without pay. And it’s no vacation for their furloughed colleagues either: Financial obligations aren’t shut down just because the government is.</p><p>Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.</p><p>In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.</p><p>Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure on air traffic controllers, implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies. And President Donald Trump — perhaps the sole agent with the capacity to change the political wind and end the shutdown — didn’t really say anything until a late-night post calling on GOP senators to abolish the filibuster to end the funding stalemate.</p><p>West Virginia Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said staying in town over the weekend “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.</p><p>And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,” Fetterman told CNN. He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.</p><p>Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.</p><p>Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.</p><p>But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.</p><p>One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed. US District Judge Indira Talwani signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.</p><p>“Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.</p><p>“The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.</p><p>Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.</p><p>But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.</p><p>But at some point, this shutdown will end. It has to.</p><p>If the denouement does not come from a president who discovers a moral or political imperative to live up to his 2016 convention vow, “I alone can fix it,” it may emerge from a creative fudge in the Senate in which Republicans give a handful of Democratic senators political cover to vote to break the filibuster and reopen the government.</p><p>Majority Leader John Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to rage at Democrats in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.</p><p>But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.</p><p>One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.</p><p>Therefore, in the absence of progress, everyone had to fill the space.</p><p>“We are now beginning Day 30 of the Democrat shutdown,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana. “There are millions of Americans … that are bracing themselves for further pain and hardship.”</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the administration of enacting “policy violence” by refusing to extend Obamacare subsidies while offering a $20 billion bailout to Trump’s MAGA pal President Javier Milei in Argentina.</p><p>Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”</p><p>And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.</p><p>It’s not exactly promising.</p><p>But Thune told reporters, “I’m always optimistic. Aren’t you?”</p><p>That’s a tough one, senator.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>When Chinese leader Xi Jinping inserted a reference to “twists and turns” in his relationship with President Donald Trump in the opening remarks of their summit this week, he could hardly have imagined the twist that came minutes before the talks began.</p><p>Writing from Marine One, which was gliding toward the airport in South Korea where he was due to meet Xi, Trump instructed the Pentagon to resume nuclear testing after a 33-year pause, citing other nations’ — including China’s — own capabilities.</p><p>“That process will begin immediately,” the president wrote on social media.</p><p>The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin. Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.</p><p>Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.</p><p>The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.</p><p>Nuclear saber-rattling from Trump and Putin signals a dangerous new era</p><p>Administration officials offered little clarity when questioned about the message on Thursday.</p><p>“I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”</p><p>“To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”</p><p>Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.</p><p>A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”</p><p>He seemed less cautious in his Truth Social message this week.</p><p>“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”</p><p>Afterwards, Trump was circumspect about what tests, precisely, he was asking for.</p><p>“With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.</p><p>He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.</p><p>Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.</p><p>Neither China nor Russia have conducted a nuclear test in decades. While China has worked rapidly to expand its arsenal, it is not known to have conducted an explosive test since 1996.</p><p>Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.</p><p>“Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.</p><p>Still, if Trump was ordering up the first test of a US nuclear explosive since 1992, it came as news to the military officer he nominated to oversee the nation’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons.</p><p>“I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.</p><p>“I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”</p><p>If confirmed to the position, Correll would be responsible for the more than 41,000 service members who look after components of the US nuclear weapons program, including submarines, ballistic missiles and Air Force bomber aircraft. He has served as the deputy commander of US Strategic Command since 2022 — so it’d be unusual if he didn’t know know about a change in the decadeslong moratorium on nuclear testing.</p><p>The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.</p><p>There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.</p><p>“The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.</p><p>Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.</p><p>In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.</p><p>In a particularly heated moment from his first term, Trump taunted North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — whose 2017 underground test is the last known example of explosive nuclear testing — for the relative size of his “nuclear button.”</p><p>“I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump wrote on social media in 2018.</p><p>He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.</p><p>Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.</p><p>“If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.</p><p>“The United States has a test site just outside Nevada where we conducted these tests in the 1990s and before,” he added.</p><p>“But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump on Thursday urged congressional Republicans to unilaterally end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster — urging them to take an unprecedented step that GOP leaders have firmly opposed until now.</p><p>“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.</p><p>The directive — which came after Trump returned from several days abroad — is likely to upend efforts on Capitol Hill to bring an end to the weekslong funding impasse. And it immediately ratcheted up the pressure on Republican leaders, who have adamantly opposed eliminating the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation as a way to end the shutdown.</p><p>Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.</p><p>The filibuster rule is unique to the Senate, and it gives the minority the power to block a bill from coming up for a vote as long as at least 41 senators oppose it. Since one party rarely wins more than 60 seats, proponents have argued that the filibuster encourages compromise and makes it more difficult to enact massive partisan reforms.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”</p><p>At the time, Thune said he’d gotten no pressure from the White House to end the filibuster.</p><p>But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.</p><p>Anxiety, fear and paralysis: Being a military family in the era of government shutdowns</p><p>“Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”</p><p>Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.</p><p>The Senate is not slated to return to Washington until Monday evening, putting lawmakers just days away from breaking the 35-day mark for the longest-ever government shutdown.</p><p>Critical food aid for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend.

{"details":"<p>The exterior of the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building is seen in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 14, 2022. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>ORLANDO, Florida, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell surprised many market-watchers on Wednesday when he declared that another interest rate cut in December was not a slam dunk. Perhaps even more surprising was his apparent suggestion that if boosting the labor market is the goal, rate cuts might not be that useful.</p><p>In the press conference after the central bank lowered its fed funds policy target range by 25 basis points, Powell cited several reasons why a similar move in December is \"far from\" a done deal. These included \"strongly different\" views among rate-setters, limited data visibility due to the government shutdown, above-target inflation, and doubts about how quickly the labor market is slowing. He also noted that policy may be close to neutral after 150 basis points of easing.</p><p>But perhaps the most telling reason was the most simple: cutting rates won't work. At least, doing so won't address the current problem, which is supporting the softening labor market.</p><p>Alluding to this, Powell admitted that the job market is weakening primarily because of shrinking labor supply rather than cooling demand for workers.</p><p>But lower borrowing costs are designed to boost demand for workers. If the job market's problems are \"mostly\" a function of labor supply, as Powell said, then cutting interest rates is akin to pushing on a string.</p><p>\"So the question then is what does our tool do, which supports demand? Some people argue that this is supply, and we really can't affect it much with our tools. But others argue, as I do, that ... we should use our tools to support the labor market when we see this happening,\" Powell told reporters.</p><p>\"It's a complicated situation.\"</p><p>The current U.S. economic picture is indeed complicated.</p><p>Job growth has slowed in the U.S. over the past year, but this has been offset by a steep decline in the number of people looking for work. That's a result of the tighter immigration controls, increased deportations, and both young people and retirees leaving the labor force.</p><p>In the last official monthly jobs report, which was for August, the unemployment rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.3%. But that's only one tenth of a percentage point up on the previous year, and is still ultra-low by historical standards.</p><p>Powell also said there's no evidence of a worrisome deterioration in the broader labor market, though the recent announcement of some high-profile corporate layoffs may suggest otherwise.</p><p>At the same time, economic indicators such as business investment and retail sales still appear fairly healthy. Both are strongly linked to the booming stock market - big companies' rising share price and profits fund their capex, and the asset-owning top 10% continue to drive around half of all U.S. consumer spending.</p><p>What we appear to see taking shape is a so-called 'K-shaped' economy: the rich are getting richer from the asset price boom, while the rest are struggling.</p><p>This curious balance is new for the Fed and a tricky one to navigate, especially with the government shutdown reducing visibility even further.</p><p>Just as the Fed's blunt interest rate tool doesn't fix supply-side issues in the jobs market, it may not do much to support lower-income households and individuals either, even though ensuring a stronger labor market is the \"best thing\" the Fed can do for the American people.</p><p>Cheaper money is also likely to benefit the richest cohorts by inflating asset prices even more, which may also push already lofty valuations to unsustainable levels.</p><p>Six weeks is a long way off, but a third successive rate cut in December is suddenly in the balance. If the subtext of Powell's press conference is anything to go by, that may be for the best.</p><p>(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)</p><p>Enjoying this column?

{"details":"<p>First it took hold at New York Fashion Week. Black feathers spilling out the front of a beige car coat at Brandon Maxwell. An Altuzarra knit two-piece that made its wearer look like they had been tarred and feathered, but beautifully rather than as some heinous ancient punishment. A strapless gown that appeared cloud-like through rows and rows of delicate white plumes at Prabal Gurung.</p><p>The London shows were in on the game too — the cascading, multi-colored plumage of a Roksanda evening gown, or feral, feather-stuffed Converse high tops at Oscar Ouyang. In Paris, designers moved with the synchronization of a swallow murmuration. Pierpaolo Piccoli’s proposition for Balenciaga rested on feather-work: There was the full, plume-covered maxi skirt paired with a casual T-shirt, since worn in the wild by Elle Fanning, as well as a number of boxy dresses finished with delicate feather trims.</p><p>For Chanel, Matthieu Blazy set its specialist atelier Maison Lemarié on the task of creating feather Camellias, headpieces, earrings and large skirts. At Victoria Beckham the dresses were smaller, but no less quilled. Even The Row, the cult favorite of every millennial minimalist, dipped its toe into the showy textile with mid-length skirts that were given a feathery facade. Stella McCartney, fashion’s stalwart eco-warrior, joined in too with the invention of the world’s first plant-based alternative to feathers.</p><p>There was Big Bird Energy all over the runways this season. But how did bird feathers become a symbol of luxury in the first place?</p><p>Plumage has been in fashion since ancient Egypt, when ostrich feathers were used to decorate fans and even appeared in hieroglyphics. In Babylonian and Assyrian artworks, too, feathers are often seen covering the bodies of deities or embellishing royal crowns.</p><p>Around the mid-1500s, feathers entered the wardrobes of real people, at least in the UK. “That’s when they start to be worn specifically for fashionable reasons,” said Dr. Elisabeth Gernerd — a fashion historian and professor at De Montfort University in England. The ever-practical Brits worked with what they had to hand; attaching goose, chicken and egrets feathers that had been sterilized in chalk and sulfur to hats and fans. But while the material was fairly common, working people often reserved it for more everyday tools like making brooms or bedding.</p><p>18th century trend-setter Marie Antoinette popularized the style of having large, stately plumes — usually ostrich, the most prominent feather globally traded — erupting from a tower of hair. So giant were these headpieces, newspapers at the time often wrote salaciously about whose feathers caught fire from a candlelight at which ball. But it wasn’t until the 19th century, as the British Empire expanded and global trade routes became more established, that the “feather craze” reached its peak, according to Gernerd.</p><p>Birds of paradise from islands such as New Guinea were hunted and skinned, then exported to Europe and the US, where they were sold to milliners at auctions in London, Paris and Amsterdam. Their exotic feathers became associated with a new level of luxury and access. “In the 19th century, the Empire was in fashion and feathers are a way to display that fashion,” said Gernerd. “You’re wearing something that has travelled thousands of miles to get to you. You’re a symbol of growing Imperialism and trade.”</p><p>Vogue publisher Condé Nast stops showing fur in all editorial and advertising</p><p>It wasn’t just the odd plume, either. Entire hummingbirds were taxidermied and mounted on circular, feathered fans in the 1870s; while larger preserved birds adorned velvet bonnets. By the 1900s, millions of birds had been killed for the feather trade, threatening the extinction of several species. Demand was so high, the millinery industry was even pricing out American ornithologists from buying specimens for scientific research. When the Titanic sank in 1912, one of the most valuable commodities onboard was a container of ostrich feathers being shipped to New York. “They were insured for around $2.3 million in today’s money,” Gernerd said. “They were worth essentially as much as diamonds.”</p><p>But the style wasn’t universally accepted, and some campaigned against the mass slaughtering of the endangered animals. Harriet Hemenway and Minna B. Hall, two Boston socialites, turned against the fashion of their peers — launching a series of tea parties to attempt to dissuade other high-society women from wearing feathers. They founded the Audubon Society, an environmental conservation group, in 1905 — managing to influence state laws, such as the 1910 Audubon Plumage Law which prohibited the sale or possession of feathers from protected birds in New York State. By 1918, they had their first major victory: the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal law that made it illegal to hunt, capture or sell any migratory bird. In 1921, the UK passed its own anti-plumage legislation which outlawed the importing of exotic birds for fashion. But frustratingly for activists, ostrich — one of the most prominently used feathers in the fashion industry today because of their unique individual filaments and diffused softness — were exempt from conservation laws, according to Gernerd, since their feathers can technically be harvested without killing or skinning the animal.</p><p>Today, many fashion designers such as Donatella Versace, John Galliano and the late Giorgio Armani, have openly rejected the use of fur after decades of animal welfare campaigns — while luxury brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada and Burberry have also committed to going fur-free. Earlier this year Conde Nast announced it will no longer feature new animal fur in editorial content or advertizing across its numerous publications. But could the success of the anti-fur movement be fueling a plume boom?</p><p>“Fashion designers are definitely using ostrich feathers as an alternative to fur, but it’s an ill informed decision to do so,” said Emma Håkansson, founder of ethical fashion activist group Collective Fashion Justice, in a phone interview. “Because we don’t want to kill animals specifically for fashion, we’re just replicating that same problem with a different species here.” Despite the fact ostrich feathers can be harvested without slaughtering, Collective Fashion Justice published research in 2023 that found all ostrich feather production systems ultimately kill the bird.</p><p>It was Håkansson and her team who worked with Copenhagen Fashion Week to ban all wildlife materials on its runways in 2024, and who convinced the British Fashion Council to prohibit the use of fur and exotic animal skins later that year. Currently they are lobbying organizers at New York, Paris and Milan to commit to similar bans, and Håkansson is “hopeful” that their dialogue will lead to action.</p><p>But change needs innovation, as well as restriction, to stick. One of the most feather-filled shows of the Spring-Summer 2026 season came from Stella McCartney. According to the fashion house, the plant-based “Fevvers” used to adorn dresses are the world’s “first ethical alternative” to bird feathers. Inventors Nicola Woollon and James West, who have protected the technology with a strict Non Disclosure Agreement, used Stella McCartney’s runway as a proof of concept. The idea, they told CNN, only took a few intense months of development.</p><p>“With so many brands trying to move beyond animal-derived materials, it felt like the right moment to reimagine something so loaded with history and emotion,” Woollen told CNN in an email. “The conversation around materials has mostly focused on leather and fur. Feathers slipped through the next, and we wanted to change that,” West added.</p><p>Their first foray into faux feathers took inspiration from ostrich — the final frontier animal campaigners couldn’t restrict over 100 years ago. “Ostrich feathers are the ones most associated with couture and cruelty in equal measure. We wanted to reclaim that form and give it new meaning,” she wrote.</p><p>Despite the feather-filled runways of the latest season, it’s developments like Fevvers that keep Håkansson going. “What I hope people come to realize is that having policies in place that make fashion more ethical and sustainable is not restrictive of creativity,” she said. “It actually helps to produce more of it, because you have to think outside the box a bit more.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>EDITOR’S NOTE:  This article was originally published by The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.</p><p>In a very rare and likely precedent-setting agreement, the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston has agreed to return two works from 1857 by the Black potter David Drake, who made his ambitious jars while enslaved, to his present-day descendants.</p><p>By the terms of the contract, one of those vessels will remain on loan to the museum for at least two years, according to the lawyer George Fatheree, who is representing Drake’s descendants. The other vessel — a masterpiece known as the “Poem Jar” — has been purchased back by the museum from the heirs for an undisclosed sum. Now the work comes with “a certificate of ethical ownership.”</p><p>“In achieving this resolution, the MFA recognizes that Drake was deprived of his creations involuntarily and without compensation,” a museum spokesperson said in a statement. “This marks the first time that the museum has resolved an ownership claim for works of art that were wrongfully taken under the conditions of slavery in the 19th-century US.”</p><p>Fatheree goes further, saying he believes their agreement “is groundbreaking in the art world.”</p><p>“The application of principles of ethical restitution to artwork created by enslaved Americans, this is the first time that has ever occurred to my knowledge,” he said in a video call.</p><p>This once enslaved 17th century artist was misunderstood for centuries. A new exhibition rewrites his story</p><p>Ethan Lasser, chair of the art of Americas at the MFA, said the museum has learned from its work restituting Nazi-looted art. “We’ve become very expert in Holocaust restitution. We’re dealing with (repatriation) issues in our African collections and Native American collections,” he said over the phone. “And we want to bring the same standard to the fullness of our collection.”</p><p>He considers Drake’s work an example of “stolen property,” too, “since the artist is always the first owner of his work and he never got to make the call about where it went or what he was paid for it.”</p><p>Born enslaved around 1800 in Edgefield, South Carolina, a region known for its rich clay, Drake (who was also known as Dave the Potter) was one of relatively few African American potters to sign his work. He also dared — despite punitive anti-literacy laws for enslaved people in the state — to etch short sayings or poems on the jars, making them powerful acts of resistance. Some inscriptions boast of the jar’s intended contents or enormous capacity; others remark more poignantly on his own life or working conditions.</p><p>The “Poem Jar,” which the MFA originally bought in 1997 from a dealer in South Carolina, features a couplet that hints at Drake’s financial exploitation. The inscription reads: “I made this Jar = for cash/Though its called Lucre trash.” Currently in a gallery for self-taught and outsider art at the museum, it will assume a more prominent spot at the entrance of the Art of Americas wing once renovated in June 2026. (The jar that Drake’s family now owns has a signature and date but no writing.)</p><p>Another jar made the same year, 1857, has a particularly wrenching inscription in light of Drake’s forced separation from a woman believed to be his wife and her two sons. That vessel, at the Greenville County Museum of Art in South Carolina, reads: “I wonder where is all my relation.”</p><p>One of Drake’s great-great-great-great grandsons, the children’s book author and producer Yaba Baker, said he feels the restitution process offers one answer to that question. “It’s been exciting, overwhelming and feels full circle,” he said in a video call. He praised the MFA for “showing integrity and leadership” in “allowing us to connect to Dave’s legacy,” noting that “to go from being slaves to having a family of engineers and doctors and people in executive positions is a testament to Dave’s legacy in a different way.”</p><p>These descendants began talking about getting involved in Drake’s legacy in 2022, upon the opening of “Hear Me Now: The Black Potters of Old Edgefield, South Carolina,” an exhibition jointly organized by the MFA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The family soon hired Fatheree, fresh from his win in the Bruce’s Beach land reparation case. Earlier this year they established the David Drake Legacy Trust, governed by five of the oldest heirs.</p><p>So far there are about 15 family members involved, according to Fatheree, but they have created a website so that other descendants of Drake can be identified and join the efforts — what Fatheree calls “a big tent approach.”</p><p>The initiative’s repercussions could be widespread. There are thought to be around 250  pots by Drake still in existence, and over the past five years the market for his work has exploded, driven mainly by American museums competing for pieces in the hopes of telling a more complex story about the history of slavery in the US. Several have paid six figures for his work, and in 2021 the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas paid a record-setting $1.56 million for a 25-gallon stoneware jar at auction.</p><p>28 artworks mysteriously disappeared three decades ago. They’ve finally returned home to South Africa</p><p>Other museums that own Drake’s work include the Met, the Philadelphia Art Museum, the De Young Museum in San Francisco, the Art Institute of Chicago, Harvard Art Museums, the St Louis Art Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, as well as smaller venues in the American South.</p><p>Fatheree confirmed he has begun to reach out to some of these other art institutions on behalf of the family. “Our approach has been one of collaboration and invitation. I am not a litigator; we did not go to the museum and file a lawsuit (or) threaten to sue them. But our hope and frankly our expectation is that other institutions” — and private collectors of Drake’s work, he added — “will follow the Boston museum’s lead here.”</p><p>“This is not just an opportunity for museums to be on the right side of history,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for museums to rewrite history and think not just about ownership and stewardship, but think about stewardship and justice.”</p><p>Read more stories from The Art Newspaper here.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>CNN’s Clarissa Ward confronts the man who held Austin Tice captive. Subscribe to watch the full exclusive report.</p><p>“The Americans drove through here,” the Syrian army guard said, pointing to a steep road behind him. “I don’t know where they headed, I’m not allowed up there.”</p><p>The barricaded road leads to a labyrinth of military facilities wedged into the rocky slopes of Mount Qasioun on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. It was as close as CNN could get to the locations searched by an FBI-led team that came here in September looking for traces of American journalist Austin Tice — more than a decade after he disappeared.</p><p>The American team was hard to miss, arriving in a convoy of armored vehicles. Their objective was two-fold: to search for the place where Tice was last believed to have been held and, if possible, to find his remains.</p><p>The US search focused on a facility called the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center. It lasted less than three days. On September 9, Israel launched its explosive attack on Qatar and the delegation abruptly left.</p><p>The tip that led to the US search came from several witnesses, including Bassam Al-Hassan, a powerful adviser to former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the man who held Tice after his capture in mid-August 2012.</p><p>For 13 years, the mystery of what happened to Austin Tice has plagued multiple US administrations. Then, after the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, witnesses began to emerge. After fleeing to Iran, Al-Hassan made his way to Beirut, Lebanon in April, where he was interrogated by FBI investigators, along with several associates, about Tice’s capture.</p><p>In September, CNN managed to track the apartment where Al-Hassan was living in Beirut. After knocking on his door, the team introduced themselves as CNN journalists. During a 20-minute conversation, the first time he’s been confronted by a journalist, Al-Hassan told CNN that Assad ordered the execution of Tice.</p><p>“Of course, Austin is dead. Austin is dead,” he said, his comments captured on video by hidden cameras worn by the team. He nodded yes when asked if Tice was killed in 2013, saying that he had passed the execution order down to a subordinate.</p><p>“I don’t want to protect Bashar al-Assad because he abandoned and left us,” Al-Hassan added. “I don’t want to protect Russia or Iran, because the US thinks Russia and Iran have something to do with the case. And I can assure you that this is not the case. This relates to President Bashar only,” he said.</p><p>Assad fled to Russia after the collapse of his regime and attempts by CNN to reach him were unsuccessful.</p><p>Al-Hassan claims he passed the execution order onto a subordinate in the notorious Iran-backed, pro-government militia the National Defense Forces (NDF). CNN has learned the man in question is now in Russia. Through an intermediary, he refused to respond to CNN’s questions.</p><p>Several sources that CNN spoke to claimed that there are holes in Al-Hassan’s story. CNN has confirmed that he failed a polygraph test given to him by the FBI.</p><p>The truth is tangled in a web of lies that remain the enduring legacy of a regime that killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of its own people. In order to piece together what happened to Tice, CNN spoke to dozens of former and current officials, investigators and eyewitnesses in seven different countries. Many only spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters or protect their precarious status in the countries they fled to.</p><p>While CNN cannot confirm that Tice is dead, for the first time we are hearing from people with direct knowledge of his capture, captivity and attempted escape. The accounts they provide strongly suggest that Tice was killed more than a decade ago, but there is no hard proof. Since the Assad regime fell last year, the new Syrian government has been keen to establish good relations with the US and has been working closely with American officials to help solve the Tice case. The FBI has ramped up its own investigation, collecting evidence on the ground.</p><p>“As well as a recovery operation this is also an active federal investigation and there is always the goal of trying to bring some justice to this situation,” said a person familiar with the FBI investigation.</p><p>Since Tice disappeared in 2012, his family has not wavered from the belief that he is still alive. His mother, Debra Tice, has waged a tireless public campaign on behalf of her son, lobbying the US government across multiple administrations to do whatever it can to return him alive. Earlier this year, not long after the Assad regime fell, Debra travelled to Damascus to look for him and sat down with Syria’s new President Ahmed Al-Sharaa. She has previously dismissed Al-Hassan as a “pathological liar.”</p><p>“Austin Tice is alive. We look forward to seeing him walk free,” the Tice family told CNN in a statement.</p><p>Tice, an ex-US Marine Corps officer, reported from Syria during the summer of 2012, when protests against Assad had turned into an armed struggle. He embedded with rebels on the frontlines and documented the regime’s brutal crackdowns on peaceful protests. His daring approach got him bylines in top US outlets including the Washington Post and McClatchy.</p><p>He filed his last report from Darayya, a Damascus suburb that still bears the marks of years   of fighting and bombardment. His family and editors said they lost contact with him in mid-August when he was supposed to travel to Lebanon for a break.</p><p>For 13 years, the Syrian government consistently denied holding Tice or having any knowledge of his whereabouts, despite pressure from the American government and his family. Weeks after Assad fled Syria to Russia, cracks started to emerge in that story. Early this year, a former officer with Syria’s external intelligence branch, General Safwan Bahloul, gave testimony to Al Jazeera, saying that he’d interrogated Tice in 2012 at the behest of Al-Hassan.</p><p>Bahloul agreed to talk to CNN only after securing permission from the new government in Damascus. A security official led the way to his house up a leafy hill in Latakia, the coastal province in Syria known for its loyalty to the Assads. Unlike other former officials who fled Syria, Bahloul took a settlement offered by the new government that essentially gives him amnesty.</p><p>During a wide-ranging interview last month, Bahloul discussed how he first became aware of Tice.</p><p>“I went to [Al-Hassan’s] office and he told me, ‘We have caught an American journalist. We want you to interrogate and see the possibility if he’s not a mere journalist or if he’s a spy,’” Bahloul said.</p><p>Bahloul, who has spent time in the US and the UK and speaks English fluently, told CNN he interrogated Tice three times. “I just went through the names and the contacts on his phone, asking him about each name,” Bahloul said. “He was cooperative about it. He told me that he’s an ex-Marine officer. He wasn’t shaky. He was brave enough to face his custody. Sometimes even we talked about music.”</p><p>Tice was held in a Republican Guard compound often referred to as Tahoune, under the command of Ghassan Nassour, a senior officer who reported to Al-Hassan. The line between the Republican Guard and the NDF was often blurred with officers serving in both, including Nassour.</p><p>CNN managed to reach Nassour on the phone in his new home in the UAE.</p><p>“This was not a formal prison, but a brief detention facility for offending soldiers,” he said.</p><p>When CNN visited the compound in September, it was mostly refurbished and used by soldiers of the new government. Faded Assad murals, discarded ammunition and bars on the windows of some rooms were the only traces left of the old guard.</p><p>According to Nassour, the soldier who was assigned to bring food to Tice was instructed not to speak to him. Tice’s nationality and identity, Nassour claims, were known only to a handful of people close to Al-Hassan, whose office was across the road from Tahoune.</p><p>“Ask any soldier in Tahoune and he would tell you they knew we had an important [prisoner], but no one knew who he was,” a low-ranking soldier who worked in Al-Hassan’s office at the time, told CNN over the phone from his village in Latakia. He said he only figured out it was Tice when details of his captivity were reported in 2025. Before that, he did not dare ask.</p><p>Nassour recalled the day they took Tice to Rakhla, a mountainous area near the Lebanese border, to film a video that was released in September 2012.</p><p>Under the direction of Al-Hassan, regime soldiers dressed up as jihadists and led a blindfolded Tice up a hill while chanting “God is Great,” Nassour said. The point, he added, was to give the impression that Tice was held by extremists and not the Assad regime.</p><p>“The video was posted online the next day, and it was as if Tice was held by Taliban in Afghanistan and he never entered Syria,” Nassour said. Tice was seen in the 46-second video reciting the Muslim proclamation of faith and pleading, “Oh, Jesus.”</p><p>US officials and independent analysts quickly determined the video was a ruse. US investigators followed the digital breadcrumbs to the Syrian regime. It was taken as evidence that Tice was in government hands and the first and only proof of life.</p><p>Back in Tahoune, sometime in late October, Tice asked Bahloul for soap and a towel, which Bahloul said Tice used to escape. Syrian investigators at the time, Bahloul explained, determined that Tice used the soap to slip through the high window and the towel to jump over the shattered glass cemented at the top of the compound’s external wall.</p><p>The low-ranking soldier in Al-Hassan’s team described the ensuing havoc. “We were on a state of alert. There was chaos because someone had escaped prison,” the soldier told CNN. “They distributed his picture to the checkpoints close to the compound.”</p><p>Tice made it to the upscale Mazzeh neighborhood, about a mile from Tahoune. For more than 24 hours he was on the run in an area dotted with embassies and the homes of some of the regime’s top generals.</p><p>“Every security apparatus in Damascus, thousands of operatives, they started the search, and he was caught by one of them, and he was redelivered to the National Defense Forces militia, which was headed at that time by Bassam Al-Hassan,” Bahloul said.</p><p>Once Tice was recaptured, Bahloul was brought in one more time to see him.</p><p>“I felt the connection between me and him was just lost. I was talking to him and he was not responding. He was, in a way we could say, depressed,” Bahloul recalled. “I never saw the guy again.”</p><p>This time, Tice was taken to Al-Hassan’s office across the road from Tahoune. From there, the trail went silent, according to multiple Syrian intelligence and NDF commanders.</p><p>“I stopped asking about the issue,” Nassour said. “In Syria if anyone hears that you’ve asked about what doesn’t concern you, you will be in trouble. I never asked again until the fall of the regime.”</p><p>Bahloul told CNN of Tice, “It’s one of the most mysterious cases I have ever experienced.”</p><p>The person who knows the key to the mystery is Al-Hassan.</p><p>Al-Hassan served as Assad’s adviser and created the notorious NDF militia, implicated in some of the worst crimes during Syria’s civil war. He was sanctioned by the UK and the EU in 2011 and by the US in 2014. The US sanctions note his multiple roles in the regime including “acting as the Syrian presidential representative to Syria’s Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), which is the government agency responsible for developing and producing non-conventional weapons and missiles.”</p><p>In 2023, French prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Al-Hassan, Assad and others for complicity in war crimes over the use of chemical weapons against civilians in August 2013. The two attacks referenced in the case killed more than 1,000 people in the Damascus suburbs of Douma and Eastern Ghouta.</p><p>“He was sort of like a right-hand man to Bashar al-Assad, someone Bashar could absolutely trust, someone who Bashar could farm out his dirtiest jobs, his most unpleasant of tasks to,” said Economist journalist Gareth Browne who has covered Al-Hassan extensively since the fall of the regime.</p><p>Al-Hassan has refused to talk to journalists and the only photographs of him online were incorrect or very old. In September, CNN obtained a recent photo of him, and a tip about where he was hiding out — an upscale apartment complex in a suburb of Beirut.</p><p>A team from CNN spent an evening observing the buildings. One balcony and one man in particular appeared to match the photo. The next morning, CNN knocked on his door and asked him about Tice. He invited them in as soon as he heard Tice’s name.</p><p>During the conversation, Al-Hassan appeared rattled that CNN had found him and repeatedly asked who told where he lived. He explained to CNN that he had recently told a team from the FBI that he had been holding Tice when Al-Assad gave him the order to execute him. According to multiple sources with knowledge of the interrogation, Al-Hassan also claimed that he tried to push back on Assad’s order but that the then-president was adamant.</p><p>Multiple Syrians who know Al-Hassan disputed the likelihood of him challenging Assad.</p><p>“You could say whatever you like about Bassam, but he is not the courageous guy… I couldn’t imagine him giving such, you know, ‘Sir, we shouldn’t.’ No, he doesn’t give such advice,” Bahloul said.</p><p>Other sources told CNN that they question his motives for talking to the FBI. After the regime fell, the US government offered a reward of $10 million for information on Tice. Al-Hassan told CNN that he was not seeking a monetary award for coming forward.</p><p>Sources also described Al-Hassan as cunning, Machiavellian, and not someone to be trusted. In many ways, Al-Hassan embodied the culture of the Assad era.</p><p>“You have to look at the nature of this regime. You know, these people are competing with each other. It’s riddled with rivalries. There are people lying and deceiving each other, even though they’re nominally on the same side,” said Browne, the Economist reporter.</p><p>Both Nassour and Bahloul told CNN that when Tice was first captured Assad was pleased and saw him as a valuable card to be used in later negotiations with the US.</p><p>“Assad knew about Tice and knew he could use him in negotiations. It would be extremely stupid to kill him… to let go of a winning card in your hand,” Nassour said.</p><p>Others CNN spoke to believed it was plausible that Assad would order Tice’s execution, particularly after his escape.</p><p>Over the past 13 years, multiple US administrations made several offers to the Assad government in exchange for Tice’s release. Syrian negotiators were steadfast in their denial, even when US officials merely asked for a proof of life.</p><p>“It wasn’t logical for me. But I started to feel that there is something wrong happening around the case or around Austin,” General Abbas Ibrahim, Lebanon’s former spy chief, said of the failed negotiations during President Donald Trump’s first term.</p><p>A mediator who has negotiated the release of numerous Western hostages across the region, Ibrahim worked on Tice’s case through all US administrations starting with President Barack Obama’s until his retirement in 2023.</p><p>“The Americans were very interested in this case, and they were ready to pay any price to get [Tice] back,” Ibrahim said. “The regime in Syria had a big opportunity to save themselves [with] Austin, but they didn’t play this card because maybe they don’t have this card anymore,” he said.</p><p>During CNN’s visit to Tahoune and Bassam Al-Hassan’s office across the road, it was clear that traces of what happened there 13 years ago were gone — not just lost in the looting and vandalism by crowds retaliating against years of oppression in December, but painted over by the horrors these compounds witnessed over the years.</p><p>In the months after the Assad dungeons were flung open last year, the hope to find Tice and tens of thousands of missing Syrians began fading. Those who hadn’t emerged were presumed dead. Many of their families refuse to officially accept this until the remains are found. They still hope that the truth, buried in secret graves and hidden in millions of old government documents, could provide closure one day.</p><p>For the Tice family, the search for Austin goes on.</p><p>It was only at the door on our way out that Al-Hassan’s voice cracked, saying he owed Tice’s mother an apology.</p><p>“Truly, it upsets me to remember it. I wish what happened hadn’t happened,” Al-Hassan said. He removed his glasses revealing blood-shot eyes. “It was a predicament that I was burdened with.”</p><p>Tice may simply be remembered as yet another victim of the endless lies and senseless cruelty of a ruthless regime.</p><p>-Additional reporting by journalist Zaher Jaber in Syria</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>“This is either gonna be wildly successful or a complete disaster,” Austin Tice wrote in May 2012, on the eve of a dangerous journey to bear witness to history. “Here goes nothing.”</p><p>Tice, a physically towering former Marine and fledgling journalist, threw himself with grit and resolve into war zones, friendships and the injustices he cared deeply about.</p><p>But he is yet to return from that journey. Tice disappeared in Syria two months after setting off to cover the country’s crippling civil war, sparking a 13-year mystery that has tortured his Texan family and plagued Washington’s relationship with Syria’s brutal former dictator, Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>For more than a decade, nobody has seen or heard from Tice. His family has never lost hope that he is alive, even as successive administrations – from President Obama to President Trump – failed to bring him home.</p><p>But in December, Assad’s repressive regime – which had always denied capturing or killing Tice – collapsed in an instant. And in the chaotic months since, clues about Tice’s fate have begun to seep through the walls of Syria’s once-impenetrable prisons and palaces.</p><p>Now, a CNN investigation has revealed a remarkable development. Bassam al Hassan, a four-star general close to Assad, told CNN’s chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward that Tice was killed in 2013, the year after his capture. The order came from Assad, he said. But Hassan failed an FBI polygraph test, CNN has confirmed, and it is unclear which parts of his story remain a lie.</p><p>“Austin is like a bridge between America and Syria,” Waseem Enawi, a Syrian activist who hosted Tice in his home in Yabrud for three weeks, told CNN. “Through what happened to Austin, people can understand what happened to hundreds of thousands of Syrians,” he added.</p><p>“It’s the only good thing I can think of to come out of all of this.”</p><p>Long before his journey to Syria, Tice knew he wanted to make an impact.</p><p>The oldest of seven siblings, Tice was home-schooled by his devoted Catholic parents, Debra and Mark Tice, in Houston. The family loved to travel; they would visit Mexico at least one a year, took several cross-country road trips, and spent three months in Europe while Austin was a teenager.</p><p>“It was really important for my parents that we knew that there was a whole world out there,” Abigail Tice, Austin’s youngest sister, told CNN.</p><p>Tice was fiercly protective, Abigail remembered. “Whenever I would have a high school crush, he would talk to them and (say): ‘That’s my little sister, you better treat her with respect.’”</p><p>When Abigail’s daughter was born, Austin became a “huge, loving teddy bear,” Abigail told CNN. “Every single moment that he could, he was playing with her.”</p><p>At 23, Tice joined the Marines. “I think he saw the Marines as the greatest challenge,” said Brian Bruggeman, Austin’s battalion commander during his deployment to Afghanistan in 2011. “Austin was attracted to the way the Marines lead.”</p><p>Tice stood out, Bruggeman told CNN. “He was gregarious and extremely curious.”</p><p>He worked to assimilate his Afghan interpreter into the battalion, Bruggeman recalled, telling the local translator: “You’re part of our unit now.” A year later, Tice was delighted when the interpreter was accepted to an American college, and the man stayed with Tice’s family in Texas after moving to the US.</p><p>In Afghanistan, Tice opened up to his peers. “He let me in,” Bruggeman said. “He loved to talk about his family,” his commander recalled. “I felt like I knew his mom well before I ever met or talked to (her).”</p><p>The road that led, 13 years later, to hearing: ‘Austin is dead’</p><p>Tice had “an epiphany” while in Afghanistan, Bruggeman added: He wanted to get into photojournalism. He celebrated his 30th birthday by buying a camera and began documenting his deployment, sharing his stream of consciousness on blogs and on Twitter.</p><p>But Tice’s time in Afghanistan changed him in darker ways, too. He saw several fellow Marines killed or injured: One lost his left leg when an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated, and another was fatally electrocuted when his radio antenna touched a power line. He developed a morbid sense of humor about his own vulnerability.</p><p>“Heading out soon on a horribly conceived mission,” he wrote in one tweet. “Hopefully (it) will be forgotten like most dumb missions are; otherwise, see you on CNN.”</p><p>“I’ve served on the front lines of both our wars,” he wrote at another point, referring also to his service in Iraq. “Aside from my men, I have yet to see anything worth dying for.”</p><p>Tice returned to the US to complete a law degree at Georgetown University as the Arab Spring toppled autocrats and upended decades of tight-fisted rule in the Middle East. “Time to work hard, be dull, and prepare for the next great adventure,” he wrote.</p><p>But becoming a lawyer wasn’t his calling, and being dull wasn’t his nature.</p><p>“It’s not the path I saw for him,” a family friend of the Tices told CNN. “He was too much a person of action to sit behind a desk.”</p><p>So, after his second year of law school, Tice set his eyes on a new mission. And he wanted his brother to join him.</p><p>“I slipped into an empty room at the little house we were renting and listened, astonished, as he told me he was planning a trip to Syria that summer of 2012,” Jacob Tice wrote in a 2020 opinion piece for CNN.</p><p>Jacob turned him down because he couldn’t imagine traveling to an active war zone. But he wrote: “I encouraged him to follow his heart and to bear witness to the escalating conflict in Syria. I believed in his vision, admired his grit and was behind him completely.”</p><p>Tice understood the risks. He had a long-running streak with a close colleague in the online game Words With Friends, and he made a deal: If I don’t play my turn for more than a week, let people know I’m in trouble.</p><p>The night before he left for Syria, Tice met his family friend in a DC bar. “There was no talking him out of this,” the friend told CNN. “He wanted to tell their story. Because he felt like nobody else was there.”</p><p>“I think about that evening all the time,” added Tice’s friend, who asked not to be identified. “If I could have, if I could have stopped him.”</p><p>“God damn it, I wish I’d said the right thing.”</p><p>At the time of Tice’s trip to Syria, the country was seized by a violent civil war. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of rebel fighters, was advancing towards the capital Damascus in the country’s southwest and towards Aleppo in the northwest. Both cities had become key fronts in the conflict after Assad’s forces began cracking down on peaceful protesters the previous year.</p><p>Tice stayed with Enawi near the country’s northern border for nearly three weeks, interviewing locals about the war. “Everyone (was) saying hello to him – he was a little bit famous,” Enawi told CNN.</p><p>Tice wasn’t a reporter yet, but he didn’t want to waste time. “He desperately wanted to be a journalist. He wanted to be a success,” Liz Sly, a Beirut bureau editor at the Washington Post who worked with Tice and published three of his stories, told CNN. He wanted to learn by doing – and he was good at it.</p><p>“Lots of people struggle to write a news story. They don’t get it,” Sly said. “He didn’t seem to struggle at all. He seemed a natural.”</p><p>But Tice was raw, and a growing cast of seasoned journalists worked to hone his restless energy. David Enders, who traveled with Tice through Syria for several weeks and worked with him on a series of stories for McClatchy, told CNN: “One of the first things I said to him was, ‘if you tweet our location in real time, you will never see me again.’”</p><p>Tice and Enders embedded with a rebel unit and raced towards Damascus, sleeping in safehouses with their boots on and carrying only what they could run with. They jumped on makeshift buses and on the back of motorbikes and sometimes walked, evading government shelling and helicopters as they went.</p><p>“I am embedded w #FSA. Newsworthy stuff going on daily,” Tice tweeted in late May. “If someone wanted to hire me that would be great. Student loans don’t pay themselves.”</p><p>On one occasion, a tank shell hit the front of a house the pair were taking cover behind, Enders said. “I don’t have any recollection of (the) sound,” he said. “I remember the impact, and hitting the ground.”</p><p>It was more violent action than Tice had seen in the military, according to Enders. But the pair bonded over their profession and their recent divorces, and Tice would often share stories about his family. Once he interrupted a conversation among rebel fighters to tell them their plan to ambush a government convoy wasn’t well-planned enough.</p><p>Tice would subsequently win the George Polk Award for War Reporting, alongside Enders. But the pair eventually parted ways. Rebel forces were gaining control of the suburbs surrounding Damascus, the scene of violent fighting, and Tice wanted to get there in time to see the Assad regime collapse.</p><p>“It was extremely, extremely difficult and dangerous – the government was cutting off supply lines and transit routes,” Enders said. At one point he broke free of a rebel safehouse and started walking towards the city, until the rebel fighters retrieved him and locked him in a room for his own safety.</p><p>Tice called Sly to vent his frustration. “He was so convinced Assad was going to fall,” she said. “And he had to be there for it.”</p><p>That August, Tice turned 31. “Listening to the shells usher in my birthday,” he wrote on Twitter. He was in a reflective mood. “Afghanistan, California, DC, Egypt, Turkey, Syria. What an insane year.”</p><p>The year ended with Tice unwinding at a pool party with FSA rebels, according to a post from him in the early hours of August 12. Taylor Swift’s music blared in the background; Tice was an unabashed Swift fan. “Hands down, best birthday ever,” he wrote.</p><p>That was the last tweet he’d send. In Beirut, Sly heard from an editor at the Post, where Tice had filed a fourth dispatch. “Austin hasn’t answered his questions,” the editor told Sly. “He always does. Have you heard from him?”</p><p>It took a few days for concern to set in. Tice had been planning some R&R, and perhaps he was on his way to Lebanon or Turkey to take a break.</p><p>But as the days passed, it became clear that Tice had been captured. Sly, Enders and the other journalists Tice had befriended during his rapid professional rise frantically reached out to their contacts, but nobody knew what had happened to him.</p><p>Back home, the Tices were on a family vacation in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Austin had been in contact throughout his time in Syria – he knew his siblings and his parents were worried about him – so it didn’t take long for something to feel off.</p><p>“It’s one of those moments in our family’s history where there’s a before and there’s an after,” Abigail told CNN.</p><p>They cut the trip short, and over the ensuing weeks, the phone on their wall in Houston never stopped ringing. Media members quickly converged outside their house. It was overwhelming, Abigail said.</p><p>Both Sly and Enders had nightmares about their colleague. “There was one where he was in a forest, and people were shooting at him, and I had to warn him,” Sly remembered.</p><p>Then, in September, a video appeared on YouTube. The shaky footage showed Tice, blindfolded, weeks after his disappearance. He recited a garbled prayer in Arabic, then added, in English: “Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.” The video apparently showed him surrounded by jihadi militants, but the US quickly reached the conclusion that it had been staged by forces loyal to Assad.</p><p>Marc Tice, Austin’s father, said in a statement at the time that seeing the video was “difficult,” but “knowing Austin is alive and well is comforting to our family.”</p><p>No footage of Tice has been seen since, but the family never lost that hope.</p><p>“We know he’s alive and we know that eventually he will be home and our family will be together again,” Abigail said. “We’ve never doubted it once.”</p><p>Austin’s disappearance transformed his mother, Debra, into a geopolitical crusader overnight. She has met with successive US Presidents and told CNN earlier this year that President Trump’s team started reaching out to her soon after his election victory last November, describing their work on the case as “fantastic.”</p><p>As time has worn on, his mother’s resolve has only grown. “Debra Tice is a force of nature,” the longtime family friend told CNN. “This woman’s singular focus in life is amazing, and it’s inspiring.”</p><p>Then, in December, came renewed hope. Assad’s regime dramatically and decisively fell to rebel fighters, twelve years after Austin Tice believed it would. In the days that followed, Debra wrote a letter to several leaders – including Russian President Vladimir Putin – who gave the fallen despot sanctuary after he fled Syria.</p><p>Her letter elicited a public response from Putin, who said at his end-of-year press conference that he would talk to Assad about Tice’s whereabouts.</p><p>“I’ve never seen somebody with the guts to stand up to any world leader, to anyone, to say the things that she has said to people to try and get her son out,” the Tices’ family friend said.</p><p>CNN confronts the man who held Austin Tice captive</p><p>Thirteen years after he vanished, Austin Tice’s fate may never truly be known. His disappearance still haunts those who knew him. It changed Sly’s approach to hiring freelancers — “You can’t just take people (who) bound into the country with no background or experience,” she told CNN. She also asks herself: “Could we have done more?”</p><p>But Tice knew he was dancing with danger, and those close to him all acknowledge one thing: Once he set his heart on something, trying to change his mind was impossible.</p><p>“Every person in this country fighting for their freedom wakes up every day and goes to sleep every night with the knowledge that death could visit them at any moment. They accept that reality as the price of freedom,” Tice wrote on Facebook less than three weeks before his disappearance.</p><p>“No, I don’t have a death wish - I have a life wish,” he continued. “Coming here to Syria is the greatest thing I’ve ever done, and it’s the greatest feeling of my life.”</p><p>Clarissa Ward, CNN’s chief international correspondent,  contributed to this story.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Children may be more likely to be diagnosed with autism and other neurodevelopment disorders if their mother had a Covid-19 infection while pregnant, according to a new study.</p><p>Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed more than 18,000 births that occurred in the Mass General Brigham health system between March 2020 and May 2021, assessing records for laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 tests among the mothers and for neurodevelopment diagnoses among their children through age 3.</p><p>They found that children born to mothers who had Covid-19 during pregnancy were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopment disorder than those born to mothers who did not have an infection while pregnant: more than 16% versus less than 10%, or a 1.3 times higher risk after adjusting for other risk factors.</p><p>Kennedy said there will be autism answers this month. With public health agencies in upheaval, autism advocates are alarmed</p><p>Overall, differences in risks were more pronounced among boys and in cases where the mother had a Covid-19 infection during the third trimester. Previous studies have suggested that male fetal brains are more susceptible to maternal immune responses, according to the authors of the new study, and the third trimester is a “critical window for brain development.”</p><p>The most common diagnoses included disorders in speech and motor function development and autism. About 2.7% of children born to mothers who had Covid-19 while pregnant were diagnosed with autism, compared with about 1.1% of others, according to the study, published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><p>The new findings are “particularly notable in light of their biological plausibility,” the researchers wrote. They build on previous research that identified potential pathways for a maternal Covid-19 infection to affect the developing fetal brain even without direct transmission.</p><p>“Parental awareness of the potential for adverse child neurodevelopmental outcomes after COVID-19 in pregnancy is key. By understanding the risks, parents can appropriately advocate for their children to have proper evaluation and support,” Dr. Lydia Shook, maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study, said in a news release.</p><p>Acetaminophen use during pregnancy not linked to autism, our study of 2.5 million children shows</p><p>About 1 in 31 children in the US was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, according to a report published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was published in April. The increase — up from 1 in 36 children in 2020 — continues a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition.</p><p>Earlier this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a “massive testing and research effort” to determine “what has caused the autism epidemic.”</p><p>In a news conference in September on the “cause of autism,” President Donald Trump — flanked by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other federal health leaders – said that use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.</p><p>Kennedy also has a history of comments linking autism and vaccines, despite strong evidence that the two are not connected.</p><p>Texas attorney general sues Tylenol makers, claiming links to autism</p><p>The timeframe of the new study – early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available – meant that ​the researchers were able to “isolate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and offspring neurodevelopment in an unvaccinated population.” About 93% of the mothers included in the assessment had not received any doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Strong infection-control policies at that time also helped reduce the potential for unreported or undetected Covid-19 cases, the researchers said.</p><p>“These findings highlight that COVID-19, like many other infections in pregnancy, may pose risks not only to the mother, but to fetal brain development,” Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General Brigham and senior author of the new study, said in a news release. “They also support the importance of trying to prevent COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and are particularly relevant when public trust in vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – is being eroded.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Happier people are more successful in their careers, have more fulfilling relationships and live longer, healthier lives, previous research has shown. Now, scientists say they have identified the “happiness threshold” needed for a country’s population as a whole to achieve certain health benefits.</p><p>Specifically, a nation’s happiness level can influence its people’s risk of premature death from chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and respiratory disease, according to a study published October 20 in the journal Frontiers in Medicine.</p><p>Kindness will make you happier than a higher salary, report shows</p><p>The research team used a scale called the Life Ladder to estimate the happiness levels of 123 countries. Zero represents the worst possible life imaginable and 10 the best.</p><p>Once a country surpassed a score of 2.7, its happiness was tied to a decrease in deaths due to chronic or noncommunicable diseases among people 30 to 70 years old, researchers found.</p><p>Scores ranged from 2.18 to 7.97, with an average of 5.45. The United States was among the countries analyzed, but individual Life Ladder scores weren’t published in the study. However, the 2025 World Happiness Report ranks the US as the world’s 24th-happiest country, with a score of 6.72.</p><p>“Policies that lift national Life-Ladder scores above the 2.7 threshold — through investments in health systems, anti-corruption reforms, social safety nets, and healthy urban environments — can initiate a reinforcing cycle of higher happiness and lower mortality,” lead study author Iulia Iuga said in an email.</p><p>“The evidence suggests that raising well-being while curbing obesity, alcohol use, and pollution could produce dual dividends: stronger happiness and healthier, longer lives.”</p><p>For countries at or above the 2.7 threshold, “improving well-being can measurably extend life expectancy when societies reach a basic level of stability and satisfaction,” said Iuga, a professor in the department of finance and accounting at 1 Decembrie 1918 University of Alba Iulia in Romania.</p><p>Iuga hopes her team’s work has implications for governing bodies and public health organizations that can influence happiness and health at the population level. She plans to continue her research by testing the happiness threshold against other health metrics, such as years lived with a disability.</p><p>Each 1% increase in well-being correlated to a 0.43% decrease in the chronic-disease mortality rate among adults 30 to 70 years old, according to the study.</p><p>This research adds to the existing body of literature linking happiness to health, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a distinguished professor of psychology and director of the Positive Activities and Well-Being Laboratory, or PAWLab, at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study.</p><p>“Traditionally, happiness is seen as a little bit of a luxury. It feels good,” Lyubomirsky said. The new study shows “that happiness could be the public health variable. It’s about more than just fun and pleasure.”</p><p>Happiness is but one facet of a person’s health. Genetic, behavioral and environmental factors also play a role in the risk of dying from chronic disease.</p><p>“We don’t want to leave people the impression that if only they were happier, they would be healthier, they would be fine,” Lyubomirsky said.</p><p>It’s also important to avoid placing blame, she said.</p><p>“You don’t want to say, ‘If you don’t live as long, then it’s your fault because you’re not happy enough,’” she said. Not to mention, you only have so much control over your happiness as it relates to where you live. You might be born into a politically unstable country through no fault of your own or unable to afford to move out of an area with poor air quality.</p><p>Having spent decades studying the well-being of individuals, Lyubomirsky said gauging the happiness of entire countries comes with challenges.</p><p>“It’s really hard,” she said. “You cannot get a sample of every single person in the country, so you want to make sure that’s a representative sample.”</p><p>Researchers cited incomplete data on countries in conflict and low-income nations as a limitation of the study.

Here are 5 habits to adopt</p><p>Saida Heshmati, director of the Human Emotion and Relationships across Time and Culture, or HEART Lab, at Claremont Graduate University in California, said happiness isn’t the word she’d use to describe what the study is trying to measure.</p><p>“When we say ‘happiness,’ people tend to think about experiencing more positive emotions — joy and having meaning in life and having a sense of accomplishment,” said Heshmati, also an assistant professor of psychology, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The (Life Ladder) doesn’t necessarily get into those components.”</p><p>Heshmati referred to the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale, sometimes called Cantril’s Ladder, a standardized well-being assessment that serves as the basis for the Life Ladder scores in the study.</p><p>“This isn’t about happiness as a fleeting emotion,” Heshmati said. “It’s really about this general life satisfaction cognitive evaluation, which is a reflection of whether societies are providing those material, social and psychological foundations for people to thrive.”</p><p>The authors of the new study pulled data about health factors including air pollution, body mass index and alcohol consumption from the Gallup World Poll, World Health Organization and World Development Indicators collected from 2006 through 2021.</p><p>Noncommunicable diseases accounted for at least 43 million deaths globally, or 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths, in 2021, according to WHO.

Here are 5 ways it can boost happiness</p><p>Eighty percent of premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases that year were attributed to four disease groups: heart disease (19 million deaths); cancer (10 million deaths); chronic respiratory disease (4 million deaths); and diabetes (2 million deaths).</p><p>Countries with higher per-person health spending — what a person spends on doctor visits and prescription medications, for example — generally exceeded the happiness threshold. Ethiopia had the lowest per-capita spending at $9 in 2006, while the US had the highest at $12,000 in 2021. The average across all countries evaluated was $1,300.</p><p>Heshmati likes to think of the happiness threshold as a stability threshold.</p><p>“When you’re below that threshold, it seems you’re in stress mode and survival mode,” she said, which can have physiological consequences.</p><p>While individual well-being adds up to represent the happiness of a nation, Heshmati cautions against applying the study’s conclusions to your own health and risk of death from chronic disease.</p><p>“We can’t just say that becoming or feeling slightly happier directly changes your biology,” she said.</p><p>How to flourish –– even when you aren’t at your happiest, according to research</p><p>Heshmati recommends thinking about your own happiness holistically. Simple pleasures matter, she said, but they come and go and can leave a sense of emptiness due to their fleeting nature.

{"details":"<p>By Will Dunham</p><p>A handout illustration shows a pack of the dinosaur Nanotyrannus attacking a juvenile Tyrannosaurus in what is now Montana 67 million years ago. Anthony Hutchings/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES. Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab</p><p>WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - At the twilight of the age of dinosaurs, an agile and vicious predator named Nanotyrannus prowled western North America, resembling a smaller version of Tyrannosaurus - about a tenth the body mass - but with several key anatomical differences.</p><p>That is the finding of new research concluding that Nanotyrannus - which for years has been at the center of a debate among paleontologists as to whether it was merely a teenage version of Tyrannosaurus - was, in fact, its own distinct dinosaur.</p><p>The researchers examined fossil specimens of Nanotyrannus unearthed in 1942, 2001 and 2006 in Montana dating to about 67 million years ago, determining that the individuals were mature and not juveniles based on traits in the bones including annual growth rings.</p><p>They also found that Nanotyrannus differed anatomically from its larger cousin by having more teeth, a crest in front of its eyes, an air sinus in a certain bone at the back of the skull and the presence of a vestigial third finger, unlike the two-fingered Tyrannosaurus.</p><p>Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus both were members of a lineage of meat-eating dinosaurs called tyrannosaurs, but were not the same genus, the researchers said. A genus is a group of closely related species that share similar characteristics. For example, lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are from the same genus, Panthera, but each represents a different species.</p><p>The genus name Tyrannosaurus means \"tyrant lizard,\" with the species name \"rex\" meaning \"king.\" The genus name Nanotyrannus means \"dwarf tyrant.\"</p><p>\"T. rex was a massive predator adapted to wielding incredible bite forces. Nanotyrannus was a slender, agile pursuit predator that could have run circles around the tyrant king,\" said paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Nature, opens new tab.</p><p>The new analysis ends the debate around Nanotyrannus, Zanno said.</p><p>\"It is not biologically possible to conclude that it is a juvenile T. rex,\" Zanno said.</p><p>Their size difference was stark. Nanotyrannus had about 10% the body mass - about 1,500 pounds (700 kg) versus 15,000 pounds (7,000 kg). And it had about half the linear dimensions - approximately 18 feet (5.5 meters) versus roughly 40 feet (12.2 meters) long, and 7 feet (2 meters) versus 13 feet tall.</p><p>\"Nanotyrannus and T. rex are extremely different,\" said paleontologist and anatomist James Napoli of Stony Brook University in New York, co-author of the study.</p><p>Nanotyrannus was a predator built for speed and agility, with long legs, a long snout with blade-like teeth and strong arms for manipulating prey. Tyrannosaurus was a colossal predator that was built for strength, with stocky legs, an enormous head, thick, banana-shaped teeth and greatly reduced arms.</p><p>\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli said.</p><p>The researchers also determined that the Nanotyrannus specimens had sufficient anatomical differences to be divided into two separate species - Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named Nanotyrannus lethaeus. One of the Nanotyrannus fossils was part of the well-known \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" specimen, battling the horned dinosaur Triceratops at the time of death.</p><p>Some scientific research into how Tyrannosaurus matured was based on the notion that the Nanotyrannus fossils represented T. rex juveniles, including studies that hypothesized that this apex predator experienced an extreme growth rate.</p><p>\"For decades, paleontologists have unknowingly used Nanotyrannus specimens as a model for teenage T. rex to understand the biology of Earth's most famous dinosaur. Those studies need a second look,\" Zanno said.</p><p>The finding that Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus shared the same landscape, along with myriad plant-eating dinosaurs, offers the latest evidence that dinosaur diversity was rich prior to the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that ended the age of dinosaurs.</p><p>\"This discovery shows us that dinosaurs continued to evolve, innovate and diversify right up until their reign was cut short. This fits into a growing body of evidence proving that dinosaurs were not declining for millions of years before they went extinct, contrary to what we once thought,\" Napoli said.</p>","headline":"Agile and vicious Nanotyrannus was not just a teenage T. rex","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/science/agile-vicious-nanotyrannus-was-not-just-teenage-t-rex-2025-10-30/","message":""}

Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Read more</p><p>CAIRO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Egyptian officials are hoping the inauguration of a vast new museum on Saturday will accelerate the revival of a tourism industry hampered for more than a decade by internal upheaval, a pandemic and regional conflicts.</p><p>Officials believe the Grand Egyptian Museum, or GEM, alone could draw as many as 7 million additional visitors annually after it opens on Saturday, helping boost total visitors to around 30 million by 2030.</p><p>Overlooking the Giza Pyramids, the 500,000-square-meter edifice will house tens of thousands of artefacts, including what is billed as the complete collection of the treasures of the boy-king Tutankhamun, many displayed for the first time.</p><p>The new space includes immersive exhibits and virtual-reality devices, in contrast to cluttered, old-fashioned displays in the older Egyptian Museum in downtown Cairo.</p><p>Egypt, which has needed repeated bailouts to stabilise its economy, uses the foreign currency it collects from tourism to pay for crucial imports such as fuel and wheat.</p><p>Last year the country drew 15.7 million visitors who spent a record $15 billion, according to official figures. Tourism had collapsed to a low of $3.8 billion in 2015/16, the victim of extended political turmoil after Egypt's 2011 uprising.</p><p>However, factors including fraying infrastructure, poor planning and security restrictions have held back the tourism sector's potential. Even with the recent recovery, Egypt trails regional rival Turkey, which said it had more than 50 million international visitors last year, bringing in over $60 billion.</p><p>Ghada Abdelmoaty, an associate professor at the Higher Institute of Tourism and Hotels in Alexandria, said visitor targets were realistic.</p><p>\"The museum accommodates a huge collection that was previously kept in storage due to lack of display space,\" she said.</p><p>Popular with many travellers for its Red Sea resorts, Egypt hopes the GEM's opening will also draw an increasing proportion of cultural tourists.</p><p>Such tourists typically stay longer and spend more than those who come mainly for beaches, analysts say.</p><p>Official figures don't say how many tourists come for cultural reasons, but a 2021 study of GEM's possible impact estimated they made up less than a quarter of the total.</p><p>Abdelmoaty put the number of cultural tourists at only 10-15% of all international travellers.</p><p>Remon Naguib, chief commercial officer at Orient Hospitality Group, said his company was working to integrate the new museum into \"joint programmes\" designed to attract visitors to experience both.</p><p>Tourists could \"come and visit the museum, then spend three nights in a Red Sea destination, including Ain Sukhna, which is just one hour from Cairo,\" he said.</p><p>Tourism revenues became even more important over the last two years as attacks on Red Sea shipping chased shipping away from the Suez Canal, another major foreign currency earner.</p><p>Tourism itself has proven vulnerable to shocks including political violence in the 1990s and 2000s, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine – two countries which accounted for nearly a third of tourist arrivals in 2021. Tourism has also been hurt by the war in Gaza.</p><p>To fully capitalise on the GEM's opening, the museum \"has to be complemented by very high-quality tourist infrastructure – hotels, transport, and beyond,\" said Ragui Assaad, professor of international economic policy at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>That means addressing issues like transport in Cairo, a megacity with an estimated population of 23 million. Roads leading to the new museum have been given a facelift, while a new airport has been built about 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the GEM to circumvent clogged streets.</p><p>Entrance to the Giza Pyramids has been relocated to the back side to reduce crowding and keep visitors away from the area's famously aggressive tourist touts.</p><p>Tourism Minister Sherif Fathy said last month Egypt had added 5,000 hotel rooms to its existing 235,000 and hoped to add yet another 9,000 before the year ends.</p>","headline":"Egypt hopes vast new museum by the Pyramids will accelerate tourism revival","level":"info","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-hopes-vast-new-museum-by-pyramids-will-accelerate-tourism-revival-2025-10-30/","message":""}

{"details":"<p>Leather has been a staple of human fashion for millennia, but the fashion industry is increasingly embracing more sustainable alternatives.</p><p>Traditional leather comes mainly from cows, and cattle farming is linked to deforestation, habitat loss and land degradation. The tanning process is polluting and can use up to 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of water for each ton of raw animal hides.</p><p>Vegan and lab-grown leathers are on the rise, but one US company is supplying fashion houses with the real thing — only rather than using cattle, it’s sourced from invasive exotic animals.</p><p>Pythons from Florida’s Greater Everglades, silverfin carp from the Mississippi River Basin and lionfish from Caribbean reefs are the three alien invasive species that Miami-based startup Inversa currently harvests. The leather it produces is eventually turned into products such as clothing, bags and other accessories by fashion brands such as Gabriela Hearst, Khaite, Catherine Holstein and Johanna Ortiz.</p><p>“This all starts with a fish,” said Inversa CEO Aarav Chavda, who co-founded the company in 2020. “I’ve been a scuba diver for almost 15 years now, and I’ve just been obsessed with the problem of the invasive lionfish and what it’s doing to coral reefs throughout the Caribbean and the Mediterranean — taking a sledgehammer to native biodiversity on those reefs.”</p><p>Invasive species are animals and plants that are introduced due to human activity to an area where they are not native. They end up harming the local ecosystem, for example by eating native species, spreading disease or outcompeting other organisms for food or resources. They can cause extinctions and irreversible damage to the environment.</p><p>“My co-founders and I firmly believed that one way to solve this problem was to tap into the power of the consumer,” Chavda added. “We then zeroed in on the fashion industry — it really wants to do better and it’s looking for healthier and more sustainable feedstock materials. We ended up turning the lionfish into leather, and that was the genesis of this wonderful idea. I’m here to make a structural impact on invasives, which the UN considers to be a top five driver of biodiversity loss.”</p><p>After an initial focus on the lionfish, Inversa started harvesting silverfin, a carp native to China that was imported in the US in the 1970s, mostly to control algae in municipal sewage lagoons. However, it soon escaped into the wild: “In the Mississippi river ecosystem it’s completely decimating native biodiversity,” Chavda said. “It consumes an unbelievable amount of native vegetation and biomass and it’s now in several US states — it’s a major problem.”</p><p>The Burmese python soon followed: “It’s a constrictor snake originally from Southeast Asia, which was released into the Florida Everglades in the 1990s,” Chavda said. The snakes, likely from the pet trade, quickly multiplied and turned into super-predators, leading to the collapse of the populations of native mammals like raccoons, opossums and bobcats.</p><p>Inversa manages a network of hunters who procure the invasive species, and then processes the skins in three tanning facilities — two in Europe and one in the US. The system is managed through a digital platform called Origin, which integrates real-time field data, satellite imagery, predictive modeling, and AI-driven invasion mapping, with the goal of streamlining the operation and allowing traceability of every product: “Invasive species are a 21st century ecological crisis whose management cannot be solved with outdated, fragmented approaches,” Chavda said.</p><p>“We are building a completely transparent, traceable and verifiable supply chain, all the way back to the hunting itself.”</p><p>Chavda noted the tanning process is different from using cow hide — especially for fish skin, which is made up of very thin but also very strong fibers.</p><p>He added that Inversa is working with about 50 fashion brands and will soon expand into even more species, which he plans to announce next year. The company mandates that the final products mention either its name or the fact that the leather is sourced from an invasive species, and it states that this method of leather production offers an 89% improvement on carbon emissions and brings land use to almost zero.</p><p>Inversa said that it adheres to humane killing practices and is backed by American nonprofit environmental organization Conservation International and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others.</p><p>Chavda said Inversa has removed tens of thousands of invasive animals. However, there is no definitive assessment on the effect of these removals on the habitats: “In the Everglades, we’re seeing anecdotal increases in native mammals in the areas we’re hitting hard, from our hunters. We can definitely tell that the alleviated pressure is helping.”</p><p>Inversa’s work was assessed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Switzerland, which found it had a positive impact on biodiversity.</p><p>“Despite contributing to 60% of species extinctions and causing $423 billion in economic damages annually, invasive species remain largely overlooked in conservation funding,” said Sybille Borner of WWF Switzerland. “The (assessment) highlights Inversa’s ability to fill parts of this critical gap, demonstrating how fashion can be an unexpected yet powerful force for biodiversity.”</p><p>Alexandra Ioanid, an associate professor at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest, Romania, who has done research on invasive species and is not involved with Inversa, said that turning invasive species into a valuable material addresses two challenges at once: “It helps reduce the ecological damage caused by species that threaten native ecosystems, and it offers a more sustainable alternative to conventional leather. Technically, it’s exciting to see that leather made from invasive species can reach the quality and versatility required for real-world use.”</p><p>With the right tanning methods, Ioanid added, these alternative leathers can perform on par with traditional materials — and have a distinctive texture and aesthetic of their own: “If done responsibly, such initiatives can create economic incentives for removing invasive species, support local livelihoods, and contribute to conservation goals. The key is maintaining traceability and ecological oversight to ensure that these materials genuinely help manage invasives rather than encouraging new harvesting.”</p><p>However, selling materials sourced from wildlife, non-native or not, can stimulate markets that promote unrestricted or incentivized killing, encourage intensive wildlife farming and trigger unintended consequences, such as the deliberate release of these species to sustain supply, according to PJ Smith, fashion policy director for Humane World for Animals, a nonprofit that fights animal cruelty.</p><p>“Wildlife conservation efforts should prioritize the development of effective nonlethal management strategies that provide long-term solutions to address negative impacts from non-native species over fueling demand for luxury goods. There is a growing consumer demand for true, sustainable, bio-based leather alternatives that are animal-free and help restore ecosystems without the exploitation,” Smith added.</p><p>Deah Lieurance, an assistant professor of Invasive Species Biology and Management at Penn State University, said that the populations of invasive species that Inversa harvests are so high that she’s doubtful the company could have any significant impact on restoration: “I do think these types of projects do have one major benefit,” she added, “they bring greater public awareness to the wicked problem of biological invasion.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump has the ability to fill roughly 4,000 politically appointed positions in the executive branch and independent agencies, including more than 1,300 that require Senate confirmation. The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service are tracking nominees for roughly 800 of those positions.</p><p>Each nominee must pass through several steps before the position is filled, including a formal nomination, a referral to at least one Senate committee, a committee hearing and an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.</p><p>Nominees who were confirmed during the Biden administration were presumed to have resigned unless they were serving in a termed position or publicly available information indicates they have continued serving into the Trump administration.</p><p>The tracker is maintained by The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan good-governance organization. Researchers at the Partnership for Public Service follow presidential and congressional actions on approximately 800 top executive branch positions, a portion of more than 1,300 positions that require Senate confirmation.</p><p>The tracker includes all full-time, civilian positions in the executive branch that require Senate confirmation except for judges, marshals and U.S. attorneys. Military appointments and part-time positions requiring Senate confirmation are not included.</p><p>There are officials who were confirmed during previous administrations for fixed periods of time and continue to serve because their terms have not expired.</p><p>The tracker does not show officials serving in an acting capacity, so positions unfilled by Trump are not necessarily vacant. All presidents appoint some temporary officials to Senate-confirmed positions to preserve continuity during transitions between one confirmed official and another. While acting officials for high-profile positions are often widely reported, temporary officials for lesser known positions are often not reported publicly — or are done so inconsistently.</p><p>The numbers in the tracker capture nonconcurrent positions. For example, a nomination to be the ambassador of the General Assembly of the United Nations and a separate nomination to be the representative of the United States in the U.N. Security Council are considered a single nomination.</p><p>The tracker will be updated daily as positions are considered and filled. When the frequency of confirmations decreases, the tracker will be updated on a weekly basis.</p><p>Presidents formally nominate individuals to the Senate to fill each position, a responsibility established in the Constitution. The Senate refers most nominations to a specific committee with jurisdiction over the position. Committees scrutinize the nominees and hold hearings to discuss their views, qualifications and histories. After the hearing, committees usually take a vote on whether to report out the nomination favorably, unfavorably or without recommendation. Or they can vote to take no action on the nomination.</p><p>A nomination generally goes to the full Senate for a final vote if a majority of the committee votes favorably, but this isn’t required to get a final vote. Many nominations are approved through a unanimous consent agreement that limits debate and speeds up the process. For nominees subject to a vote, a simple majority is necessary to win confirmation. The Senate has rules that allow for individual senators to voice concerns about the nomination process.</p><p>Most nominations that go to the Senate are ultimately successful. However, some do not receive a Senate vote, either because their nominations are withdrawn by the president or because the Senate calendar year ends before a vote takes place. By law, nominations not confirmed by the end of the year are automatically withdrawn, and the president must resubmit them to be considered again the following congressional session.</p><p>Most of the information regarding nominations and the Senate’s process comes from Congress.gov, the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. Information about Senate-confirmed positions generally comes from the “United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions,” known as the Plum Book, published by Congress every four years. However, each administration may add new positions and organizations, or change position titles. The tracker reflects those changes when they are made public.</p><p>Information on resignations and informal appointee announcements comes from publicly available sources such as news stories and government websites. The government does not publish any single, up-to-date source of information on the status of these positions. In some cases, public information on the status of certain officials or positions is inconsistent or nonexistent. The information provided in this tracker is based on the best publicly available details.</p><p>There’s a slight chance. The Partnership for Public Service and The Post have staff members and processes devoted to following nomination and confirmation developments. However, the federal government does not have a uniform method of reporting appointee employment statuses, and occasionally, a change will occur with little or no media coverage. It is possible changes will occur that are not yet identified in the tracker, especially for lower-profile positions.

{"details":"<p></p><p>Lean in. Pop on your favorite headphones. I have a story for you. It’s the first great story I’ve heard, and it still haunts me after 26 years as a reporter.</p><p>The story stays alive through sound. So it’s important you hear the voices. We’ve put together a full audio telling of the Ghost of Mrs. Kyle, complete with a crackly recording of an unconventional woman, who was drawn to ghosts and added to the story. We also recorded audio on the grounds of the girls’ boarding school where this tale takes place as I try to make my way up a creaky staircase.</p><p>Enjoy! And afterward, be sure to catch our favorite audience-submitted ghost story, involving a headless motorcycle rider.</p><p>Play — if you dare! — to hear the story of Mrs. Kyle and Miss Charlotte. Scroll to follow along.</p><p></p><p>The tale starts in a unique place: A private boarding school for girls in Loudoun County, Virginia. Five hundred acres of rolling Piedmont hills. I lived on campus. My father was the head cook. My mom was the baker and later ran the guest house.</p><p>This is horse country.</p><p>When the stars aren’t out, it’s dark. When the students are in their dorms, it’s dead quiet. The sound of your feet in the gravel echoes. It sounds like someone is following you.</p><p>Steps from the dining hall, there’s an orchard. And on the edge of the orchard, there’s a tree. And under that tree, Mrs. Kyle was buried … twice.</p><p>Now, this story is more legend than fact, said to be handed down for nearly 300 years.</p><p>Our sole source is the school’s founder, Charlotte Haxall Noland, who told the story until the day she died.</p><p>In colonial Virginia, a Mrs. Kyle lived in a brick home near an orchard with her husband. And like many good tales in this area of the country, there is a tie to a Founding Father — one of the original American influencers to lend extra weight to this kind of story.</p><p>So in this one, Mrs. Kyle is connected to Mary Ball Washington, the mother of none other than George Washington. According to Miss Charlotte, Mrs. Kyle’s maiden name was Ball, a prominent colonial Virginia surname.</p><p>In a legend such as this, who’s to say the truth of it all?</p><p>Anyway, Mrs. Kyle had a baby … and reportedly went “crazy.” (Now, we’d call it postpartum depression.) And the treatment? Chaining her inside her own attic.</p><p>How long she was chained there, how she reacted to her confinement, if she saw her newborn or even what happened to that baby — that’s never been a part of the story. Now, her prison, the attic, still exists. It’s atop a creaky wooden staircase on the third floor of what was their brick house.</p><p>She would never leave her home alive.</p><p>It was summer. Her husband was away on business. And somehow, the story goes, Mrs. Kyle got free from those chains, ran down the stairs, tripped, broke her neck and died. Due to the heat, she was immediately buried in the orchard, outside the veranda of the couples’ brick home.</p><p>Years passed.</p><p>The Revolutionary War swept through the land.</p><p>Almost a hundred years passed.</p><p>Regiments of the Civil War marched through.</p><p>The Battle of Middleburg — 14 days before Gettysburg.</p><p>Another century turned.</p><p>In the early 1900s, along comes a woman: Miss Charlotte Haxall Noland. A remarkable spirit in her own right, and, as you’ll hear in a second, our narrator of the legend. She was born nearby. Her family owned land in the same region.</p><p>She spent her childhood riding horses, was presented at a debutante ball in Richmond, studied physical education at Harvard, went abroad to study at Oxford and eventually came back to the United States, determined to start a school.</p><p>In September 1914, she opened a boarding school that she dubbed Foxcroft. She never married. Devoted herself wholly to the school, where to this day she’s affectionately known as Miss Charlotte. Every Halloween season, the Foxcroft students walk deep into the woods to gather around the grave of Miss Charlotte to hear the legend their school’s founder kept alive in a distinctly spirited fashion.</p><p>This is the voice of Miss Charlotte, recorded sometime before her death in 1969:</p><p>“So when I was a very little girl, my grandfather used to tell me about the ghost of Mrs. Kyle. How she walked all around this big place. I’ve always liked ghosts and tales about them.”</p><p>From her childhood, in the late 1800s, Miss Charlotte was fascinated by tales of ghost stories. Specifically the tale of Mrs. Kyle. She said it led her to start her school on that very land.</p><p>“... and she was part of the reason I wanted to get it. Because, as I tell you, I like ghosts.”</p><p>Miss Charlotte lived in the same old brick house that Mrs. Kyle lived in, was chained in and died in.</p><p>“And there’s no doubt about it, Mrs. Kyle was there.”</p><p>According to Miss Charlotte, Mrs. Kyle’s ghost visited her and school staff.</p><p>“She was kind and good. I could feel her right behind me, breathing on my neck as I walked up the steps. She’d go to a certain door there, and then she’d go on up in the garage and disappear.</p><p>Even Miss Raymond, the first big head of Foxcroft, who lived in the house at the top of the steps — I hadn’t told her about Mrs. Kyle at all — and she said to me, “What is this? Are these footsteps that stop at my door and then go on up the steps?”</p><p>There were a number of teachers who came to Foxcroft and people who worked there who knew there was something, some sort of spirit that moved around because I wasn’t the only one. I heard dozens of people talk to me about it. So you see, it wasn’t just my imagination.”</p><p>So … Miss Charlotte wondered if Mrs. Kyle had unfinished business to take care of in this world. Miss Charlotte decided to dig into it … literally.</p><p>“She was simply the spirit of a restless soul. Who couldn’t rest because they had something to tell us. What the something was, I had no idea.</p><p>But I made up my mind I was gonna find out.</p><p>So, I decided I would try to dig her up.</p><p>That was simply fascinating to the girls. So I told the ones who got the highest marks, they could come when I began to dig the graves. There was only about six girls. I got two good, stout men there, and we dug and dug and found nothing.</p><p>The next day, we let the whole countryside come. That was everybody in the school and all our friends. It really was a funny gathering. And we began in real earnestness, four men digging instead of two. And there, we hit Mrs. Kyle’s bones.</p><p>If you can imagine the excitement when they brought up the first ones: Nice little ladylike ribs. I was so glad to see them.</p><p>It didn’t take very long now. And excitement was something beyond any words. Alice Jones leaned so far over the grave, yelling and looking at it, that she fell in. I’ve always thought what a horrible thing it would have been to have to write and say, “Dear Mrs. Jones, I’m so sorry your child broke her neck falling into Mrs. Kyle’s grave.” For I had no right to dig up a grave anyway.</p><p>But she didn’t break anything. She stood down there and realized that the lump in front of her was Mrs. Kyle’s head, her skull. She it grabbed in her arms and two men who were down there, also in the coffin, in the grave, roped her under arms and they pulled her up.”</p><p>“I’ll never forget, if I live to be a million years old, her triumphant look as she came up out holding the skull of Mrs. Kyle. It was wonderful.</p><p>It was then, and right then, about 5:30 on a May afternoon, I found out the secret of why she wound [up] dead.</p><p>And I looked at the skull, holding it in my hands. She was shot right through the very top of her head, a big bullet hole.</p><p>And the day after that, I wrapped it all — the skull — up in a newspaper, and I took it to Washington to the Smithsonian Institute.</p><p>There's a ballistic department there. And I showed the skull to them. They took it and gave it the most minute examination. It's a wonderful place, that Smithsonian. There's nothing there they don't know, or if they don't know it, they can find it out.</p><p>And brought it back to me within about a half an hour. Saying it’s a pre-Revolutionary bullet hole. Now, didn’t that answer the whole question? It did for me.</p><p>You see, she did the most natural thing in the world. As she rushed down the steps, the man who was left to take care of her, just leaned over the banister and shot her right through the head.</p><p>It’s the only way it could have been done, absolutely right in the middle. And then being scared to death to tell the husband how he shot her and what he did, they arranged to have her break her neck, falling down the steps.”</p><p>I’ve come back to Foxcroft to give you a sense of the place.</p><p>I remember going to look for my best friends near those steps. We were always running in and out of that old brick house building, where our parents worked.</p><p>As kids we knew the story of Mrs. Kyle’s ghost and dared each other to climb the stairs and peek at chains that we were told remained in the attic floor. In fact, I lived there for nearly 16 years and only once screwed up the courage to climb that staircase.</p><p>I’m attempting it now … late at night.</p><p>But I have yet to walk through that attic door and look for the chains, myself.</p><p>I can see that door, that white door. And I’m not going up to the top of those stairs. There’s no reason for me to go up and bother that woman.</p><p>I leave those stairs and walk around the campus. Foxcroft is a special place, not just to me. For generations, parents have sent their daughters to be educated in the spirit of Miss Charlotte: Determined, athletic and independent.</p><p>The school is modeled after British boarding systems. Girls are sorted into houses. Here, it’s the foxes and the hounds. And they’ll be foxes and hounds for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Students learn dressage and showjumping alongside history and science. The two houses compete in sports like field hockey and basketball. Of course, I never attended this school. But I studied it.</p><p>The tradition I found most unique? Each Halloween, they learn about the ghost of Mrs. Kyle.</p><p>The ritual goes like this: The foxes and the hounds hold a skit competition and the upperclassmen walk the younger students deep into the woods, to a tiny cemetery. Many years, students hear the scratchy audio recording of Miss Charlotte. Other years, students pass the legend by word of mouth.</p><p>The recording takes on a different meaning when you’re in that context. I remember the first time I tagged along as a teenager, went down to the cemetery in the woods, holding a candle and hearing that tape.</p><p>Candle wax dripped on Miss Charlotte’s gravestone.</p><p>So, we need to finish this story…</p><p>After she’d dug up Mrs. Kyle’s bones, Miss Charlotte supposedly had the remains examined by the Smithsonian Institution — I found no record of this examination.</p><p>But, at the center of campus, there is a permanent marker that keeps the legend alive.</p><p>Steps from the brick house, there’s an orchard. And on the edge of the orchard, there’s a tree.</p><p>And under that tree, Mrs. Kyle was buried again.</p><p>“We collected her rib bones and the ones that we dug up, put them all in a huge great Mason jar. It’s a jar that used to be old time pickle jars.”</p><p>Miss Charlotte had put the bones inside of a pickle jar and reinterred them.</p><p>“... and that’s where she’s to stay for always.”</p><p>A bronze plaque marks the spot. It reads: Here lie the bones of Mrs. Kyle who lived in the old brick house and died circa 1730. Her ghost still haunts Foxcroft.</p><p>“Well, she’d gotten the story to us. She told what she wanted to, what we wanted to know and she wanted us to know. And now she rests right there under the tree at the back of the orchard house.”</p><p></p><p>Our second helping of ghosts comes to us from Washington Post reader Candace Grant of Longmont, Colorado.</p><p>Back in 1973, Grant came home from college. Her young brother convinced her to attempt to summon an Elmore, Ohio, legend: the headless motorcycle rider. Grant, a retired special education teacher, often rehashes memories of the trip with her brother as an adult. She says she leans into supernatural explanations of the story because, she admits, “it’s more fun than being skeptical.”</p><p>Try to suppress your goose bumps as you listen to Grant’s story with archival audio from WTOL11, Toledo.</p><p></p><p>My name is Candace Grant and I have a personal experience with the Headless Motorcycle Rider of Elmore, Ohio.</p><p>“Elmore, Ohio. Living population? About 1,300. As for the resident ghosts? Well, it all depends on who you talk to.”</p><p>According to this legend, the headless motorcycle rider was a soldier who had returned from World War I only to find the love of his life had married someone else. Heartbroken and furious, he sped off on his motorcycle and crashed. His head and the motorcycle’s headlight were never found.</p><p>Now, people said, his ghost would appear to anyone who called for him in just the right way.</p><p>“For years, the story has been in this farming area that if a certain signal is given, a light from the bike appears, and the ghost crosses the bridge once again.”</p><p>I was home for the summer from college. This was back in 1973. My family was living in Toledo and my brother kept talking about the headless motorcycle rider. He finally persuaded me to drive him and his friends out to see if we could summon that ghost.</p><p>I had four teenage boys crammed in my 1969 Volkswagen bug. One of their older brothers led us to the spot and instructed me to stop, flash my headlights three times, and wait.</p><p>Nothing happened. I tried again.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>I decided to turn around and drive back past the old farmhouse. The boys begged me to go back. So I did. This time a corn shock, a vertical pile, almost like in a tepee shape of corn, stood right in the middle of the road. Something that definitely hadn’t been there minutes earlier. I thought it was very, very strange. Like, what the heck is going on here?</p><p>So I drove around it, and we went back to the spot where we’d been waiting. I stopped the car and we started the signaling again. And again, nothing happened. I turned the car around, but this time the corn shock was scattered across the road. And the way it was scattered, it looked as though a car had driven through it.</p><p>We hadn’t seen another car at all that night.</p><p>I turned around, I flashed the headlights three times.</p><p>This time, in my side view mirror, I saw a single motorcycle headlight moving fast on a perpendicular road toward us. The light turned onto our road and sped closer and closer.</p><p>The boy screamed as I pushed the little car to its limit. It chased us.</p><p>Then suddenly, it faded away into darkness.</p><p>After that, our adrenaline was just going wild. And I turned around, we went past the farmhouse again. The corn stalk was still scattered and we headed home.</p><p>For the longest time, I’ve been thinking we were set up. I thought because we were led out there, I just had this feeling, but then I’ve read about the other people’s experiences on it, so I really don’t know what to make of it all. But it’s just fun memory. It is such a fun memory to have.</p><p>And I think I’d rather now think it was something supernatural as compared to a setup because it just makes the story a lot more fun rather than being skeptical.</p><p>— Candace Grant</p><p>About this story</p><p>Photos by Sarah L.

Without them, many Americans will face much higher costs before the midterm elections next fall — in some cases increases of more than a thousand dollars per month.</p><p>This funding is at the heart of the congressional fight that has left the government shut down for nearly a month.

Republicans have said they won’t consider an extension until the government is reopened.</p><p>The numbers in our charts and maps come from researchers at the health research group KFF, and reflect insurance prices published on healthcare.gov and state websites that allow people to “window shop” before Saturday, when insurance marketplaces will open for business.

This group includes many people close to the poverty line in states that didn’t expand their Medicaid program. Their insurance will remain heavily subsidized, just at the lower level established by the original Affordable Care Act legislation.</p><p>Although the price difference in dollars may look small, it can mean a lot for people who earn less than $2,000 a month. Since the enhanced subsidies became law, sign-ups in this lowest income group have tripled, with particularly large increases in Texas, Florida and Georgia. Some critics of the subsidies say the numbers have gotten so high that they are concerned about fraud.</p><p>People who earn a little more — $35,000 a year —are also facing relatively standard price increases around the country.

Without the extra subsidies, people will have to pay whatever insurers in their markets charge. People in this group tend to be self-employed or work for small businesses.</p><p>Because insurers are allowed to charge higher prices to older customers than younger ones, subsidies for Americans at this income level make the biggest difference for people close to retirement age. The large increases in the underlying insurance premiums — around 26 percent on average for a typical plan — pile on top of the lost subsidies.</p><p>Age 27</p><p>Age 40</p><p>Age 60</p><p>If subsidies</p><p>are extended</p><p>$460</p><p>$460</p><p>$460</p><p>If subsidies</p><p>expire</p><p>$540</p><p>$656</p><p>$1,380</p><p>Change</p><p>+$80</p><p>+$196</p><p>+$920</p><p>Age 27</p><p>Age 40</p><p>Age 60</p><p>$460</p><p>$460</p><p>$460</p><p>If subsidies are extended</p><p>If subsidies expire</p><p>$540</p><p>$656</p><p>$1,380</p><p>Change</p><p>+$80</p><p>+$196</p><p>+$920</p><p>Estimates are for the median county.

The subsidies kick in only when the cost of insurance is more than 8.5 percent of their income, which comes up only in the most expensive markets.</p><p>But some older people with high incomes do save money with the extra subsidies.

The math is a bit more complicated for people who are buying insurance for their whole family. But the basic patterns are similar: Families at lower incomes would face more uniform increases, while families at higher incomes would see variable price increases, depending on where they live and the age of each family member.</p><p>You can estimate your personal household costs with and without the subsidies using this calculator from KFF.</p><p>About the data</p><p>The numbers in our analysis come from researchers at the health research group KFF and are calculated using insurance premiums published on healthcare.gov and state insurance marketplaces as part of “window shopping” for the 2026 plan year. An earlier version of this article was published using estimated price increases for 2026, and showed similar though not identical numbers.</p><p>Consumer costs are calculated based on the price of the “benchmark” silver plan in each market, the second-least expensive plan that covers around 70 percent of the average enrollee’s medical costs. Individual consumers may pay more or less if they choose other plans in the market. Calculations account only for federal tax credits and do not include additional state subsidies, available for some consumers in several states.</p><p>In a handful of states, people earning $22,000 won't be immediately affected by subsidy changes because they qualify for different low-cost state insurance programs: Medicaid in Alaska, Hawaii and the District of Columbia; and the basic health plan in Minnesota, Oregon and New York (the basic health plan is Medicaid-like coverage with low premiums for a sliver of low-income Americans in certain states). New York residents earning $35,000 also currently qualify for the basic health plan.</p><p>The federal poverty level is higher in Alaska and Hawaii than in other states, which means the top income cutoff for subsidies in those states is higher than $63,000. That difference explains small differences in the average prices for people at $65,000 and $95,000 in income.</p><p>Advertisement</p>","headline":"How Much Obamacare Prices Are Rising Across the U.S.","level":"info","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/30/upshot/obamacare-subsidies-new-prices.html","message":""}

Blood spatters, footprints and tire marks are the only traces of the crime he has just committed, but a trace is all it takes for the hunter to become the hunted.</p><p>His arrest comes a short while later, courtesy of Shinga, a Belgian Malinois that perfectly retraced the poacher’s 2.8-mile (4.5-kilometer) route home, leading an anti-poaching team to his door.</p><p>Last October’s pursuit ultimately began much further afield, in the sleepy Welsh town of Carmarthen, where Shinga was born and raised. It’s home to the kennels of Dogs4Wildlife, a non-profit organization that trains dogs to support anti-poaching units (APUs) in their efforts to protect endangered wildlife across southern Africa.</p><p>It’s run by professional dog trainers Darren Priddle and Jacqui Law, who decided to blend their career experiences of developing working dogs for police, security, and military operations with their love of wildlife, after seeing photos of a poached African rhino on social media in 2015.</p><p>“It was quite a horrific image. We sat down and we said, ‘Okay, that’s really affected us,’” Priddle told CNN.</p><p>“We can deploy dogs in the UK to track people … to look for drugs, firearms and explosives, so why could we not look at developing the dogs that we were training for conservation efforts?”</p><p>The duo has since sent 15 dogs to five sub-Saharan African countries, including Mozambique and Tanzania, each one bred by them in southwest Wales.</p><p>They usually breed one or two litters each year. Dutch shepherds and Belgian Malinois are two of the most common breeds for tracking, while labradors and spaniels are typically the detection (sniffer) dogs of choice.</p><p>Training begins from as early as two days old. Priddle acknowledges that sounds young, but he believes early imprinting programs can provide a strong foundation for the formal training that commences around six weeks later.</p><p>“There’s a lot of scientific study out there that’s been documented on exposing puppies to touch, different temperatures, different surfaces and textures, as well as different odors that we put into the whelping box when they’re very young,” he explained</p><p>“It just helps their brain and (helps) their synapses to fire. We see a lot of advancement in those puppies.”</p><p>The curriculum closely follows that of the typical police or security dog, focusing on obedience, tracking, and scent detection – a skill used to sniff out rhino horn, elephant ivory and bushmeat.</p><p>The only key difference to the training process is acclimating dogs to the sights, sounds and smells of lions, giraffes and the myriad other species they will help protect. With rhino and elephant numbers severely lacking in the wetlands of Carmarthenshire, trips to local zoos are organized to desensitize the puppies to African wildlife.</p><p>Typically, after 16 to 18 months, dogs are ready for assignment. Even though Priddle accompanies each one on the long flight to their new home, spending the first month with the anti-poaching unit to provide field and animal welfare training to rangers, goodbyes never get easier.</p><p>“The transition from spending every waking moment with that dog, having a very strong relationship, to then letting that go is challenging and difficult,” Law said.</p><p>“But as much as it breaks my heart when they go, I know they’re going for the greater good.”</p><p>Easing the pain are WhatsApp group chats set up for Priddle and Law to keep in touch with and advise APUs across the various reserves and conservancies.</p><p>They are particularly active forums, especially given that the organization also provides training and consultancy to teams with existing dog units, such as the Akashinga Rangers, Africa’s first armed all-female anti-poaching squad, who watch over Zimbabwe’s vast Phundundu Wildlife Area.</p><p>Naturally, updates of success are a source of immense personal pride for the pair back in Wales. Shinga’s tracking triumph in October followed the achievements of fellow Belgian Malinois Dan, which in 2013 alerted his team to a rhino calf that had been caught in a snare trap in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.</p><p>Such victories demonstrate the “game-changing” value such dogs can have when incorporated into conservation efforts, argue the duo, even through their mere presence.</p><p>“When these reserves bring a specialist dog onto a wildlife reserve … the word spreads very quickly that the APUs now have the capability to actually catch these poachers on a more efficient and successful basis,” Priddle said.</p><p>“Some of the smaller wildlife reserves almost eradicate poaching in all types completely, just because of the deterrent value that dog brings to the party.”</p><p>As park manager and head of anti-poaching operations at Zimbabwe’s 10,000-acre Imire conservancy, Reilly Travers has had a front row seat for the last seven years to the impact of Shinga and also Murwi, a Dutch shepherd whose training was paid for by the fundraising efforts of pupils of the local Harare International school.</p><p>Capable of covering as much as 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) an hour when tracking, even in darkness, dogs allow rangers to “own the night,” Travers explained, adding an invaluable level of versatility and unpredictability to their arsenal.</p><p>And on numerous occasions Shinga and Murwi have alerted units to potentially mortal threats – be it from poachers or predators – through body language alone.</p><p>“They’ve saved our guys on the ground on several occasions and they’ve been responsible for apprehending quite a few poachers,” Travers told CNN.</p><p>“It’s had a massive impact on security for Imire. We’ve had a drastic reduction in poaching and the K9 unit has a massive role to play in that … It’s not the silver bullet but it’s a tool that will make a significant difference.”</p><p>Zimbabwe once boasted thousands of rhinos, yet numbers nosedived to less than 450 by 1992 because of poaching networks, according to conservation charity Save the Rhino.</p><p>The efforts of Imire, which saw the birth of its 23rd rhino in 2023, helped the country’s rhino population climb back over the 1,000-mark in 2022, but statistics continue to make for grim reading across the wider continent.</p><p>Though the numbers of African rhinos poached annually has dropped steadily since a peak of over 1,300 in 2015, almost 600 kills were still recorded last year, according to Save the Rhino. It contributed to an overall decline in the total African black rhino population in 2023, though white rhino numbers are on the rise.</p><p>And the impact of each loss extends far beyond statistics, Priddle and Law explain, especially at the smaller reserves that Dogs4Wildlife focuses on, which have markedly less anti-poaching resources than the continent’s most renowned parks.</p><p>Related gallery\n      Black rhino: Back from the brink</p><p>Recalling the sight of a de-horned 25-year-old bull rhino and eight-year-old male in Limpopo, both killed by a single poacher, Law stressed the knock-on effect on the wider environment.</p><p>“The vegetation they clear, the seeds they disperse, all the other animals that are impacted. You think it’s just a rhino that’s gone – it’s the whole ecosystem that suffers,” Law explained.</p><p>“The owners of that reserve had a relationship with that bull for 25 years – we grieve when we lose a dog after 10 to 15 years. For us to experience the impact that losing those two rhinos had on the reserve owner sort of gave us added motivation.</p><p>“It was just horrific. I never want to see that again.”</p><p>As Dogs4Wildlife looks ahead to its long-term goal of one day opening a specialized training and canine school within Africa, mobilizing future generations has become a key part of its overall mission.</p><p>Its Conservation club, called Siyafunda Ngemvelo – which translates to “we learn in nature” in IsiZulu – has taken more than 180 South African children into reserves as part of a wildlife education program.</p><p>Law said that for local people to want to protect rhinos, they must first see the animals’ value to the environment.</p><p>“We have to start at the fundamental basics, which is children taking responsibility for their own wildlife,” she added.</p><p>“Once they get the passion for it, they’re going to become future rangers, not future poachers.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Ralph Ziman estimates he was 13 or 14 years old the first time he had a gun pulled on him in anger. It was the mid 1970s, and he was with friends outside a shopping mall in the northern suburbs of his hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa. Someone may have looked the wrong way at a stranger’s girlfriend – his memory is fuzzy. What isn’t fuzzy is the sight of that stranger pointing a .45 Magnum in their direction.</p><p>Luckily the situation de-escalated, and everyone walked away that day. But Ziman estimates by the time he was 50 he’d had a gun pulled on him 15 to 20 times. “I have to consider myself really lucky,” he said. Unsurprisingly, he said he’s “always been very anti-gun.”</p><p>Ziman is a commercial photographer and filmmaker-turned-artist who resides in Los Angeles today. For over a decade he has made weapons the focus of his work, using tens of millions of hand-threaded beads to turn artifacts of war into artworks.</p><p>“I want to talk about the proliferation of weapons around the world and the militarization of police forces,” he explained.</p><p>His series “Weapons of Mass Production” recently concluded with Ziman’s most ambitious work to date: an entire fighter jet.</p><p>Each artwork in the series has its own connection to South Africa’s recent past, and together they comprise a beautiful, subversive meditation on a nation’s history of violence.</p><p>First, he created dozens of mock AK-47 rifles in 2013, adding beads to a wire frame. The AK-47, Ziman said, started as “weapon of liberation” during the apartheid years, then post-apartheid “started showing up in bank robberies, cash-in-transit robberies, home invasions (and) carjackings.”</p><p>Next, in 2016, Ziman moved on to bedecking a Casspir – a heavily armored, mine-resistant vehicle that was created for the South African police and deployed in townships, which became “a hated symbol of apartheid,” he explained.</p><p>In 2019, Ziman took on the challenge of beading an entire MiG-21. Why he chose the Soviet era fighter jet – the most produced military jet in the world – requires a little more explanation. In the 1980s, South Africa was involved in both the Angola Civil War (1975-2002) and the South African Border War (1966-1990). The Cold War proxy conflicts pulled in multiple entities, including Cuba, which flew MiG-21s against South Africa’s air force, inflicting loses in what proved a costly venture, financially and politically, for South Africa.</p><p>Ziman and a team of over 100 artisans took more than five years to complete the artwork, which was revealed at The Museum of Flight in Seattle this summer.</p><p>First, Ziman had to acquire a jet, which was sourced from a military contractor in Lakeland, Florida.</p><p>“It was in pieces and not in great condition, but it was absolutely perfect for us,” he said. Ziman’s team removed the engine, loaded the rest onto a flatbed truck and took it to his studio in LA.</p><p>Much of the design work was completed on the plane itself, using sheets of paper stuck to its aluminum panels. These sheets would be detailed using colored tape, then removed and shipped to South Africa. There, artisans from Zimbabwean and Ndebele communities in Johannesburg, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces began to recreate the panels in beads.</p><p>The largest of the panels were over 20 feet wide and weighed 30-40 pounds once completed. The team estimates the jet, which is 51 feet long and 24 feet wide, is covered in approximately 35 million beads.</p><p>“There’s no mechanized way of doing this, everything on that plane is 100% handmade,” said Ziman. “I can’t even begin to think about the hours that have gone into it.”</p><p>There are easier, quicker ways of adding a splash color. Why beads?</p><p>“I’d always loved beadwork,” said Ziman. “I’d grown up with it; I had an Ndebele nanny who always brought us beaded stuff.</p><p>“Even though it took a tremendous amount of skill and this tremendous effort to make anything out of beads, it was looked down on. I always wanted to elevate it to being a fine art.”</p><p>Many of the artisans employed by Ziman are part of Anointed Hands, a collective of beadworkers overseen by Thenjiwe Pretty Nkogatsi. ﻿“She is intensely passionate about keeping these beading skills alive in the Ndebele community,” he said.</p><p>Preserving the livelihoods of these artisans became paramount during the Covid-19 pandemic, when other work dried up, said Ziman. But “Weapons of Mass Production” is also out to help the next generation.</p><p>Through DTCare, the charity arm of international logistics firm DTGruelle (which supported the MiG-21 project), 25 of the artisans’ children and other young people are receiving sponsorship for their education.</p><p>“We will pay for them through school, through university … as far as they want to go,” said Ziman. So far, scholarship students have studied medicine, nursing and fashion design, and one even plays for Zimbabwe’s under-21 cricket team, the artist added, beaming.</p><p>The MiG-21 will go up for sale after a US tour, he said, with proceeds funding the education program, as well as art therapy for children in Ukraine.</p><p>“I love the idea that we take this thing that was built in the Soviet Union … has been donated to us, and we can sell it and put some of that money back into helping some of the civilian population who’ve been so brutalized in the war (with Russia),” he added.</p><p>Despite his series looking into South Africa’s past, Ziman believes it has ongoing relevance. The project, he said, “is maybe even more pertinent now than when we started.”</p><p>He highlighted the Casspir police vehicle, one of the inspirations for US military MRAP (Mine Resistance Ambush Protected) vehicles used in the Second Gulf War. Hundreds of US military mine-resistant vehicles would eventually be made available to police departments through the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, and some used on US streets against protestors during the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>“History doesn’t just rhyme, it actually seems to repeat itself,” said Ziman.</p><p>This story has been updated to clarify the description of the Casspir vehicle and the beadwork artisans.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump has said it is “pretty clear” the US Constitution does not permit him to run for the third term in office, after days of speculation prompted by claims from allies there was a plan to let him do just that.</p><p>“I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had,” he told reporters on board Air Force One as he flew to South Korea where he is attending a regional summit as part of a whirlwind tour of Asia.</p><p>“And, you know, based on what I read, I guess I’m not allowed to run so we’ll see what happens,” he said.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday told reporters he had spoken with Trump about the possibility of president seeking a third-term but he sees no path for it as any change to the US Constitution would be well after Trump has left office.</p><p>“It’s been a great run.

{"details":"<p>The US is withdrawing some troops from Romania, on NATO’s eastern flank, as the Pentagon works to shift its focus away from Europe and toward homeland defense and Latin America, US and European officials said on Wednesday.</p><p>The US is sending home the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division back to Kentucky and will not be replacing the unit after its scheduled rotation out of Eastern Europe, according to US Army Europe and Africa. The redeployment comes as eastern flank NATO countries have faced a spike in threats from Russia in recent weeks, including multiple drone incursions in Polish airspace and repeated violations of Lithuanian airspace.</p><p>The Army said the reduction in troops is part of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s “deliberate process to ensure a balanced U.S.military force posture.”</p><p>“This is not an American withdrawal from Europe or a signal of lessened commitment to NATO and Article 5,” the Army press release said. “Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility. Our NATO allies are meeting President Trump’s call to take primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe. This force posture adjustment will not change the security environment in Europe.”</p><p>Romania’s Ministry of Defense said in a separate statement that it had “been informed about the withdrawal of some of the American troops deployed on NATO’s Eastern Flank, as part of the process of reassessing the global posture of US military forces.” The ministry added that “approximately one thousand American soldiers will remain deployed on our national territory.”</p><p>“The downsizing of the U.S. forces is an effect of the new priorities of the presidential administration,” the Romanian defense statement said.</p><p>The US troops will be pulled from Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base on the Black Sea, just across from Crimea which remains under de facto Russian control.</p><p>The withdrawal of some troops sparked rare GOP backlash to Pentagon decision making, with Republican Sen. Roger Wicker and Republican Rep.Mike Rogers saying in a joint statement that the move “sends the wrong signal to Russia at the very moment President Trump is applying pressure to force Vladimir Putin to come to the table to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine.”</p><p>Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed Services committee, said they “strongly oppose,” the decision and called it “concerning that Congress was not consulted in advance of this decision.”</p><p>“We are seeking clarification from the Pentagon on how it plans to mitigate the impact of this decision on NATO’s deterrence and defense posture and whether they coordinated with Allies to minimize these consequences,” they added.</p><p>The US still has more troops deployed in Europe than it did before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, NATO officials told CNN. But NATO defense planners are watching closely to see whether the US moves to further downsize its presence there, since that would likely require that NATO reconsider how allied troops are deployed across the continent, one of the officials said.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>The daughter of French first lady Brigitte Macron told a Paris court on Tuesday that her mother now suffers from “deep anxiety” because of false claims about her gender.</p><p>Tiphaine Auzière, 41, said it was important for her to testify at the trial, at which ten people are accused of online harassment of the 72-year-old first lady for spreading what prosecutors described as “malicious comments” about her gender and sexuality.</p><p>“There isn’t a single week when she isn’t harassed, not one person in her personal or professional life fails to bring up these allegations,” Auzière said.</p><p>She described how her mother is constantly having to pay attention to what she wears or how she carries herself for fear that any image of her may be “distorted” and weaponized online. The cyberbullying has taken a toll on Brigitte Macron’s mental health, Auzière said, adding that this “deterioration” is supported by medical assessments.</p><p>“She reads the tweets that are shown to her, but she no longer wants to,” Auzière added.</p><p>The youngest of Brigitte Macron’s three children, from her first marriage to André-Louis Auzière, said the attacks have also deeply affected the rest of the family. Her mother is devastated that “her grandchildren hear what is being said,” and “doesn’t know how to make it stop,” she explained.</p><p>The case relates to a legal complaint filed by the first lady’s lawyer in August 2024 alleging cyberbullying, which led to two waves of arrests in February and March of 2025.</p><p>Initial investigations identified several claims about Brigitte Macron’s gender and sexuality, as well as describing the age difference between her and the president as “pedophilia,” the prosecutor said. The trial is expected to last two days, and a verdict is likely to be issued later.</p><p>Among the eight men and two women on trial are an elected official, a gallery owner, an IT specialist, a teacher, a property manager and a business owner. All are aged between 41 and 60. CNN affiliate BFMTV provided details on one of the defendants: 41-year-old advertising executive Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, who uses the pseudonym “Zoé Sagan” on social media. His X account, which has since been suspended, has been the subject of several complaints and is often linked to conspiracy theorists.</p><p>If convicted, the defendants face up to two years in prison.</p><p>The trial comes three months after Macron and his wife filed a 22-count defamation lawsuit in the US state of Delaware against right-wing podcaster Candace Owens over the claim that Brigitte Macron could be a man.</p><p>The Delaware lawsuit alleges Owens broadcast “a relentless year-long campaign of defamation against the Macrons.”</p><p>In March, the conservative commentator revived a conspiracy theory in a YouTube video entitled “Is France’s First Lady a Man?” according to the complaint. Promoted widely on X, Owens said the conspiracy theory was “likely the biggest scandal in political history.”</p><p>Since then, Owens has produced numerous videos about Brigitte Macron for her nearly 4.5 million YouTube subscribers, including a multi-part series called “Becoming Brigitte.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Sudanese rebels have driven government forces from El Fasher, the last stronghold of the country’s regime in the western Darfur region, amid a brutal struggle for territory that has led to alleged genocide and contributed to one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.</p><p>For more than a year, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has besieged El Fasher, its final major barrier to controlling Darfur. The RSF aims to establish a parallel government in the region. It has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for power since April 2023.</p><p>Estimates suggest that more than 150,000 people have died due to the conflict, while an additional 14 million have been displaced from their homes.</p><p>Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also the de facto head of state, acknowledged the rebels’ capture of El Fasher. In a broadcast on Monday, he stated that his troops retreated from the city due to the destruction and systematic killing of civilians.</p><p>Justin Lynch, a Sudan researcher and managing director of Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and conflict monitoring organization, told CNN that the RSF’s capture of El Fasher marks “the beginning of what we fear to be a massacre of civilians.”</p><p>According to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations humanitarian chief, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in El Fasher, lacking food and health care. He reported that escape routes have been blocked amid “intense shelling and ground assaults” that “have engulfed the city.”</p><p>The RSF has claimed it is committed to protecting civilians in El Fasher and providing safe corridors for those seeking to leave.</p><p>However, the UN Human Rights Office said it had received “multiple, alarming reports” of the RSF committing atrocities including summary executions of civilians, and videos showing dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead surrounded by RSF fighters.</p><p>It also cited “indications of ethnic motivations for killings.”</p><p>At least 60 killed in attack on Sudan’s Al-Fashir, activists say</p><p>According to Jalale Getachew Birru, a senior analyst at the crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there is a “high risk of ethnically targeted attacks, particularly against non-Arab groups.”</p><p>Between April 2023 and mid-October 2025, her organization documented 390 incidents of violence against civilians in El Fasher and surrounding areas, resulting in over 1,300 reported fatalities, along with 180 attacks on internally displaced persons (IDPs) that caused at least 830 deaths.</p><p>Ethnically motivated killings have been a feature of the conflict from its outset, particularly in Darfur. The region experienced some of its worst ethnic violence in 2023, with hundreds of individuals from non-Arab ethnic groups massacred by the RSF and forces linked to it.</p><p>For the past 30 months, army leader al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who heads the RSF, have been fighting over control of Sudan.</p><p>These two men, once allies and among the most powerful generals in the country, jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from power in 2019.</p><p>They also played significant roles in a subsequent coup in 2021 when al-Burhan seized control from Sudan’s transitional government.</p><p>Genocide is declared once more in Sudan. How did the country get here?</p><p>Both generals have faced Western sanctions due to their involvement in war crimes. However, Dagalo’s RSF, along with its allied Arab militias, has been accused by the United States of committing genocide during the ongoing civil war. This marks the second time in two decades that the US has declared genocide in Sudan.</p><p>The US government said when making the declaration in January that the RSF had executed “direct attacks against civilians,” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”</p><p>Furthermore, it said, they had “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” and “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”</p><p>Sudan’s military government has accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying weapons to the RSF, although the UAE has denied this.</p><p>The RSF is a paramilitary group with an estimated 100,000 fighters, approximately half the size of the SAF.</p><p>The RSF has a history tied to ethnically-driven violence.</p><p>The group emerged from the Arab Janjaweed militia, which was responsible for the genocide in Darfur during the early 2000s. That resulted in an estimated 300,000 deaths.</p><p>The recent killings in El Fasher and other areas of Darfur reflect a pattern of targeted violence similar to that seen during the earlier genocide.</p><p>According to Lynch, the RSF’s takeover of El Fasher will “only mean more misery for civilians.”</p><p>The RSF’s seizure of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, represents a significant turning point that allows the group to strengthen its hold on the broader Darfur region, according to Birru.</p><p>It comes in the wake of the SAF regaining control of the country’s capital, Khartoum, from the RSF earlier this year.</p><p>Fighting is now expected to shift to the central and oil-rich Kordofan region, which borders Darfur, according to Birru.</p><p>The RSF announced on Saturday it had taken Bara, a crucial transport hub in North Kordofan state that connects the strategic town to the rest of the country.</p><p>“In Kordofan, the SAF and its allies are seeking to secure key routes connecting central Sudan to the Darfur region, while the RSF is working to consolidate control across both regions to rein in its alternative government in western Sudan,” Birru said.</p><p>“The outcome of battles in El Fasher and Kordofan will likely determine the future trajectory of Sudan’s conflict and the country’s political future,” she added, amid a global push for a ceasefire.</p><p>International human rights lawyer Yonah Diamond told CNN that the international community must intervene as violence escalates in Sudan and civilian casualties increase in El Fasher, asking whether world leaders would allow the RSF “to commit another genocide in Darfur with impunity.”</p><p>“The time for emergency action is right now – to end the bloodshed, open humanitarian corridors, and protect the people of El Fasher and what’s left of any global conscience,” he said.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.
