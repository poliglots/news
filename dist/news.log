The BBC has not independently verified its contents, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has denied any knowledge of its existence.</p><p>Let's take a look at some of the key differences between the two reported plans.</p><p>Europe's reported counter-proposal includes:</p><p>Here are some points from the initial reported US proposal, for comparison:</p><p>German government spokesperson Sebastian Hille has praised \"progress\" made in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine over the weekend.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Berlin, he says Germany sees it \"very positively that there is finally progress again\" and welcomes things \"moving forward\".</p><p>This follows comments made by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said earlier that he had stressed to US President Donald Trump the negative consequences for Europe if Ukraine were to collapse following defeat in the war.</p><p>Steve RosenbergRussia editor, in Moscow</p><p>President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that officially the Kremlin has not received any information on the results of the Geneva talks.</p><p>Asked by the BBC whether he expects Russian and American officials to meet this week, Peskov replies “not yet” – though Moscow, he says, is “open to such contacts and talks”.</p><p>Last week Vladimir Putin announced that the Trump administration’s 28-point draft peace plan could form the basis for a final settlement. That proposal was widely seen as favouring Russia. The Kremlin will want to know what changes have been made to the draft in Geneva.</p><p>The suspicion here in Moscow is that the updated version will not be as favourable to Russia. This morning the Russian tabloid Mosovsky Komsomolets wrote: “The European and Ukrainian gang will 'correct' Trump’s plan in such a way that it becomes completely unacceptable for Russia.”</p><p>Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov says Ukrainians would \"fight to the end\" to save the Donbas territories from coming under Russian control.</p><p>As we've been reporting, Donald Trump's 28-point plan says Kyiv's troops must withdraw from parts of the Donetsk region they currently control, which would then be recognised internationally as under Russian control.</p><p>Chernov tells the BBC's Global Story podcast: \"We should ask Ukrainians what they think about it.\"</p><p>He describes the regions under discussion in peace talks as \"places of my childhood\".</p><p>\"Maybe for the sake of saving lives there will be some sort of agreement, but I know the bitterness of that.\"</p><p>\"It's burnt and it's my home,\" he adds. \"Ukraine is not only the land, Ukraine is a community or community of communities. So as long as that idea survives, Ukraine will survive.\"</p><p>Chernov won an Academy Award in 2024 for his documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, which documented the Russian siege of the city at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Here are some pictures of the aftermath in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, where four people have died after Russian attacks.</p><p>\"Every night and every day are new challenges for our city, new destruction and new work for all services that have been continuously saving people,\" the city's Mayor Ihor Terekhov writes following the strikes.</p><p>We've just heard from US President Donald Trump about the weekend's peace talks in Geneva.</p><p>\"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he writes in a social media post.</p><p>Laura GozziEurope reporter</p><p>Earlier today, Zelensky said a major issue was that Putin wanted \"legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty\" - a reference to Russia's repeated demand that Ukrainian troops withdraw from several embattled eastern regions.</p><p>With this, Zelensky is making the point that allowing Russia to seize land by force would set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>International law recognises Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its occupation of several other regions directly challenged this principle - and the idea that a peace settlement could reward Moscow for its aggression is unacceptable, Zelensky says.</p><p>The US peace plan draft proposes to freeze the front line in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, giving Moscow control of huge areas of those regions. Perhaps more concerningly for Ukraine, it also says Kyiv should hand over the areas of the industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Russia.</p><p>Zelensky has repeatedly said that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future - not to mention the thousands of casualties Ukraine has suffered, and is still suffering, trying to protect the region.</p><p>It would be very difficult for Zelensky to justify the loss of the Donbas to Ukrainians.</p><p>Following Volodymyr Zelensky's address to Sweden, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says Ukraine will not accept legal recognition of the Russian-occupied territories, restrictions on Ukraine's forces, or limits on Ukraine's future alliances.</p><p>Ruslan Stefanchuk describes these as rules that \"no-one can violate\" in the peace negotiations.</p><p>He also tells the Swedish parliament that Ukraine's membership of the EU and Nato must be part of any peace plan.</p><p>As we've reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been addressing the Swedish parliament.</p><p>He says the \"main problem\" facing the peace talks is Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory he has \"stolen\" from Ukraine.</p><p>\"This would break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he tells the lawmakers, and insists that \"borders cannot be changed by force\".</p><p>\"Keep pressure on Russia. Russia is still killing people,\" he finishes by saying.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses the Swedish parliament after talks in Geneva</p><p>Nick BeakeEurope correspondent</p><p>US (left) and Ukrainian delegations met in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday</p><p>European countries have been struggling to project a persuasive voice in what is a US-led process.</p><p>EU leaders are currently meeting African leaders in Angola, which may well reinforce the sense of them being far removed from the negotiations.</p><p>President Macron of France warned over the weekend that Russia could invade Ukraine again if the Zelensky government is pushed into reducing the size of its military.</p><p>Chancellor Merz of Germany said he had stressed to President Trump in a phone call the severe consequences for the whole of Europe if Ukraine were to collapse following defeat in the war.</p><p>But it is hard to tell if these words are having any impact.</p><p>Ukraine is certainly hoping the personal relationships of certain European leaders with Trump will benefit them in a process that appears to have favoured Russia from the outset.</p><p>Trump-whisperer and golf partner President Stubb of Finland has tweeted this morning about “major issues” needing to be resolved, and said he had been in touch with Zelensky.</p><p>But he also had a message to the US and to the man with whom he has often strode down the fairway together – that EU and Nato members would take “a separate track” to discuss matters affecting them directly.</p><p>In other words, America and Russia would not dictate their future.</p><p>The Kremlin says it hasn't received an updated peace plan following the weekend's talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva.</p><p>Speaking this morning, Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov says Vladimir Putin's administration has been following the discussions and understands that \"some adjustments\" have been made to the peace plans Russia had previously received.</p><p>But he adds: \"So far, we have not received anything officially.\"</p><p>Peskov also says there are no plans for Russian talks with a US delegation about Ukraine this week.</p><p>Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent in Geneva</p><p>We understand that the talks in Geneva are over after an intense day of diplomacy on Sunday, with all the key negotiators leaving town.</p><p>Marco Rubio left last night and the Ukrainian delegation has also returned to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian state media who were covering the talks. The UK security adviser Jonathan Powell has now gone, diplomats here say.</p><p>Yesterday, Marco Rubio made clear that the push for a peace proposal - a \"living, breathing document\" as he called it - was a process that had been in the works for three weeks prior to the high level talks, and would continue away from Geneva.</p><p>“We have all kinds of people on technical levels working full time on this,” Rubio told the press before flying out of Switzerland last night. “There are a handful of technical items that we expect answers from on or suggestions in the next 24 hours or so. So this is an ongoing process.”</p><p>The US idea was to get the big names round the same table on Sunday to try to “iron out” some issues and the US secretary of state said they had made “great strides”.</p><p>Those involved will now report back to their respective presidents.</p><p>What are media outlets in Russia saying about Donald Trump's latest push to end the war in Ukraine?</p><p>The BBC's Russia editor Steve Roseberg has been looking through the morning papers to find out.</p><p>He notes there's significant scepticism that this round of diplomacy will bring results - and there's also a lot of finger pointing at Kyiv and Europe.</p><p>A former MI6 chief has praised this weekend’s peace talks as a “good approach”, but says the initial proposals were just Moscow talking points.</p><p>Alex Younger, who led MI6 from 2014 to 2020, tells the BBC that the original proposals - which asked Kyiv to cut its military by the thousands and commit to not joining Nato - would have left Ukraine “a tethered goat” after Russia created a weakness it would later exploit.</p><p>If Ukraine had agreed to this straight away, Younger tells the Today programme, “the war would restart”.</p><p>He says the idea that Ukraine’s army should be so limited it can’t defend itself is an “absolute non-starter”.</p><p>Instead, Younger says the only security guarantee that matters is Ukraine having a powerful, well-equipped army able to defend itself - the “porcupine strategy”.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just addressed the Swedish parliament via video link.</p><p>He says this is \"a critical moment\", and Ukraine is working \"closely with the US and other European partners to define steps\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty. That's the main problem. You all understand what that means,\" he says.</p><p>Putin wants this \"not only from Ukraine, he wants it from the whole world, and it's very dangerous.\"</p><p>Zelensky adds that during the talks so far, they've managed to keep \"very sensitive points\" on the table, including the release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children.</p><p>But he says there's more to do, and calls for decisions on the use of frozen Russian assets.</p><p>\"The aggressor must pay fully for the war he started,\" Zelensky tells the parliament.</p><p>Hungary's foreign minister Péter Szijjártó urges European leaders to support the 28-point plan, which he says is a \"major chance\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Every European politician has a duty to support this plan fully and unconditionally, as this is the rational and humane choice,\" he says.</p><p>He criticises any Western European leader trying to \"block\" the plan.</p><p>Hungary has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has used Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to maintain good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform to win re-election next April in Hungary by promising \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.</p><p>Alexander Stubb visited Donald Trump at the White House in October</p><p>Finland's president Alexander Stubb says he welcomes the progress made in the talks in Geneva, after speaking to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>\"The negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\" he adds.</p><p>Stubb adds any decision falling within the remit of the EU or Nato will be discussed and decided by their members separately.</p><p>Copyright © 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The meeting in Cairo comes as Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the dozens of people killed in Israel’s latest attacks.</p><p>Funerals held across Gaza for Palestinians killed by Israel in another ceasefire breach</p><p>By Al Jazeera Staff and News Agencies</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>A senior delegation from Hamas has met Egypt’s intelligence chief in Cairo to discuss Israel’s breaches of the ceasefire agreement, the group said, as Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for dozens of people killed in recent Israeli attacks.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday, the group said it reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in its meeting with Hassan Rashad, but accused Israel of “continued violations” that it said threatened to “undermine the deal”.</p><p>Hamas, whose delegation included its exiled Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya, called for a “clear and defined mechanism” under the supervision of mediators to document and halt any breaches of the deal.</p><p>Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been mediating between Hamas and Israel, securing the ceasefire that came into effect last month.</p><p>The Palestinian group said it also discussed with Egypt ways to urgently resolve the issue of Hamas fighters holed up in tunnel networks in Rafah in Israeli-controlled areas of Gaza.</p><p>It said communication with the fighters has been severed.</p><p>The meeting came a day after Israeli forces launched a wave of air attacks across Gaza, destroying homes, makeshift shelters and a car, killing at least 24 Palestinians, including children.</p><p>The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas members after the group sent a fighter into Israeli-controlled Gaza territory to attack Israeli soldiers there. The military said a local Hamas commander was among those killed in the Saturday strikes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hamas has rejected the allegations, saying Israel was looking for an excuse to kill. The group on Saturday called on the mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the US – to intervene urgently and exert pressure on Israel to “immediately halt these violations”.</p><p>According to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israel has violated the ceasefire at least 497 times since it came into effect on October 10.</p><p>Some 342 civilians have been killed in the attacks, with children, women and the elderly accounting for the majority of the victims, it said.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians there fear an expansion of Israel’s attacks.</p><p>“It’s very hard to tell that there’s a letup in terms of Israel’s attacks on Gaza. We are seeing continuous attacks beyond the ‘yellow line’, which are the areas under Israeli control. We are seeing demolition and systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and landmarks, and the turning of this area into a barren landscape,” Abu Azzoum said.</p><p>“People here are concerned about the potential expansion of Israel’s attacks to other areas in Gaza in the coming days. People are also sceptical of the possibility of moving from phase one of the ceasefire to phase two as they are still waiting to see if the deal can be sustained and if there will be advancements in terms of the flow of humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts,” he added.</p><p>Phase one of the ceasefire – based on US President Donald Trump’s peace plan – involves the exchange of captives and prisoners, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the opening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.</p><p>So far, Hamas has released all remaining living captives and returned dozens of bodies, except for three. Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians, including prisoners serving life sentences. But it has placed restrictions on border crossings that continue to impede the delivery of aid, according to humanitarian groups.</p><p>Israel has also refused to allow the Rafah crossing to open.</p><p>Phase two of the ceasefire meanwhile calls for Gaza to be governed under a technocratic Palestinian committee, with oversight and supervision of the Trump-led “board of peace”. The board is to also deploy a temporary International Stabilisation Force to secure border areas, train Palestinian police and also demilitarise Gaza.</p><p>Hamas, however, says it will not lay down weapons as long as the Israeli occupation continues.</p><p>Tump’s plan also says no Palestinian would be forced to leave Gaza and that “Israel will not occupy or annex” the territory.</p><p>The plan has now been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Hamas meet Egypt’s spy chief, says Israel’s attacks on Gaza threaten truce","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/hamas-meet-egypts-spy-chief-says-israels-attacks-on-gaza-threaten-truce","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T18:30:00.000Z"}
{"details":"<p>Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.</p><p>The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.</p><p>Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\".</p><p>Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".</p><p>But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".</p><p>This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.</p><p>The US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia.</p><p>Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.</p><p>\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"</p><p>Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.</p><p>Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.</p><p>Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it.</p><p>Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\".</p><p>\"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.</p><p>The US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.</p><p>Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.</p><p>Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.</p><p>Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".</p><p>Ukraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.</p><p>The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.</p><p>But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\".</p><p>\"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"</p><p>But staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"</p><p>However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.</p><p>The US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p>But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p>It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake.

Others require higher-level decisions and consultations. Others, I think, just need more time to work through.”</p><p>The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the US to end the nearly four-year Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine has sparked alarm in Kyiv and European capitals.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the US support it so desperately relies on. Zelenskyy also asserted that Ukrainians “will always defend” their home.</p><p>The proposal accommodates many Russian demands that Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including ceding large territories.</p><p>In a statement released on Sunday night after the talks, the White House said the Ukrainian delegation “affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting.”</p><p>It added that Kyiv “expressed appreciation for the structured approach taken to incorporate their feedback into each component of the emerging settlement framework.” The White House said changes made to the proposal now reflect “their national interests\" and provide \"credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term.”</p><p></p><p>But the language of such positive steps came only after concerns about the original, Trump-endorsed deal intensified.</p><p>A bipartisan group of US senators said Rubio told them Saturday that the plan had originated with Russia and was actually a “wish list” for Moscow, rather than a serious push for peace.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he’d spoken to Trump and made clear there were some parts of the plans key European nations could agree on, but others where they could not.</p><p>“I told him that we are fully in line with Ukraine, that the sovereignty of this country must not be jeopardised,” Merz said in an interview with a German media outlet.</p><p>Rubio called the US proposal a “living breathing document” that would continue changing. He also made clear that any final product, once it’s ready, will still have to be presented to Moscow; “obviously, the Russians get a vote here.”</p><p></p><p>The positive assessment of what was discussed defied Trump himself. Before talks began, the president blasted Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for US military assistance while shying away from criticising Russia.</p><p>“Ukraine 'leadership' has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts, and Europe cotinues to by oil from Russia,” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, on Sunday morning.</p><p>After Trump’s post, Zelenskyy cheered US-led efforts on security while also stressing that “the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.”</p><p>“Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on Telegram, adding, “We thank everyone in Europe.”</p><p>“It is important not to forget the main goal – to stop Russia’s war and prevent it from ever igniting again,” he added.</p><p>Additional sources • AP</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"US and Ukraine make progress in Geneva talks to end Russia's invasion","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/24/us-and-ukrainian-delegations-report-progress-on-ending-russian-invasion-after-talks-in-gen","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T04:10:36.000Z"}

The military said a local Hamas commander was among those killed in the Saturday strikes.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hamas has rejected the allegations, saying Israel was looking for an excuse to kill. The group on Saturday called on the mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the US – to intervene urgently and exert pressure on Israel to “immediately halt these violations”.</p><p>According to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israel has violated the ceasefire at least 497 times since it came into effect on October 10.</p><p>Some 342 civilians have been killed in the attacks, with children, women and the elderly accounting for the majority of the victims, it said.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians there fear an expansion of Israel’s attacks.</p><p>“It’s very hard to tell that there’s a letup in terms of Israel’s attacks on Gaza. We are seeing continuous attacks beyond the ‘yellow line’, which are the areas under Israeli control. We are seeing demolition and systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and landmarks, and the turning of this area into a barren landscape,” Abu Azzoum said.</p><p>“People here are concerned about the potential expansion of Israel’s attacks to other areas in Gaza in the coming days. People are also sceptical of the possibility of moving from phase one of the ceasefire to phase two as they are still waiting to see if the deal can be sustained and if there will be advancements in terms of the flow of humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts,” he added.</p><p>Phase one of the ceasefire – based on US President Donald Trump’s peace plan – involves the exchange of captives and prisoners, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the opening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.</p><p>So far, Hamas has released all remaining living captives and returned dozens of bodies, except for three. Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians, including prisoners serving life sentences. But it has placed restrictions on border crossings that continue to impede the delivery of aid, according to humanitarian groups.</p><p>Israel has also refused to allow the Rafah crossing to open.</p><p>Phase two of the ceasefire meanwhile calls for Gaza to be governed under a technocratic Palestinian committee, with oversight and supervision of the Trump-led “board of peace”. The board is to also deploy a temporary International Stabilisation Force to secure border areas, train Palestinian police and also demilitarise Gaza.</p><p>Hamas, however, says it will not lay down weapons as long as the Israeli occupation continues.</p><p>Tump’s plan also says no Palestinian would be forced to leave Gaza and that “Israel will not occupy or annex” the territory.</p><p>The plan has now been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Hamas meet Egypt’s spy chief, says Israel’s attacks on Gaza threaten truce","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/hamas-meet-egypts-spy-chief-says-israels-attacks-on-gaza-threaten-truce","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T18:30:00.000Z"}

That proposal was widely seen as favouring Russia. The Kremlin will want to know what changes have been made to the draft in Geneva.</p><p>The suspicion here in Moscow is that the updated version will not be as favourable to Russia. This morning the Russian tabloid Mosovsky Komsomolets wrote: “The European and Ukrainian gang will 'correct' Trump’s plan in such a way that it becomes completely unacceptable for Russia.”</p><p>Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov says Ukrainians would \"fight to the end\" to save the Donbas territories from coming under Russian control.</p><p>As we've been reporting, Donald Trump's 28-point plan says Kyiv's troops must withdraw from parts of the Donetsk region they currently control, which would then be recognised internationally as under Russian control.</p><p>Chernov tells the BBC's Global Story podcast: \"We should ask Ukrainians what they think about it.\"</p><p>He describes the regions under discussion in peace talks as \"places of my childhood\".</p><p>\"Maybe for the sake of saving lives there will be some sort of agreement, but I know the bitterness of that.\"</p><p>\"It's burnt and it's my home,\" he adds. \"Ukraine is not only the land, Ukraine is a community or community of communities.

Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he writes in a social media post.</p><p>Laura GozziEurope reporter</p><p>Earlier today, Zelensky said a major issue was that Putin wanted \"legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty\" - a reference to Russia's repeated demand that Ukrainian troops withdraw from several embattled eastern regions.</p><p>With this, Zelensky is making the point that allowing Russia to seize land by force would set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>International law recognises Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its occupation of several other regions directly challenged this principle - and the idea that a peace settlement could reward Moscow for its aggression is unacceptable, Zelensky says.</p><p>The US peace plan draft proposes to freeze the front line in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, giving Moscow control of huge areas of those regions. Perhaps more concerningly for Ukraine, it also says Kyiv should hand over the areas of the industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Russia.</p><p>Zelensky has repeatedly said that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future - not to mention the thousands of casualties Ukraine has suffered, and is still suffering, trying to protect the region.</p><p>It would be very difficult for Zelensky to justify the loss of the Donbas to Ukrainians.</p><p>Following Volodymyr Zelensky's address to Sweden, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says Ukraine will not accept legal recognition of the Russian-occupied territories, restrictions on Ukraine's forces, or limits on Ukraine's future alliances.</p><p>Ruslan Stefanchuk describes these as rules that \"no-one can violate\" in the peace negotiations.</p><p>He also tells the Swedish parliament that Ukraine's membership of the EU and Nato must be part of any peace plan.</p><p>As we've reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been addressing the Swedish parliament.</p><p>He says the \"main problem\" facing the peace talks is Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory he has \"stolen\" from Ukraine.</p><p>\"This would break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he tells the lawmakers, and insists that \"borders cannot be changed by force\".</p><p>\"Keep pressure on Russia.

So this is an ongoing process.”</p><p>The US idea was to get the big names round the same table on Sunday to try to “iron out” some issues and the US secretary of state said they had made “great strides”.</p><p>Those involved will now report back to their respective presidents.</p><p>What are media outlets in Russia saying about Donald Trump's latest push to end the war in Ukraine?</p><p>The BBC's Russia editor Steve Roseberg has been looking through the morning papers to find out.</p><p>He notes there's significant scepticism that this round of diplomacy will bring results - and there's also a lot of finger pointing at Kyiv and Europe.</p><p>A former MI6 chief has praised this weekend’s peace talks as a “good approach”, but says the initial proposals were just Moscow talking points.</p><p>Alex Younger, who led MI6 from 2014 to 2020, tells the BBC that the original proposals - which asked Kyiv to cut its military by the thousands and commit to not joining Nato - would have left Ukraine “a tethered goat” after Russia created a weakness it would later exploit.</p><p>If Ukraine had agreed to this straight away, Younger tells the Today programme, “the war would restart”.</p><p>He says the idea that Ukraine’s army should be so limited it can’t defend itself is an “absolute non-starter”.</p><p>Instead, Younger says the only security guarantee that matters is Ukraine having a powerful, well-equipped army able to defend itself - the “porcupine strategy”.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just addressed the Swedish parliament via video link.</p><p>He says this is \"a critical moment\", and Ukraine is working \"closely with the US and other European partners to define steps\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty. That's the main problem. You all understand what that means,\" he says.</p><p>Putin wants this \"not only from Ukraine, he wants it from the whole world, and it's very dangerous.\"</p><p>Zelensky adds that during the talks so far, they've managed to keep \"very sensitive points\" on the table, including the release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children.</p><p>But he says there's more to do, and calls for decisions on the use of frozen Russian assets.</p><p>\"The aggressor must pay fully for the war he started,\" Zelensky tells the parliament.</p><p>Hungary's foreign minister Péter Szijjártó urges European leaders to support the 28-point plan, which he says is a \"major chance\" to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>\"Every European politician has a duty to support this plan fully and unconditionally, as this is the rational and humane choice,\" he says.</p><p>He criticises any Western European leader trying to \"block\" the plan.</p><p>Hungary has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>The European Commission is planning to boost the use of biofuels to cut emissions in heavy industry transport as part of its revamp of the upcoming bioeconomy strategy, according to a leaked document seen by Euronews.</p><p>Aviation and maritime remain the 'Achilles heel' of decarbonisation under the EU27's energy and climate transition goals. The sectors remain highly reliant on fossil fuels and account for around 8.4% of the EU's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to EU data.</p><p>Despite ongoing EU investments to develop clean power, sustainable fuels for heavy transport aren't available on scale. The EU executive is proposing to boost the use of crops and trees for biofuel production in a bid to slash GHG emissions.</p><p>\"Demand is expected to rise from 2025\", mainly driven by ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime,\" reads the document, referring to the bloc's laws designed to increase the uptake of renewable fuels in heavy transport.</p><p>Environmental groups have long criticised the use of biofuels as unsustainable, arguing that it could jeopardise food security and the ability of forests to trap CO2 from the atmosphere.</p><p>Biofuels are categorised by source, with each category known as a “generation.”</p><p>First-generation biofuels are derived from food crops like corn and sugarcane, second-generation biofuels are derived from inedible vegetation and agricultural waste, and third-generation biofuels are derived from algae.</p><p>However, the block is far from having the capacity to produce enough biofuels.</p><p>A 2023 audit from the European Court of Auditors found that sustainability issues, biomass availability and costs are limiting the deployment of biofuels. It also noted that the lack of a long-term perspective in EU biofuels policy has affected investment.</p><p>According to a recent report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), Europe’s resource use of nature-based materials exceeds the domestic capacity of ecosystems to regenerate green resources and absorb CO2.</p><p>In 2022, biomass use for energy in Europe accounted for 29%, the leaked document stated, noting that this figure has increased by 14% over the past 10 years.</p><p>A recent trade deal on agriculture signed between the EU and Ukraine could fulfil the bloc's demand for biofuels.</p><p>Kyiv's vast agricultural land size of 41.3 million hectares — 68.5% of Ukraine's total land — of which 32.7 million hectares were arable land, according to 2024 research from the European Parliament.</p><p>The new deal includes safeguards limiting imports of certain sensitive products such as grains and oil. If these are lifted, Ukraine could end up playing a key role in the supply chain.</p><p>The Commission will announce on Tuesday the third review of the bioeconomy since its launch in 2012. It is meant to support goals like food security, climate action and competitiveness.</p><p>The sector has generated up to €2.7 trillion in 2023, according to the document, up from the €812 billion in 2022.</p><p>\"The EU’s bioeconomy is a dynamic driver for competitiveness and is of strategic importance,\" read the document.</p><p>However, international competition, notably from the United States and China, and persistent barriers in the single market are slowing deployment and risk diverting innovation to non-EU markets, according to the document.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"EU executive touts increase of biofuels uptake for aviation, maritime","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/24/exclusive-european-commission-touts-increase-of-biofuels-to-clean-up-heavy-transport","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T11:10:54.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.</p><p>The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.</p><p>Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\".</p><p>Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".</p><p>But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".</p><p>This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.</p><p>The US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia.</p><p>Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.</p><p>\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"</p><p>Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.</p><p>Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.</p><p>Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it.</p><p>Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\".</p><p>\"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.</p><p>The US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.</p><p>Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.</p><p>Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.</p><p>Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".</p><p>Ukraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.</p><p>The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.</p><p>But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\".</p><p>\"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"</p><p>But staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"</p><p>However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.</p><p>The US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p>But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p>It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p>Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p>The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>A submarine expert says he is \"confident\" the recovered object is an imploded Russian sonobuoy.</p><p>Aishat Baimuradova fled her home this year in the hope of living the way she wanted, but she was then found dead in her rented flat.</p><p>US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.</p><p>\"I didn't get the life I wanted... I was forced to move to a different country,\" says Kvitka, 14.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>Across Europe, space agencies are expanding their strategies to blend science with security.</p><p>Countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are investing in space satellites, defence, and launch capabilities to protect assets, boost competitiveness, and respond to emerging threats in orbit.</p><p>The emphasis on defence comes amid GPS jamming threats, new kinetic missiles, and dependence on foreign launch systems threaten to limit Europe’s space access. What are different European countries prioritising in space?</p><p>Germany unveiled its first national strategy for the future of space, with a focus on security.</p><p>The new plan, unveiled in November, covers spaceflight projects, the expansion of satellite networks and international collaborations so the country can become “more capable of action” in space, a government statement reads.</p><p></p><p>“Space systems have become an integral part of our lives … their failure or disruption would have serious consequences for our security and everyday lives,” defence minister Boris Pistorius said in a statement.</p><p>It also earmarks €35 billion in new investments for the space sector “in the coming years,” to defend Germans from incidents such as GPS signal disruptions by Russia in the Baltic Sea region.</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron announced in November that France’s new space strategy will marry scientific research and security.</p><p>The French plan has five main goals: maintaining competitive access to space, building a space economy, retaining a space military architecture, investing in research, and fostering international cooperation.</p><p>Among the goals listed in the plan is to modernise the space centre in French Guiana, where the Ariane 6 launcher will eventually pilot commercial flights.</p><p>The plan includes an additional €4.2 billion investment into space defence,bringing the total investment to over €10 billion by 2030.</p><p></p><p>Macron said that the plan matches competition in space, which is building in space, such as energy arms and lasers.</p><p>One of the weapons that France could invest in is patrol-seeking satellites called Orbit Guard and Toutatis that will be able to protect the country’s assets in orbit.</p><p>The plan will also strengthen military capabilities in intelligence, early warning systems and communications.</p><p>France will contribute more research in Earth sciences to help climate resilience efforts.</p><p>The recent plan builds on France’s Military Programming Act, which promised to build systems that could detect suspicious or aggressive acts in space.</p><p>The country has also launched Space Pact, a group to facilitate conversations between the military and space industry players. ​</p><p>In October, Italy’s budget earmarked €109 million for the launch of a space defence plan.</p><p>While it is currently being developed, the government said it will be a “multi-domain” plan that will help Italy respond to possible threats that could occur in the next two decades.</p><p>The plan will eventually identify “short-term capabilities [and] fill operational gaps,” in its defence.</p><p>The government allocated an additional €131 million for space surveillance or “space object monitoring,” to protect national space assets, keep an eye on space debris and maintain a “safe access” to space.</p><p></p><p>The budget also allocated €186 million for a Sicral 3 satellite, a high-frequency satellite that will improve secure communications between the Italian government and the military. The system was first developed in 2001 by Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space.</p><p>Thales received a €100 million contract from the Italian Space Agency to build a network of satellite factories across Italy that should be fully operational by 2026, according to local reporting.</p><p>Italy is also investing in a constellation of Earth observation satellites that will monitor environmental changes and support critical services in the country. The first launch for the future Iride constellation happened in January 2025.</p><p>The country is working with Germany and France on the development of several European launchers, including the Ariane 6 and its smaller sister, Vega-C.</p><p>The UK Space Agency’s plan, released in September, will use space to strengthen the country’s economy, increase security and continue to unlock “global discoveries that inspire millions”.</p><p>The country will invest in small-launch capabilities such as launch vehicles, eco-friendly spaceports and developing niches in satellite communications.</p><p></p><p>There is also a push from the UK to build the right capacities to repair, upgrade or assemble satellites while in orbit.</p><p>The UK’s Space Agency says it will achieve its plans by building inclusive workplaces that attract and keep talent, making more investments in science and innovation fields and through international partnerships.</p><p>The Nordic country launched its first defence and security space strategy in 2024.</p><p>The strategy is based on four pillars: autonomy in space, developing a “robust portfolio” of space assets to support national defence, collective security and developing the relevant knowledge for defence projects.</p><p>To do this, the strategy said the state will expand collaboration between government agencies, private companies in the space sector, and potentially adapt space legislation.</p><p></p><p>The government has also allocated SEK 1 billion (€914 million) to the Swedish Armed Forces for reconnaissance and surveillance.</p><p>The defence policy says that Sweden’s location near the North Pole makes it an ideal place to operate, monitor and launch polar satellites in particular.</p><p>Sweden’s strategy said it is building launch capabilities for the Esrange spaceport, a launch site in the north. Firefly Aerospace will launch satellites from the station next year, according to the Swedish Space Corporation.</p><p>Space is one of the key areas identified by the Netherlands in its Dutch Defence Strategyfor the end of the decade.</p><p>It sets out a series of space goals for the next four years. By 2027, the military will have a network of satellites that will provide it with reliable information.</p><p>By 2030, the Dutch want to use advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to track objects in space, record Earth observations and coordinate satellite communication.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the military is aiming to access a European early warning system to help with air and missile defence.</p><p>Defence policy in space dates back to 2022 in the Netherlands with the Defence Space Agenda.</p><p>The country said it would build up six capacities: space situational awareness (SSA), reconnaissance, satellite communications, positioning/navigation/timing, shared early warning, and monitoring space weather.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"How does each European country plan to win the space race?","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/11/24/the-new-space-race-these-are-the-different-space-strategies-across-europe","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T06:01:13.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>A three-year-old boy has astounded doctors with his progress after becoming the first person in the world with his devastating disease to receive a ground-breaking gene therapy.</p><p>Oliver Chu has a rare, inherited condition called Hunter syndrome - or MPSII - which causes progressive damage to the body and brain.</p><p>In the most severe cases, patients with the disease usually die before the age of 20. The effects are sometimes described as a type of childhood dementia.</p><p>Due to a faulty gene, before the treatment Oliver was unable to produce an enzyme crucial for keeping cells healthy.</p><p>In a world first, medical staff in Manchester have tried to halt the disease by altering Oliver's cells using gene therapy.</p><p>Prof Simon Jones, who is co-leading the trial tells the BBC: \"I've been waiting 20 years to see a boy like Ollie doing as well as he is, and it's just so exciting.\"</p><p>At the centre of this remarkable story is Oliver - the first of five boys around the world to receive the treatment - and the Chu family, from California, who have put their faith in the medical team at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</p><p>A year after starting the treatment, Oliver now appears to be developing normally.</p><p>\"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing,\" says his mother Jingru.</p><p>The BBC has followed Oliver's story for more than a year - including how scientists in the UK first developed the pioneering gene therapy and how the medical trial they are conducting almost didn't get off the ground due to lack of funds.</p><p>We first meet Oliver and his dad Ricky in December 2024 at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. It's a big day.</p><p>Since being diagnosed with Hunter syndrome in April,  Oliver's life - like that of his elder brother, Skyler, who also has the condition - has been dominated by hospital visits.</p><p>Skyler had shown some late development in speech and coordination, but this had initially been put down to being born during Covid.</p><p>Ricky tells me his sons' diagnosis came as a complete shock.</p><p>\"When you find out about Hunter syndrome, the first thing the doctor tells you is 'Don't go on the internet and look it up because you'll find the worst cases and you'll be very, very disheartened'.\"</p><p>\"But, like anybody, you look it up and you're like, 'Oh my goodness, is this what's going to happen to both my sons?'\"</p><p>Children are born apparently healthy, but around the age of two they start to show symptoms of the disease.</p><p>These vary and can include changes to physical features, stiffness of the limbs and short stature.  It can cause damage throughout the body, including to the heart, liver, bones and joints and in the most serious cases can lead to severe mental impairment and progressive neurological decline.</p><p>Hunter syndrome almost always occurs in boys. It's extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 male births in the world.</p><p>Until now, the only medicine available for Hunter syndrome was Elaprase, which costs around £300,000 per patient, per year and can slow the physical effects of the disease. The drug is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and so does not help with cognitive symptoms.</p><p>But today, Oliver is being hooked up to a machine and having some of his cells removed - the first crucial step in trying to halt his genetic disorder in this one-off treatment.</p><p>\"His blood is being passed through a fancy machine that is collecting a specific type of cell called stem cells which will be sent to a lab to be modified and then given back to him,\" Dr Claire Horgan, consultant paediatric haematologist explains.</p><p>Oliver's cells are carefully packaged and sent to a laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London.</p><p>In Hunter syndrome, a genetic error means that cells are missing the instructions for making an enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), essential for breaking down large sugar molecules which over time accumulate in tissues and organs.</p><p>Scientists insert the missing IDS gene into a virus, which has its genetic material removed so that it can't cause disease.</p><p>A similar method has been used in other gene therapies, such as the treatment for another rare inherited condition, MLD.</p><p>Dr Karen Buckland, from the Cell and Gene Therapy Service at GOSH, explains: \"We use the machinery from the virus to insert a working copy of the faulty gene into each of the stem cells.</p><p>\"When those go back to Oliver, they should repopulate his bone marrow and start to produce new white blood cells and each of these will hopefully start to produce the missing protein [enzyme] in his body.\"</p><p>There still remains the issue of how to get enough of the missing enzyme into the brain.</p><p>To overcome this, the inserted gene is modified so that the enzyme it produces crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently.</p><p>We next meet Oliver back at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</p><p>This time he's with his mum Jingru, while Ricky has stayed in California to look after Skyler.</p><p>There is a sense of anticipation as a member of the research team opens a large metal cryopreservation tank where Oliver's gene edited stem cells are frozen, having been transported back from GOSH.</p><p>A small, clear infusion bag is removed and slowly brought to body temperature in a tray of liquid.</p><p>After multiple checks, a nurse draws the clear fluid containing around 125 million gene-modified stem cells, into a syringe.</p><p>Oliver is used to hospitals, but is fretful, and wriggles as the research nurse slowly injects the treatment, about a cup full, into a catheter in his chest.</p><p>Jingru holds Oliver steady in her arms. After 10 minutes, the infusion is done.</p><p>An hour later, a second, identical infusion is made. Oliver continues to watch cartoons on a portable screen, oblivious to the potential importance of what's just happened.</p><p>And that's it. The gene therapy is complete. It seems to be all over rather quickly, yet the ambition here is huge: to stop Oliver's progressive disease in its tracks, in a one-off treatment.</p><p>After a couple of days, Oliver and Jingru fly back to California. Now the family, and the medical team must wait to see if the gene therapy has worked.</p><p>In May, Oliver is back in Manchester for crucial tests to see if the gene therapy is working. This time the whole family is here.</p><p>We meet in a park in central Manchester and it's immediately clear that things are looking good.</p><p>Oliver is more mobile and inquisitive than I've seen him. Admittedly, he now has the freedom to play and is out of hospital, but he appears brighter and healthier.</p><p>Ricky is thrilled: \"He's doing really well. We have seen him progressing in his speech, and mobility. In just three months he has matured.\"</p><p>The really big news is that Oliver has been able to come off the weekly infusion of the missing enzyme.</p><p>\"I want to pinch myself every time I tell people that Oliver is making his own enzymes,\" says Jingru. \"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing.\"</p><p>She tells me he is \"so different\" from before the treatment, is talking \"a ton\" and is engaging more with other children.</p><p>It is lovely to finally meet five-year-old Skyler who is very protective and caring towards his younger brother.</p><p>\"My wish upon the star is for Skyler, to be able to get the same treatment,\" says Ricky. \"It feels like Oliver has got a reset in his life, and I want the same thing for Skyler, even though he's a bit older.\"</p><p>Initially it was thought that Oliver was too old for the trial, as the treatment cannot reverse existing damage, but tests showed he was still largely unaffected.</p><p>Skyler seems to take delight in the world around him, and is keen to hold my hand and chat as we walk to the park.</p><p>Ricky explains that Skyler has delayed development in speech and motor skills, but is undergoing infusion therapy, which gets the treatment to his body, but not his brain.</p><p>Oliver returns to Manchester every three months for a few days of follow-up tests.</p><p>In late August, further checks confirm the gene therapy is working.</p><p>Oliver is clearly thriving, and to date is now nine months post treatment.</p><p>Prof Jones, whom Oliver calls Santa because of his white beard, is beaming: \"Before the transplant Ollie didn't make any enzyme at all and now he's making hundreds of times the normal amount.</p><p>\"But more importantly, we can see he's improving, he's learning, he's got new words and new skills and he's moving around much more easily.\"</p><p>However, Prof Jones exercises a degree of caution: \"We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time.\"</p><p>On the rooftop garden at the hospital, Oliver plays with his dad.</p><p>\"He's like a completely different child. He's running around everywhere, he won't stop talking,\" says Ricky.</p><p>\"The future for Ollie seems very bright and hopefully this means more kids will get the treatment.\"</p><p>In all, five boys have been signed up for the trial, from the US, Europe and Australia.  None are from the UK as patients here were diagnosed too late to qualify.</p><p>All the boys will be monitored for at least two years. If the trial is deemed a success, the hospital and university hope to partner with another biotech firm in order to get the treatment licensed.</p><p>Prof Jones says the same gene therapy approach is being applied to other gene disorders.</p><p>There are similar treatments on trial in Manchester for MPS type 1 or Hurler syndrome and MPS type 3 or Sanfilippo syndrome.</p><p>Ricky and Jingru say they are \"eternally grateful\" to the Manchester team for allowing Oliver to join the trial.</p><p>They say they are astonished by his progress in recent months.</p><p>Oliver's now producing the missing enzyme and his body and brain are healthy.</p><p>\"I don't want to jinx it, but I feel like it's gone very, very well,\" says Ricky.</p><p>\"His life is no longer dominated by needles and hospital visits. His speech, agility and cognitive development have all got dramatically better.</p><p>\"It's not just a slow, gradual curve as he gets older, it has shot up exponentially since the transplant.\"</p><p>Researchers at the University of Manchester led by Prof Brian Bigger had spent more than 15 years working on creating the gene therapy for Hunter syndrome.</p><p>In 2020 the university announced a partnership with a small US biotech company Avrobio, to conduct a clinical trial.</p><p>But three years later the company handed back the licence to the university, following poor results from another gene therapy study and a lack of funds.</p><p>The first-in-human trial, which would soon help Oliver, was in jeopardy before it had even begun.</p><p>Prof Jones: \"We had to move very quickly to try to save the whole idea and find another sponsor and another source of funding.\"</p><p>It was then that British medical research charity, LifeArc, stepped in, providing £2.5m of funding.</p><p>CEO Dr Sam Barrell said: \"A huge challenge for the more than 3.5 million people in the UK living with rare conditions, is getting access to effective treatments – currently 95% of conditions have none. \"</p><p>The Chu family are relieved the trial didn't come to a halt and now hope Skyler may one day benefit from the same gene therapy as his brother.</p><p>\"I would walk to the end of the earth, backwards, forwards, upside down, barefoot, to make sure my kids have a better future,\" says Ricky.</p><p>Additional reporting Nat Wright and Brijesh Patel</p><p>Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.</p><p>Toddler Oliver and his dad Ricky join Jon and Sally on the Breakfast sofa, to discuss his progress after his ground-breaking gene therapy.</p><p>One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime.</p><p>The vehicle will contain an X-ray machine and radiographer and will travel to patients who fall.</p><p>Smokefree Sunderland is aiming to cut the city's smoking rate to 5% by 2030 but more work is needed.</p><p>Much like our other organs, our skin begins to age from the moment we are born.

{"details":"<p>Hezbollah says Tabatabai was a member since group’s foundation and held several senior military roles.</p><p>By Justin Salhani</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Israel has attacked the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, killing five people, including Hezbollah’s highest ranking military official.</p><p>Sunday’s attack, which took place amid an uptick in Israeli attacks across Lebanon, was the first on Beirut’s southern suburbs in several months and the first without warning since last year’s ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah’s chief of staff, also known as Sayyid Abu Ali, was among those targeted and killed. This was the third attempt on his life, according to Israeli media, which reported that the two prior attempts occurred during last year’s war with Israel, which culminated in a United States-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.</p><p>Israel has since been accused of violating that ceasefire on a near-daily basis by United Nations experts. Hezbollah has responded to Israel’s continued attacks once, in December.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Before the attack, Tabatabai’s name was not widely known in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s military operatives tend to work in the shadows to avoid Israeli assassinations.</p><p>But since his death on Sunday, it has been revealed that Tabatabai held many senior positions within the armed political group during his tenure.</p><p>He was born in 1968 in Bashoura, a neighbourhood in Beirut, to Lebanese parents although his father reportedly had Iranian roots. He grew up in southern Lebanon and reportedly joined Hezbollah in the 1980s.</p><p>In its official announcement, Hezbollah said Tabatabai had been part of the group since its founding in 1982 as a resistance movement against the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. In the post-war period, Hezbollah grew to become Lebanon’s strongest political party and military force, serving in Lebanon’s parliament and having ministers in several governments.</p><p>Tabatabai was a senior military official in Hezbollah with extensive military experience. He reportedly took part in a number of field operations in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon and led Hezbollah’s Nabatieh axis, or command area, from 1996 until Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000.</p><p>According to Hezbollah, Tabatabai then led the Khiam axis from 2000 until 2008 and was in command during the July 2006 war, which saw Israel and Hezbollah fight to a draw after 34 days. The group also said Tabatabai participated in establishing Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Later, he was responsible for Hezbollah’s operations along the border with Syria and took over responsibilities for the operations branch during last year’s war with Israel.</p><p>According to Israeli media reports, Tabatabai led Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force in Syria and Yemen before replacing Ali Karaki, who was assassinated during last year’s war, as commander of Hezbollah’s southern front.</p><p>He was appointed as Hezbollah’s chief of staff after the war, in which most of Hezbollah’s senior military leaders were killed by Israel.</p><p>“Tabatabai was the one reorganising Hezbollah’s military leadership, and the targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut is an indication that the Lebanese state has no guarantees against the expansion of such attacks,” Sohaib Jawhar, a nonresident fellow at the Beirut-based Badil, the Alternative Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In its statement, Hezbollah confirmed the loss of “the great martyr jihadist commander” known as Sayyid Abu Ali and described Israel’s assassination as a “treacherous attack on the Haret Hreik area in the suburbs of Beirut”.</p><p>Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of the group’s Political Council, lamented “yet another ceasefire violation” and accused Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.</p><p>Hezbollah released a compilation video showing footage of Tabatabai operating in the field.</p><p>It also confirmed the deaths of four other Hezbollah members: Qassem Hussein Berjawi, Rifaat Ahmad Hussein, Mostafa Asaad Berro and Ibrahim Ali Hussein.</p><p>Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar accused Israel of again violating the ceasefire.</p><p>“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty and the security of its citizens,” he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Just two days before the attack, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun announced the government’s intention to enter peace negotiations with Israel with support from the international community.</p><p>After the attack on Sunday, however, Aoun called on the international community to intervene to stop Israeli attacks on his country.</p><p>Frustration has been building in parts of Lebanon as some locals feel the government is not properly equipped or willing to respond to Israel’s repeated aggressions. Many residents in southern Lebanon have expressed feelings of abandonment by the Lebanese government because it has been unable to prevent repeated Israeli attacks or rebuild destroyed homes.</p><p>After Sunday’s strike, Israel said it “remains committed to the understandings agreed upon between the State of Israel and Lebanon”, likely referring to the existing ceasefire.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had been ordered after recommendations from the defence minister and the Israeli army’s chief of staff, and he justified it by accusing Tabatabai of posing a threat to Israeli security.</p><p>The Israeli army released a statement, saying: “Tabatabai commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked extensively to restore their readiness for war with Israel. The [Israeli military] will act against attempts to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah and will operate forcefully to remove any threat against Israel.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>According to the US news website Axios, US officials were aware that an “escalation” was expected but were not informed of the details of this particular strike. An official told Axios the US had been informed by Israel’s government directly after the strike.</p><p>Qmati said Israel’s strike had crossed a “red line” and the group’s leadership would now consider whether a response was warranted.</p><p>“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Who was Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah official killed by Israel?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T18:30:00.000Z"}

A major military-led search and rescue operation is under way for the remaining 265 children and 12 teachers who were taken with them.</p><p>Authorities in several Nigerian states ordered schools to shut following the mass abduction in Niger and another smaller hostage-taking in Kebbi state on Monday when 25 pupils were kidnapped from a boarding school.</p><p>In response to the spate of abductions, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has ordered the recruitment of an additional 30,000 police officers.</p><p>In another development, 38 people abducted from a church service in Kwara state last week were freed on Sunday, the state governor said.</p><p>Two people were killed in the attack on Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku.</p><p>Orders were given for many schools to close in the states of Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Yobe and Kwara.</p><p>News of the children's escape brought welcome relief for families and for a country that has been agonising over the fate of hundreds of abducted schoolchildren.</p><p>However, there is still a lot of confusion and uncertainty in Papiri, the village in Niger state where the children were taken from.</p><p>Parents whose children are still missing told the BBC they feel abandoned. While they expected security officers to be deployed in the village in the wake of the attack on St Mary's School, this has not yet happened.</p><p>President Tinubu's office said on Sunday that all police in Very Important Persons (VIP) protection services had been redeployed to focus on core duties, especially in remote areas prone to attacks.</p><p>A report published earlier this month by the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) said more than a quarter of Nigeria's estimated 371,000-strong police force - 100,000 - were \"assigned to the protection of politicians and VIPs, rather than to tasks serving the general population\".</p><p>VIPs in need of protection will now be able to request armed personnel from the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).</p><p>According to a Christian group involved in the case, the pupils managed to escape between Friday and Saturday in what is being described as a brave and risky attempt to flee their captors.</p><p>The kidnapping of more than 300 schoolchildren surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.</p><p>Local police say armed men stormed St Mary's at around 02:00 (01:00 GMT) on Friday.</p><p>Niger state governor Mohammed Umaru Bongo announced on Saturday that all schools in the area would close, warning that was \"not a time for blame game\".</p><p>Calling for the release of the abductees, Pope Leo XIV expressed \"immense sadness\" and urged the authorities to act swiftly.</p><p>Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... It took everybody by surprise.\"</p><p>One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"</p><p>The military, police and local vigilantes are conducting a search for the children, combing nearby forests and remote routes believed to have been used by the gunmen.</p><p>Authorities in Niger state said St Mary's School had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks. The school has not commented on that allegation.</p><p>The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.</p><p>The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.</p><p>On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state.</p><p>And on Saturday, 14 young farmers in the mainly Muslim Borno state were abducted. One of the women has been rescued by the police.</p><p>The Nigerian president postponed foreign trips - including to last weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.</p><p>Last week's attacks follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria.</p><p>For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians. The Nigerian government has dismissed this claim.</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p>The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".</p><p>An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".</p><p>In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.</p><p>Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.</p><p>In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.</p><p>However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.</p><p>The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok in 2014.</p><p>The incident drew international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.</p><p>Many have since either escaped or been freed, but as many as 100 remain missing.</p><p>Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.</p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica</p><p>The Gambian government says it is hosting Tchiroma Bakary on humanitarian grounds.</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>BBC Africa Eye uncovers two so-called \"juju\" practitioners, who offer to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there is a \"renewed commitment to multilateral co-operation\".</p><p>The authorities in landlocked Ethiopia have ratcheted up rhetoric over access to an Eritrean port.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>Cows in Denmark are falling seriously ill and even dying due to the use of the feed additive Bovaer, a series of viral social media posts claims.</p><p>The posts share videos and supposed testimonies of dairy farmers who have given their cows Bovaer, which is used to reduce methane emissions, in which they refer to the feed additive as \"poison\".</p><p>They say that cows fed with Bovaer are collapsing, developing diarrhoea, producing less milk, becoming infertile and even dying, adding that humans' food supply is also being poisoned as a result.</p><p>Some allege that stopping the use of Bovaer has led to fewer cases of paralysis and diarrhoea, healthier animals and better milk yield, and are calling for a global boycott of the substance.</p><p></p><p>While some online claims may appear hyperbolic and border on conspiracy, they are being published amid a wave of concerns among Danish dairy farmers about the health of their cattle — concerns that authorities in the country are now investigating.</p><p>Bovaer is designed to reduce methane emissions from cows by suppressing an enzyme in their digestive system that is responsible for producing methane. It is said to cut emissions by up to 30% in dairy cows and possibly even more in beef cattle.</p><p>The agricultural sector is the biggest methane emitter in Europe and accounts for about 56% of the EU's methane emissions, according to the European Environment Agency. The digestion process (known as enteric fermentation) in cattle alone accounted for 67% of the sector's methane emissions in the EU in 2020.</p><p>Food safety authorities and independent experts across the world assure that Bovaer is safe for cows, and doesn't make milk or meat from animals that have taken it unsafe for humans to consume.</p><p>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion in 2021, in which it said that Bovaer was effective and safe for dairy cows \"at the maximum recommended level\" and was of no concern for consumer safety or the environment.</p><p>It noted that its active substance, 3‐nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), can irritate the skin and may be hazardous if inhaled, and it couldn't say for sure that it was safe for other animals apart from cows.</p><p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) more recently published a notice in December 2024, explaining that cows metabolise Bovaer, so it doesn't pass to their milk or meat.</p><p>It also said that 3-NOP had passed rigorous safety assessments and that Bovaer posed no safety concerns when used at the approved dose.</p><p>\"It does not cause cancer (it is not carcinogenic or genotoxic) and poses no safety concerns to consumers, animals or the environment,\" the FSA said. \"More than 58 studies on potential risks were evaluated and it was concluded that the additive is safe at twice the recommended dose.\"</p><p>The FSA made the announcement amid a wave of controversy online, after certain British supermarkets teamed up with the Danish-Swedish company Arla Foods for a 90-day trial of Bovaer.</p><p>Some UK social media users at the time raised concerns about Bovaer's safety and poured milk down the sink in protest, while others spread rumours that US businessman Bill Gates was involved in its development and part of the \"conspiracy\".</p><p>Independent animal nutrition experts vouch for the feed additive's safety, stressing that it must be used and administered correctly, and that the scare surrounding it may stem from a misinterpretation of safety warnings on the product's label.</p><p>\"Certain people state it causes fertility issues in males, skin and eye irritation, not suitable for direct human consumption, cancer, et cetera,\" Jan Dijkstra, associate professor in ruminant nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, told The Cube, Euronews' fact-checking team.</p><p>\"However, warnings on Bovaer's safety label are as such: factory staff should wear protective clothing when diluting, dosing, or adding pure Bovaer to cattle feed,\" he added, noting that the final product is indeed safe.</p><p>\"Farmers don't use pure Bovaer,\" Dijkstra said. \"Safety warnings are completely normal for an industrial additive in concentrated powder form.\"</p><p>Bovaer's manufacturer, the Swiss-Dutch company DSM-Firmenich, assures that the additive has been proven safe by more than 15 years of research and is a vital player in reducing global methane emissions.</p><p>\"Bovaer has undergone extensive scientific evaluation, with well over a decade of research and no evidence of adverse health effects in cows,\" a company spokesperson said. \"There are no reported issues in any of the countries where Bovaer is used — beyond what is allegedly reported in Denmark.\"</p><p>The spokesperson added that the additive had been used successfully in the first nine months of the year in Denmark by 400 dairy farmers, without ever being identified as a contributor to health issues in cows.</p><p></p><p>Copenhagen mandated the use of methane-reducing feed at the beginning of 2025 to make its agriculture more climate-friendly, assuring Bovaer's safety.</p><p>However, following reports by some 350 out of around 1,600 Danish farmers of cattle illness and death, certain bodies such as the Danish Food and Veterinary Administration, SEGES Innovation and Aarhus University have begun taking reports of changes in the health and behaviour of dairy cows seriously.</p><p>DSM-Firmenich also told The Cube that the company is working with the investigation to work out what is going on, and that animal welfare is a \"top priority\".</p><p>They want to see whether Bovaer feeding could be contributing to digestive or production changes, or if other factors like diet composition explain why certain farms are reporting challenges but not others.</p><p>Nevertheless, researchers at Aarhus University have previously said that, during their extensive research on the feed additive, they have never observed the symptoms or even the death of cows that some reports have expressed.</p><p>Other experts have repeatedly reached the same conclusion.</p><p>\"Scientific studies indeed sometimes, but not always, show reduced feed intake and milk production; this effect seems to occur more frequently at higher doses of 3-NOP,\" Dijkstra told The Cube. \"It is unclear at the moment if Bovaer is really causing the problem in Denmark. For example, at the same time of introducing Bovaer, half of the farmers reporting problems changed diet composition, like opening the new batch of maize silage harvested a few weeks earlier.\"</p><p>\"So it is simply unclear if Bovaer is causing problems, or if something else happening at the same time is causing it,\" he added. \"We need to take this seriously and investigate, but we also need to stay away from any odd, untrue claims as to infertility and other symptoms mentioned before.\"</p><p></p><p>Dijkstra noted that it was strange that, in light of the reports of cow death and declining health coming from some Danish dairy farmers, none of the dozens of trials reported in scientific literature came back with any serious issues for cows' health.</p><p>\"Some studies report minor reduced feed intake and milk production, but none report issues like 'downer' cows, mastitis, or death,\" he said.</p><p>He pointed to an extensive trial published in the Journal of Dairy Science, which he was involved in, which found that in cows taking Bovaer maintained the same feed intake and even showed an increase in milk production.</p><p>\"Bovaer is used by hundreds of farmers in the Netherlands and Belgium, and other European countries; some farmers have been using it already for several years,\" Dijkstra said. \"No problems have been reported by these farmers, so the Danish situation as to cow health at present is rather unique.\"</p><p>\"We cannot explain it from science, and it is not in line with other practical experiences of farmers elsewhere, nor with scientific experiments,\" he said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Fact check: Are cows in Denmark dying over Bovaer additive?","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/24/fact-check-are-cows-in-denmark-dying-over-bovaer-additive","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T10:19:31.000Z"}
{"details":"<p>Thea Jaffe never expected to use a baby bank. In fact, she was responsible for referring other single parents from her local community group to the charity Little Village, which provides essential supplies for new parents who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford them – everything from strollers and cots to clothes, diapers, toys and books.</p><p>But when Jaffe, who lives in London, became pregnant unexpectedly with her second child, she couldn’t afford to buy everything she needed. “It’s so overwhelming having to accommodate a baby with no budget,” she told CNN.</p><p>“I was already struggling financially… but I didn’t know how bad things were going to get… Now things are at a point where I’m working full time, and I cannot pay my bills.”</p><p>Child poverty has reached a record high in the United Kingdom as the country’s cost of living soars and its social security safety net falters following years of government austerity. With public services much weakened, charities like Little Village have stepped in.</p><p>The issue is firmly under the spotlight this week as campaign groups call on Britain’s Labour government to prioritize measures to reduce child poverty in its annual budget, which will be unveiled on Wednesday.</p><p>Around one-third of Britain’s children – about 4.5 million – now live in relative poverty, often measured as living in a household that earns below 60% of the national median income after housing costs, a government report published in April found.</p><p>One million of these children are destitute, going without their most basic needs of staying warm, dry, clothed and fed being met, according to a 2023 study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which studies poverty and formulates policy to tackle it.</p><p>“We came across one family that were just existing on cornflakes and rice,” Little Village chief executive Sophie Livingstone told CNN.</p><p>“We have lots of families who are in one room, lots of mold, lots of very poor-quality housing even when people are housed,” she added.</p><p>Even for families that are able to meet their children’s basic needs, life is a month-to-month struggle, without any financial security.</p><p>“You just live in fear all the time and that’s not a fun place to be when you’ve got children relying on you,” Lia, a single mother to 7-year-old twin girls, told CNN after being connected through the Changing Realities Project, which documents parents living on low incomes. She asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family’s privacy.</p><p>“They want to do all the same things that their peers are doing… but the budget won’t allow that,” she said. After paying for essentials each month, she has no money left.</p><p>“Every single time I go out, I have to vigilantly and diligently make sure I’m not overspending. That’s a really anxiety-provoking situation to be in.”</p><p>A law graduate who lives in Hampshire, southeast England, Lia initially returned to work but says she would often be called mid-meeting by her childcare provider if one of her daughters, who has complex needs, dyspraxia and global developmental delay, was having a “tantrum or a meltdown.” She eventually had to quit her job.</p><p>“I go into survival mode,” she said. “I was in the (foster) care system growing up and I remember feeling so much struggle and angst like, ‘if I can just get through this, it’ll be ok.’ Yet still, that situation hasn’t changed; as much as I know I have a lot to offer and I try to be a good member of society, I still feel like no matter where I turn, there’s difficulty.”</p><p>And even for families earning well above the poverty line, the cost of housing and childcare, especially in London, can be so high that there is simply no money to spend on anything else. Around 70% of children living in poverty have at least one parent in work.</p><p>Childcare is more expensive in the UK than in most other wealthy countries – costing about 25% of a couple’s and about 60% of a single parent’s net household income, according to figures released by think tank The Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2022.</p><p>Jaffe, the mother who makes use of the Little Village baby bank, works full-time in client solutions and says she earns £45,000 ($59,000) a year to support herself and her three children – well above the UK’s average. Still, she says she is “struggling every month to make sure everything is paid, not able to save anything, not able to do things for my kids.”</p><p>After paying for essentials – rent, childcare, food and household bills – she is left with £192 (around $250) a month for emergencies and to save for the next month in case there’s an error in her next social security payment – something she says is a regular occurrence.</p><p>Although child poverty has always been present in the UK, the rate of it is rising – and much faster than in other wealthy countries. Between 2012 and 2021, it rose by almost 20%, UNICEF found. Now, in 2025, the UK’s child poverty rate is higher than that of any European Union country except Greece, according to the Resolution Foundation, a living standards think tank.</p><p>The organization estimates that another 300,000 children will fall into poverty by 2030 if nothing changes.</p><p>The current poverty rate reflects inequalities present elsewhere in society, too. Almost half of children in Black and Asian communities are living in poverty, compared with 24% of White children, while children living in single-parent families or in families where someone is disabled are also more likely to live in poverty, figures from campaign organization the Child Poverty Action Group show.</p><p>Part of this rise is down to the same economic conditions afflicting other parts of the Western world – sluggish growth, and employment no longer offering the same financial security, as well as stubborn inflation that disproportionately affects essential goods and, therefore, people on low incomes.</p><p>But academics and advocates say policy decisions have also played a part. Britain’s public services were slashed by the center-right Conservative-led coalition and subsequent Conservative government in power from 2010 to 2024.</p><p>And as part of its austerity program, which aimed to reduce public spending in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Conservatives introduced three policies that “are very largely responsible for the increase in child poverty today,” said Jonathan Bradshaw, an emeritus professor of social policy at the University of York who also served as one of the academic advisers to the current government’s upcoming child poverty strategy.</p><p>These limited the amount of welfare people are eligible to claim – one is an overall cap on the benefits a household can receive, another limits housing benefits and the third is a two-child benefit cap, meaning that parents cannot claim anything for their third or subsequent children born after 2017.</p><p>Charities and academics say it is this two-child benefit cap in particular that is largely responsible for Britain’s rising rates of child poverty.</p><p>“Most of the increase in child poverty has occurred in large families,” Bradshaw told CNN.</p><p>All this demonstrates the “inadequacy of the benefits system,” says Peter Matejic, chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p><p>“If you tot up how much you need for food, energy, all these things, and look at how much (benefits are)… it’s below that level,” he told CNN.</p><p>When UN envoys Philip Alston and Olivier De Schutter visited the UK in 2018 and 2023, respectively, they both condemned the poverty they saw there, though De Schutter noted that the country conformed to a pattern of increasing inequality seen in other wealthy countries.</p><p>A spokesperson for the current Labour government, which has been in power since July last year, told CNN that “every child, no matter their background, deserves the best start in life.”</p><p>“We are investing £500 million in children’s development through the rollout of Best Start Family Hubs, extending free school meals and ensuring the poorest don’t go hungry in the holidays through a new £1 billion crisis support package.”</p><p>Addressing child poverty has been a stated priority for the center-left government and, at the same time, an issue that illuminates the fault lines within it.</p><p>Ever since Labour came to power, it has grappled with balancing the mandate for change on which it was elected, and its traditional inclination to invest in public services, with scant available funds and a manifesto pledge not to increase taxes on working people.</p><p>Its plans to reduce child poverty have thus far been stymied by this conundrum. More details of the government’s spending and tax plans are due to be unveiled Wednesday, in which Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the UK’s finance minister, is expected to address the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government has oscillated between keeping and scrapping for the past year.</p><p>But for parents already on the breadline, their household budgets have been stretched too thin, for too long.</p><p>“People have got no resilience left,” says Livingstone, remembering that when she first began her role as the head of Little Village “we were talking about the safety net having lots of holes in it.”</p><p>“I’m actually not sure that there is much of a safety net anymore,” she says.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

However, according to Ukraine's Armed Forces, 69 of them were either shot down or jammed.</p><p>Despite defence efforts, 27 of the drones targeted 12 locations.</p><p>Russian forces also used multiple rocket launchers and glide bombs. A drone strike on Dnipro, a city in central Ukraine, hit a residential building, injuring at least 15 people, including a child, according to local authorities. The strikes sparked fires in both private homes and apartment buildings.</p><p></p><p>Police have received 61 reports of property damage from residents following the overnight attack. Meanwhile, law enforcement officers reportedly remained at the scene, documenting the consequences of the shelling.</p><p>According to the mayor, five houses were damaged in total.

And here's the extraordinary bit: it had never been opened or disturbed since it was first sealed all those centuries ago.</p><p></p><p>\"The peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact,\" said Gabriella Fényes, the excavation's lead archaeologist.</p><p>When the Budapest History Museum team carefully prised open the heavy stone lid –which had been secured with metal clamps and molten lead – they found a complete skeleton surrounded by a treasure trove of artefacts. Inside were two perfectly preserved glass vessels, bronze figures, and an impressive haul of 140 coins. A bone hair pin, amber jewellery, and traces of gold-threaded fabric, along with the skeleton's size, suggest the tomb belonged to a young woman.</p><p></p><p>The coffin had been placed among the ruins of abandoned houses in a quarter of Aquincum that residents had vacated in the 3rd century, which was later turned into a burial ground. Whilst archaeologists also found a Roman aqueduct and eight simpler graves nearby, none came close to matching the richness or pristine condition of this sealed tomb.</p><p>All the objects were \"items given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey,\" Fényes explained.</p><p>\"The deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives. They must have really loved who they buried here,\" she said.</p><p></p><p>During the Roman era, much of modern-day Hungary formed part of the province of Pannonia, whose frontier ran along the Danube's right bank – less than a mile (1.6 kilometres) from where the sarcophagus was found. A legionary camp once stood nearby, guarding the empire's border, and the newly discovered structures are thought to have been part of the civilian settlement that grew up around it.</p><p>Anthropologists will now examine the young woman's remains to learn more about her age, health, and origins. But the grave's location and the abundance of artefacts already tell us quite a bit about who she might have been.</p><p></p><p>The sarcophagus and its contents \"definitely make it stand out,\" said Gergely Kostyál, a Roman-period specialist and co-leader of the project. \"This probably means that the deceased was well-to-do or of a higher social status.\"</p><p>\"It is truly rare to find a sarcophagus like this, untouched and never used before, because in the fourth century it was common to reuse earlier sarcophagi,\" he added. \"It is quite clear that this sarcophagus was made specifically for the deceased.\"</p><p>The excavation team also removed a layer of mud roughly four centimetres thick from inside the coffin, which Fényes hopes might contain even more treasures.</p><p></p><p>\"I suspect we could find jewellery. We haven't found any earrings or other jewellery belonging to the woman, so I hope that these small items will turn up during the sifting of the mud,\" she said.</p><p>For Fényes, the discovery isn't just scientifically significant – it's deeply moving.</p><p>\"I was very touched by the care and expression of love that we were able to get a glimpse of,\" she said. \"Even now, I shudder to think how painful it must have been for the people at that time to bury this young lady.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Ancient Roman sarcophagus unearthed intact in Budapest","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/11/24/truly-rare-archaeologists-uncover-1700-year-old-roman-tomb-in-budapest","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T08:59:27.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Bollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".</p><p>Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.</p><p>Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.</p><p>Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.</p><p>Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.</p><p>Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".</p><p>Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".</p><p>Born on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.</p><p>\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"</p><p>But when he told his family, they were appalled.</p><p>\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"</p><p>But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.</p><p>Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.</p><p>He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.</p><p>In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.</p><p>Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.</p><p>Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.</p><p>Over the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.</p><p>The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra.

The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.</p><p>But despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.</p><p>It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.</p><p>But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.</p><p>\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient.

{"details":"<p>The Trump administration could have expanded authority to take action in Venezuela starting Monday, as the US designates Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization.</p><p>The designation of “Cartel de los Soles,” a phrase that experts say is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group, as a foreign terrorist organization will authorize President Donald Trump to impose fresh sanctions targeting Maduro’s assets and infrastructure. It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts.</p><p>Still, administration officials have been making the case that the designation — one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism tools — will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.</p><p>Cartel de los Soles is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, experts say. The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel, which some experts suggest technically doesn’t exist in a conventional sense.</p><p>The designation, announced November 16, comes as the US military has amassed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon has branded “Operation Southern Spear.” The US military has killed dozens of people in boat strikes as part of the anti-drug-trafficking campaign.</p><p>Trump has been briefed by top officials on a range of options for action inside Venezuela, including strikes on military or government facilities and special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists.</p><p>There is some public opposition to US involvement in the region. According to a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday, 70% of Americans oppose the US taking military action in Venezuela, compared with 30% who favor action. Seventy-six percent of respondents say the Trump administration has not clearly explained the US position on military action.</p><p>Officially, the Trump administration says it is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts. Trump is hoping that the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, according to a US official.</p><p>Trump has expressed some openness to a diplomatic resolution, saying last week that Maduro “would like to talk” and later suggesting that he would be open to speaking with him “at a certain time.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the status of a potential Trump-Maduro conversation.</p><p>In a sign of the escalating tensions, the US on Thursday conducted its largest military display near Venezuela, as at least six US aircraft appeared off the nation’s coast over the course of several hours, including a supersonic F/A-18E fighter jet, a B-52 strategic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft, according to a CNN review of open-source flight data.</p><p>And over the weekend, three international airlines canceled their flights departing from Venezuela after the US Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over the country, according to Reuters.</p><p>CNN’s Avery Schmitz contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>As tech firms race to release new AI tools, users are left unsure how much of their personal data these systems may take.</p><p>By Maria Briceño | PoltiFact</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Leading tech companies are in a race to release and improve artificial intelligence (AI) products, leaving users in the United States to puzzle out how much of their personal data could be extracted to train AI tools.</p><p>Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp), Google and LinkedIn have all rolled out AI app features that have the capacity to draw on users’ public profiles or emails. Google and LinkedIn offer users ways to opt out of the AI features, while Meta’s AI tool provides no means for its users to say “no, thanks.”</p><p>“Gmail just flipped a dangerous switch on October 10, 2025 and 99% of Gmail users have no idea,” a November 8 Instagram post said.</p><p>Posts warned that the platforms’ AI tool rollouts make most private information available for tech company harvesting. “Every conversation, every photo, every voice message, fed into AI and used for profit,” a November 9 X video about Meta said.</p><p>Starting December 16th, Meta will start feeding all your data to AI. This video is an instructional on how to turn these settings off. pic.twitter.com/BUJagaMr5b</p><p>— David Wolfe (@DavidWolfe) November 9, 2025</p><p></p><p>Technology companies are rarely fully transparent when it comes to the user data they collect and what they use it for, Krystyna Sikora, a research analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, told PolitiFact.</p><p>“Unsurprisingly, this lack of transparency can create significant confusion that in turn can lead to fear mongering and the spread of false information about what is and is not permissible,” Sikora said.</p><p>The best – if tedious – way for people to know and protect their privacy rights is to read the terms and conditions, since it often explicitly outlines how the data will be used and whether it will be shared with third parties, Sikora said. The US doesn’t have any comprehensive federal laws on data privacy for technology companies.</p><p>Here’s what we learned about how each platform’s AI is handling your data:</p><p>Social media claim: “Starting December 16th Meta will start reading your DMs, every conversation, every photo, every voice message fed into AI and used for profit.” – November 9 X post with 1.6 million views as of November 19.</p><p>The facts: Meta announced a new policy to take effect December 16, but that policy alone does not result in your direct messages, photos and voice messages being fed into its AI tool. The policy involves how Meta will customise users’ content and advertisements based on how they interact with Meta AI.</p><p>For example, if a user interacts with Meta’s AI chatbot about hiking, Meta might start showing that person recommendations for hiking groups or hiking boots.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean your data isn’t being used for AI purposes. Although Meta doesn’t use people’s private messages in Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger to train its AI, it does collect user content that is set to “public” mode. This can include photos, posts, comments and reels. If the user’s Meta AI conversations involve religious views, sexual orientation and racial or ethnic origin, Meta says the system is designed to avoid parlaying these interactions into ads. If users ask questions of Meta AI using its voice feature, Meta says the AI tool will use the microphone only when users give permission.</p><p>There is a caveat: The tech company says its AI might use information about people who don’t have Meta product accounts if their information appears in other users’ public posts. For example, if a Meta user mentions a non-user in a public image caption, that photo and caption could be used to train Meta AI.</p><p>Can you opt out? No. If you are using Meta platforms in these ways – making some of your posts public and using the chatbot – your data could be used by Meta AI. There is no way to deactivate Meta AI in Instagram, Facebook or Threads. WhatsApp users can deactivate the option to talk with Meta AI in their chats, but this option is available only per chat, meaning that you must deactivate the option in each chat’s advanced privacy settings.</p><p>The X post inaccurately advised people to submit this form to opt out. But the form is simply a way for users to report when Meta’s AI supplies an answer that contains someone’s personal information.</p><p>David Evan Harris, who teaches AI ethics at the University of California, Berkeley, told PolitiFact that because the US has no federal regulations about privacy and AI training, people have no standardised legal right to opt out of AI training in the way that people in countries such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom and South Korea do.</p><p>Even when social media platforms provide opt-out options for US customers, it’s often difficult to find the settings to do so, Harris said.</p><p>Deleting your Meta accounts does not eliminate the possibility of Meta AI using your past public data, Meta’s spokesperson said.</p><p>Social media claim: “Did you know Google just gave its AI access to read every email in your Gmail – even your attachments?”  – November 8 Instagram post with more than 146,000 likes as of November 19.</p><p>The facts: Google has a host of products that interact with private data in different ways. Google announced on November 5 that its AI product, Gemini Deep Research, can connect to users’ other Google products, including Gmail, Drive and Chat. But, as Forbes reported, users must first give permission to employ the tool.</p><p>Users who want to allow Gemini Deep Research to have access to private information across products can choose what data sources to employ, including Google search, Gmail, Drive and Google Chat.</p><p>There are other ways Google collects people’s data:</p><p>A Google spokesperson told PolitiFact the company doesn’t use this information to train AI when registered users are under age 13.</p><p>Google can also access people’s data when they have smart features activated in their Gmail and Google Workplace settings (that are automatically on in the US), which gives Google consent to draw on email content and user activity data to help users compose emails or suggest Google Calendar events. With optional paid subscriptions, users can access additional AI features, including in-app Gemini summaries.</p><p>Turning off Gmail’s smart features can stop Google’s AI from accessing Gmail, but it doesn’t stop Google’s access to the Gemini app, which users can either download or access in a browser.</p><p>A California lawsuit accuses Gemini of spying on users’ private communications. The lawsuit says an October policy change gives Gemini default access to private content such as emails and attachments in people’s Gmail, Chat and Meet. Before October, users had to manually allow Gemini to access the private content; now, users must go into their privacy settings to disable it. The lawsuit claims the Google policy update violates California’s 1967 Invasion of Privacy Act, a law that prohibits unauthorised wiretapping and recording confidential communications without consent.</p><p>Can you opt out? If people don’t want their conversations used to train Google AI, they can use “temporary” chats or chat without signing into their Gemini accounts. Doing that means Gemini can’t save a person’s chat history, a Google spokesperson said. Otherwise, opting out of having Google’s AI in Gmail, Drive and Meet requires turning off smart features in settings.</p><p>Social media claim: Starting November 3, “LinkedIn will begin using your data to train AI.” – November 2 Instagram post with more than 18,000 likes as of November 19.</p><p>The facts: LinkedIn, owned by Microsoft, announced on its website that starting November 3, it will use some US members’ data to train content-generating AI models.</p><p>The data the AI collects includes details from people’s profiles and public content that users post.</p><p>The training does not draw on information from people’s private messages, LinkedIn said.</p><p>LinkedIn also said, aside from the AI data access, that Microsoft started receiving information about LinkedIn members – such as profile information, feed activity and ad engagement – as of November 3 in order to target users with personalised ads.</p><p>Can you opt out? Yes. Autumn Cobb, a LinkedIn spokesperson, confirmed to PolitiFact that members can opt out if they don’t want their content used for AI training purposes. They can also opt out of receiving targeted, personalised ads.</p><p>To remove your data from being used for training purposes, go to data privacy, click on the option that says “Data for Generative AI Improvement” and then turn off the feature that says “use my data for training content creation AI models.”</p><p>And to opt out of personalised ads, go to advertising data in settings, and turn off ads on LinkedIn and the option that says “data sharing with our affiliates and select partners”.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Are tech companies training their AI with private data?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/are-tech-companies-using-your-private-data-to-train-ai-models","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T18:30:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Live Updates</p><p>• US President Donald Trump says “something good just may be happening” following talks in Geneva yesterday on a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Those discussions continue on a technical level today and EU leaders are also meeting for further talks.</p><p>• Meanwhile, the Kremlin says it has not yet received any official information on the outcome of yesterday’s talks. They were praised by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as “substantive.”</p><p>• Washington said the Ukrainians believe the current draft amendment of Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war “reflects their national security interests.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that a Thursday deadline set by Trump for Ukraine to accept it, is fluid.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has just been speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal EU meeting.</p><p>She says the talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday established a “solid basis for moving forward” in peace negotiations.</p><p>Coordination between European countries and a “strong European presence” at the talks “has allowed us to make good progress in the negotiations for just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>“While work remains to be done. There is now a solid basis for moving forward,” she added, urging countries to “remain united” and “keep placing Ukraine’s best interests at the center of our efforts.”</p><p>“This is about the security of our entire continent, now and in (the) future,” von der Leyen said. “Today’s meeting in Luanda reaffirmed that we are united in our support of Ukraine. These are our core European principles moving forward,” she added, stressing that Ukraine’s “territory and sovereignty must be respected.”</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of homes across Ukraine were without power this morning, after overnight Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country.</p><p>More than 60,000 households in the Dnipropetrovsk region were affected by the lack of power, Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator, said in a statement. Another 10,000 homes in the Kharkiv region were also without energy, it said.</p><p>For context: Read our analysis here on how Russian forces are exploiting their manpower advantage to edge forward in multiple parts of Ukraine.</p><p>Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid are a regular occurrence. Since late September, strikes on key power infrastructure have taken place almost daily, depriving Ukrainians of energy and heat ahead of the bitter winter months.</p><p>Emergency repair work is continuing “wherever security conditions allow,” Ukrenergo said in its statement today. “Energy companies are doing everything possible to restore the equipment damaged by the enemy as quickly as possible.”</p><p>The United Kingdom, France and Germany had drafted a counter-proposal to the US plan with an array of key changes, Reuters has reported. A European official and a European diplomatic source confirmed the text’s accuracy to CNN’s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was striking out the language regarding the restriction of further NATO expansion. According to the draft text obtained by Reuters, the European plan states:</p><p>The European version also removed references to territorial concessions and the US proposal’s recognition of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk as de facto Russian territory.</p><p>The European draft text additionally includes a higher figure for the proposed limit on the Ukrainian military during peacetime, saying it will be capped at 800,000.</p><p>As we’ve reported, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that discussions on a plan to end the war in Ukraine would continue on a technical level today, as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also praised the “substantive” results from yesterday’s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Catch up on how the talks went:</p><p>From Kharkiv region in the north to the farmland of Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces in Ukraine are edging forward, exploiting gaps in Ukrainian defenses and a vast numerical superiority.</p><p>Russia has concentrated more than 150,000 troops in the Pokrovsk direction of Donetsk alone, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.</p><p>Russia is likely losing some 30,000 soldiers killed or wounded every month, according to western analysts. But it’s recruiting a similar number and has caught up with Ukraine in deploying a wide range of attack drones.</p><p>Mobilizing enough soldiers has become a crisis for Ukraine. More than 250,000 criminal cases have been opened into soldiers going AWOL since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Many units are seriously under staffed; for those who do serve rotations out of the frontlines get fewer and shorter.</p><p>The shortage is compounded by the sheer size of the battlefield – 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles) long from the Black Sea to the Russian border.</p><p>The south has become a hotspot as Russian forces have gradually advanced toward the city of Zaporizhzhia. They are now some 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the city and 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the south.</p><p>“Ukraine may now be approaching the point when the country no longer has enough fighters to effectively defend the full length of the front lines,” according to one analysis.</p><p>Ukraine may be able to step up its deep strikes against Russian energy and military infrastructure. But the Kremlin will see no reason to make concessions at the negotiating table while its troops are on the front-foot.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, a day after intensive talks were held between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</p><p></p><p>Trump’s comments come less than 24 hours after a previous Truth Social post where he scolded Ukrainian leadership for reportedly showing “zero gratitude” to the US for its efforts in ending the conflict.</p><p>After a day of intensive talks in Geneva on Sunday, however, US officials appear to be more optimistic that progress can be made to end the war, as we’ve reported.</p><p>We’ve seen a statement this morning from European Council President António Costa.</p><p>He said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning, to “get his assessment of the situation” ahead of the informal EU leaders’ meeting on Ukraine today.</p><p>“A united and coordinated EU position is key in ensuring a good outcome of peace negotiations - for Ukraine and for Europe,” Costa said on social media.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said it has not received any official information regarding the outcome of yesterday’s Ukraine ceasefire talks held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Look, we haven’t seen any plan yet,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing on Monday, adding that Russia would not comment on the details of the draft agreement.</p><p>“We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been plentiful over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Based on initial media reports, Peskov said, “Some adjustments have been made to the peace plan text we saw earlier. But we’ll wait and see.”</p><p>Peskov also said there are “no plans yet” for talks with the US delegation this week, and that Moscow remains open for such contacts.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukraine will continue to work closely with the United States on a proposed plan to end the fighting in his country but stressed the importance of ensuring that any plan strengthens Ukraine’s security.</p><p>“Right now, we are at a critical moment, and we are working closely with the United States, with European partners, with many, many others to define steps that can end Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, and bring real security,” he told a Swedish parliamentary summit by video link.</p><p></p><p>“We will all continue working with partners, especially the United States, looking for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken, us. And we will explain how dangerous it is to pretend that aggression is something one can simply overlook and move on,” he said.</p><p>Zelensky added that Ukraine has successfully convinced Washington to keep “extremely sensitive points” on the table, including securing the full release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, amid ongoing talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>He also called on European nations to make decisions regarding the seizing of Russian assets and said Moscow must “pay fully” for the war.</p><p>America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva on Sunday, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.</p><p>“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.</p><p>“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”</p><p></p><p>But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.</p><p>The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.</p><p>Read the full analysis here.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that talks between the United States and Ukraine in Geneva on amending a 28-point plan to end Russia’s war had produced a “decisive success” for Europeans.</p><p>“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan — this is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,” Wadephul told Deutschlandfunk radio.</p><p>“It was clear from the outset, as we have repeatedly said, that any agreement must not be reached over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he added.</p><p></p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism yesterday after what he described as productive discussions between American and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The talks were “probably the most productive and meaningful” so far, Rubio told reporters after the first session.</p><p>The 28-point peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump continues to evolve as the delegates work to achieve terms that would be acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia, Rubio said.</p><p>“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” he said, “The items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today,” he said.</p><p>The US proposal had attracted bipartisan criticism for its concessions to Russia. The plan puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military’s size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war — all long-standing Kremlin demands.</p><p>Amid the scrutiny, a US State Department spokesperson maintained that the proposal was “authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”</p><p>The White House on Sunday said “revisions and clarifications” were made to the proposal with input from top US, Ukrainian, and European officials in Geneva, adding that the Ukrainians believe that the current draft “reflects their national security interests.”</p><p>We’ll bring you key developments and the latest from any further talks today, stay with us.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Social media app offers users a range of options for age verification as Australia prepares to enforce social media ban for children younger than 16.</p><p>By Lyndal Rowlands and News Agencies</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Snapchat has begun asking children and teenagers in Australia to verify their ages, including with software owned by the country’s banks, according to a company spokesperson.</p><p>The move on Monday comes as Australia prepares to enforce a world-first social media ban for children under the age of 16 starting on December 10.</p><p>The law, which threatens social media platforms with a fine of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($31.95m) for noncompliance, is one of the world’s toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.</p><p>In addition to Snapchat, the ban currently applies to YouTube, X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Twitch and Kick.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, Snapchat said users will be able to verify their age through the ConnectID application, which links to their bank accounts, or by using software owned by Singapore-headquartered age-assurance provider, k-ID.</p><p>ConnectID, which is owned and used by most major Australian banks, said it would send the tech platform a “yes/no” signal about whether the person was over 16 based on their account details, without making them upload sensitive information.</p><p>“The goal here is to protect young people online without creating new privacy risks,” said ConnectID managing director Andrew Black in a statement.</p><p>In the k-ID option, users can upload government-issued identification cards to verify their ages or submit photos, which the application will then use to estimate an age range.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Snapchat has previously said it believes about 440,000 of its users in Australia are aged between 13 and 15.</p><p>Snapchat added that it “strongly disagreed” with the Australian government’s assessment that it should be included in the social media ban, claiming its service provides a “visual messaging app”.</p><p>“Disconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn’t make them safer – it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,” it warned.</p><p>Some other apps have been able to secure an exception from the ban, including Discord, WhatsApp, Lego Play and Pinterest. But Australian authorities have reserved the right to update the list of banned platforms as required.</p><p>A number of young people and advocates have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of the new ban, including 18-year-old journalist and founder of youth news service 6 News Australia Leo Puglisi, who told an Australian Senate inquiry that the ban will affect young people’s access to information.</p><p>UNICEF Australia has also expressed concerns about implementation, saying the changes proposed by the Australian government “won’t fix the problems young people face online”.</p><p>“Social media has a lot of good things, like education and staying in touch with friends,” UNICEF Australia said in a statement.</p><p>“We think it’s more important to make social media platforms safer and to listen to young people to make sure any changes actually help.”</p><p>Katrina Lines, the CEO of children’s therapy provider Act for Kids, said that parents should start having conversations with children as soon as possible about how they can stay connected as the ban comes into effect over the coming weeks.</p><p>“It’s important to keep the lines of communication open in the lead up to and even long after these changes take effect,” Lines said.</p><p>Act for Kids said it surveyed more than 300 Australian children aged 10 to 16, and found 41 percent would prefer to connect with family in real life compared to only 15 percent who preferred to spend time online. But Lines said families still need to work out how to improve in-person connections.</p><p>“One way of starting this conversation could be by asking them how they would like to stay connected to friends and family outside of social media,” she said.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Australian ban comes amid growing global concern over the effects of social media on children’s health and safety, and companies including TikTok, Snapchat, Google and Meta Platforms – the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp – are facing lawsuits in the United States for their role in fuelling a mental health crisis.</p><p>Regulators around the world are closely watching whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work.</p><p>Malaysia’s Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said on Sunday that the Malaysian government also plans to ban social media for users under the age of 16, starting from next year.</p><p>He said the government was reviewing the mechanisms used in Australia and other nations to impose age restrictions for social media use, citing a need to protect youths from online harms such as cyberbullying, financial scams and child sexual abuse.</p><p>“We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” he told reporters, according to a video of his remarks posted online by local daily The Star.</p><p>In New Zealand, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is also planning to introduce a similar bill to restrict children’s social media use, while Indonesia, too, has said it is preparing legislation to protect young people from “physical, mental, or moral perils”.</p><p>In Europe, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Greece are jointly testing a template for an age verification app, while the Dutch government has advised parents to forbid children under 15 from using social media apps like TikTok and Snapchat.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Snapchat starts age checks in Australia ahead of teen social media ban","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/snapchat-starts-age-checks-in-australia-ahead-of-teen-social-media-ban","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-23T18:30:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Live Updates</p><p>• US President Donald Trump says “something good just may be happening” following talks in Geneva yesterday on a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Those discussions continue on a technical level today and EU leaders are also meeting for further talks.</p><p>• Meanwhile, the Kremlin says it has not yet received any official information on the outcome of yesterday’s talks. They were praised by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as “substantive.”</p><p>• Washington said the Ukrainians believe the current draft amendment of Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war “reflects their national security interests.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that a Thursday deadline set by Trump for Ukraine to accept it, is fluid.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has just been speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal EU meeting.</p><p>She says the talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday established a “solid basis for moving forward” in peace negotiations.</p><p>Coordination between European countries and a “strong European presence” at the talks “has allowed us to make good progress in the negotiations for just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>“While work remains to be done. There is now a solid basis for moving forward,” she added, urging countries to “remain united” and “keep placing Ukraine’s best interests at the center of our efforts.”</p><p>“This is about the security of our entire continent, now and in (the) future,” von der Leyen said. “Today’s meeting in Luanda reaffirmed that we are united in our support of Ukraine. These are our core European principles moving forward,” she added, stressing that Ukraine’s “territory and sovereignty must be respected.”</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of homes across Ukraine were without power this morning, after overnight Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country.</p><p>More than 60,000 households in the Dnipropetrovsk region were affected by the lack of power, Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator, said in a statement. Another 10,000 homes in the Kharkiv region were also without energy, it said.</p><p>For context: Read our analysis here on how Russian forces are exploiting their manpower advantage to edge forward in multiple parts of Ukraine.</p><p>Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid are a regular occurrence. Since late September, strikes on key power infrastructure have taken place almost daily, depriving Ukrainians of energy and heat ahead of the bitter winter months.</p><p>Emergency repair work is continuing “wherever security conditions allow,” Ukrenergo said in its statement today. “Energy companies are doing everything possible to restore the equipment damaged by the enemy as quickly as possible.”</p><p>The United Kingdom, France and Germany had drafted a counter-proposal to the US plan with an array of key changes, Reuters has reported. A European official and a European diplomatic source confirmed the text’s accuracy to CNN’s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was striking out the language regarding the restriction of further NATO expansion. According to the draft text obtained by Reuters, the European plan states:</p><p>The European version also removed references to territorial concessions and the US proposal’s recognition of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk as de facto Russian territory.</p><p>The European draft text additionally includes a higher figure for the proposed limit on the Ukrainian military during peacetime, saying it will be capped at 800,000.</p><p>As we’ve reported, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that discussions on a plan to end the war in Ukraine would continue on a technical level today, as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also praised the “substantive” results from yesterday’s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Catch up on how the talks went:</p><p>From Kharkiv region in the north to the farmland of Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces in Ukraine are edging forward, exploiting gaps in Ukrainian defenses and a vast numerical superiority.</p><p>Russia has concentrated more than 150,000 troops in the Pokrovsk direction of Donetsk alone, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.</p><p>Russia is likely losing some 30,000 soldiers killed or wounded every month, according to western analysts. But it’s recruiting a similar number and has caught up with Ukraine in deploying a wide range of attack drones.</p><p>Mobilizing enough soldiers has become a crisis for Ukraine. More than 250,000 criminal cases have been opened into soldiers going AWOL since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Many units are seriously under staffed; for those who do serve rotations out of the frontlines get fewer and shorter.</p><p>The shortage is compounded by the sheer size of the battlefield – 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles) long from the Black Sea to the Russian border.</p><p>The south has become a hotspot as Russian forces have gradually advanced toward the city of Zaporizhzhia. They are now some 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of the city and 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the south.</p><p>“Ukraine may now be approaching the point when the country no longer has enough fighters to effectively defend the full length of the front lines,” according to one analysis.</p><p>Ukraine may be able to step up its deep strikes against Russian energy and military infrastructure. But the Kremlin will see no reason to make concessions at the negotiating table while its troops are on the front-foot.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, a day after intensive talks were held between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”</p><p></p><p>Trump’s comments come less than 24 hours after a previous Truth Social post where he scolded Ukrainian leadership for reportedly showing “zero gratitude” to the US for its efforts in ending the conflict.</p><p>After a day of intensive talks in Geneva on Sunday, however, US officials appear to be more optimistic that progress can be made to end the war, as we’ve reported.</p><p>We’ve seen a statement this morning from European Council President António Costa.</p><p>He said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning, to “get his assessment of the situation” ahead of the informal EU leaders’ meeting on Ukraine today.</p><p>“A united and coordinated EU position is key in ensuring a good outcome of peace negotiations - for Ukraine and for Europe,” Costa said on social media.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said it has not received any official information regarding the outcome of yesterday’s Ukraine ceasefire talks held in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Look, we haven’t seen any plan yet,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing on Monday, adding that Russia would not comment on the details of the draft agreement.</p><p>“We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been plentiful over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Based on initial media reports, Peskov said, “Some adjustments have been made to the peace plan text we saw earlier. But we’ll wait and see.”</p><p>Peskov also said there are “no plans yet” for talks with the US delegation this week, and that Moscow remains open for such contacts.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukraine will continue to work closely with the United States on a proposed plan to end the fighting in his country but stressed the importance of ensuring that any plan strengthens Ukraine’s security.</p><p>“Right now, we are at a critical moment, and we are working closely with the United States, with European partners, with many, many others to define steps that can end Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, and bring real security,” he told a Swedish parliamentary summit by video link.</p><p></p><p>“We will all continue working with partners, especially the United States, looking for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken, us. And we will explain how dangerous it is to pretend that aggression is something one can simply overlook and move on,” he said.</p><p>Zelensky added that Ukraine has successfully convinced Washington to keep “extremely sensitive points” on the table, including securing the full release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, amid ongoing talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>He also called on European nations to make decisions regarding the seizing of Russian assets and said Moscow must “pay fully” for the war.</p><p>America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva on Sunday, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.</p><p>“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.</p><p>“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”</p><p></p><p>But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.</p><p>The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.</p><p>Read the full analysis here.</p><p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Monday that talks between the United States and Ukraine in Geneva on amending a 28-point plan to end Russia’s war had produced a “decisive success” for Europeans.</p><p>“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan — this is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,” Wadephul told Deutschlandfunk radio.</p><p>“It was clear from the outset, as we have repeatedly said, that any agreement must not be reached over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he added.</p><p></p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism yesterday after what he described as productive discussions between American and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The talks were “probably the most productive and meaningful” so far, Rubio told reporters after the first session.</p><p>The 28-point peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump continues to evolve as the delegates work to achieve terms that would be acceptable to both Ukraine and Russia, Rubio said.</p><p>“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” he said, “The items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today,” he said.</p><p>The US proposal had attracted bipartisan criticism for its concessions to Russia. The plan puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military’s size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war — all long-standing Kremlin demands.</p><p>Amid the scrutiny, a US State Department spokesperson maintained that the proposal was “authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”</p><p>The White House on Sunday said “revisions and clarifications” were made to the proposal with input from top US, Ukrainian, and European officials in Geneva, adding that the Ukrainians believe that the current draft “reflects their national security interests.”</p><p>We’ll bring you key developments and the latest from any further talks today, stay with us.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Hezbollah confirms death of ‘great commander’ Haytham Ali Tabatabai, and says the Israeli attacks ‘open door to escalation of assaults’.</p><p>By Al Jazeera Staff</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Hezbollah has confirmed that its top military commander Haytham Ali Tabatabai has been killed in an Israeli air strike on Lebanon’s capital.</p><p>Tabatabai, the chief of staff of the group’s armed wing, was among at least five people killed in the attack on an apartment block in the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh in southern Beirut on Sunday.</p><p>In a statement, Hezbollah said “the great commander” Tabatabai was killed in “a treacherous Israeli attack on the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Beirut”, without specifying his position within the group.</p><p>Tabatabai is the most senior Hezbollah commander to be killed by Israel since the start of a November 2024 ceasefire aimed at ending over a year of hostilities between the two.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Israeli military said it “eliminated” Tabatabai in the strike, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office earlier said he was the target of the attack. Israeli media said it was the military’s third attempt to kill him since last year’s war.</p><p>Senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qmati had earlier said that Israel’s strike crossed a “red line” and that the group’s leadership was considering whether it would respond.</p><p>“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.</p><p>Tabatabai was born in 1968 in Beirut to a Lebanese mother and an Iranian father. He grew up in southern Lebanon and reportedly joined Hezbollah in the 1980s.</p><p>Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said the Israeli attack also wounded 28 people.</p><p>Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported that two missiles were fired at the apartment building on al-Arid Street in Haret Hreik, and significant damage was inflicted on cars and surrounding buildings.</p><p>Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said there is a growing concern in Lebanon that Israel, “which has been acting with impunity, will increase its strikes”.</p><p>“Hezbollah is in a difficult position,” she said. “It has lost its deterrence capabilities, and without a response, it could invite more Israeli attacks. But if it does respond, it could trigger a bigger Israeli bombardment that could hurt its support base.”</p><p>Ali Rizk, a security affairs analyst, told Al Jazeera that a major question now is how Hezbollah is going to respond.</p><p>“In my humble opinion, I don’t think Hezbollah is ready to give Netanyahu what he wants, meaning to give Netanyahu an excuse to launch an all-out war against Lebanon once again. That could help Netanyahu’s political chances. It could also be very costly,” he said.</p><p>Lebanese President Joseph Aoun called on the international community to intervene firmly to stop the Israeli attacks on the country.</p><p>In a statement earlier on Sunday, Aoun said Lebanon “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Israel assassinated longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air attack on southern Beirut just over a year ago.</p><p>Sunday’s strike came only days before Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to visit the country amid intensified Israeli aggression in recent weeks.</p><p>Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar said Israel has been striking all of Lebanon since the ceasefire agreement was brokered by the United States about a year ago.</p><p>“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty, and the security of its citizens,” he said.</p><p>Israel has been carrying out near-daily strikes on southern Lebanon and has also attacked Beirut several times, but the capital had not been hit in the past several months.</p><p>At least 13 people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon this week, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.</p><p>A drone hit a car on Tuesday in the car park of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run NNA reported.</p><p>Israel and the US have been piling pressure on Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah.</p><p>The Lebanese military issued a plan that the government approved in September that would disarm Hezbollah across the country by the end of the year. Hezbollah has refused to comply while Israel continues to bomb the country and occupy parts of the south.</p><p>Israel has said Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its military capabilities in southern Lebanon, though the Lebanese government has denied those claims.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Israel kills top Hezbollah commander in attack on Lebanon’s capital","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/23/israel-bombs-southern-suburbs-of-beirut","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-22T18:30:00.000Z"}
{"details":"<p>A weakened Ukrainian president can now easily be turned into a scapegoat for defeat.</p><p>By Leonid Ragozin</p><p>Leonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Riga.</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>On November 10, the Ukrainian anticorruption authorities revealed that close associates of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were allegedly involved in a scheme to embezzle $100m from Ukraine’s energy sector.</p><p>Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.</p><p>The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.</p><p>Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.</p><p>What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.</p><p>Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.</p><p>That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.</p><p>It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.</p><p>The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.</p><p>Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.</p><p>It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.</p><p>To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.</p><p>The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.</p><p>But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.</p><p>He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.</p><p>A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.</p><p>The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.</p><p>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"A corruption scandal may well end the war in Ukraine","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/11/23/a-corruption-scandal-may-well-end-the-war-in-ukraine","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-22T18:30:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Israel kills top Hezbollah commander only two days after Lebanon’s president said he was open to negotiations.</p><p>By Justin Salhani</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Israel has killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, which comes only two days after Lebanon’s president announced the country had succumbed to an Israeli pressure campaign and agreed to hold negotiations.</p><p>Hezbollah confirmed that its chief of staff, Haytham Ali Tabtabai, was among five people killed and 28 others wounded in the Israeli strike on Beirut’s Haret Hreik neighbourhood on Sunday.</p><p>Israeli officials and media have warned of a renewed escalation against Lebanon in recent weeks, claiming Hezbollah is regrouping and rearming. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.</p><p>“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.</p><p>Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.</p><p>Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite an ostensible ceasefire, Israel has intensified attacks in Lebanon’s south and Bekaa Valley in recent days. At least 13 people were killed by an Israeli strike on Lebanon’s largest Palestinian refugee camp last week, in an attack that killed mostly children and marked the highest death toll in a single strike since a ceasefire was agreed in November last year.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since then, including around 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. It also continues to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon, despite the ceasefire stating Israel would withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory.</p><p>“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”</p><p>Tabtabai’s killing marks the highest-ranking Hezbollah target killed since the ceasefire. The attack also came a week to the day before Pope Leo XIV’s planned visit to the country and a day after Lebanon mutedly celebrated its 82nd independence day.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet approved a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.</p><p>Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.</p><p>The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.</p><p>“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks once. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.</p><p>Still, there are concerns in Lebanon that the group may decide to soon change tactics.</p><p>“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”</p><p>Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.</p><p>Analysts said many in the country fervently oppose direct negotiations, though the government has expressed a willingness to enter indirect talks, similar to 2022’s maritime agreement between Israel and Lebanon.</p><p>Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.</p><p>But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has repeatedly violated.</p><p>“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Israel’s bombing of Beirut comes days after Lebanon agreed to talks","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-22T18:30:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Top diplomats from the US, EU and Ukraine are meeting in Geneva to discuss Donald Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia.</p><p>By Yashraj Sharma</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Top United States officials are holding talks with Ukrainian and European diplomats in Geneva to discuss US President Donald Trump’s peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>But the so-called 28-point plan pushed by the Trump administration has alarmed Ukraine and its European allies, who see it as a capitulation to Russian demands, particularly territorial concessions and limits on the size of Ukraine’s military.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Trump had set a November 27 deadline for Ukraine to accept his peace plan, but after pushback from European leaders, Washington appears to have softened its stance, with Trump saying the plan did not represent a “final offer” for Ukraine.</p><p>This will likely create some wriggle room for diplomacy at the high-stakes talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>So, why are Ukraine’s European allies opposed to the draft plan? Who’s participating? What’s on the agenda in Geneva? And does the plan favour Moscow?</p><p>The talks are an attempt to reconcile the contentious draft peace plan, as Kyiv and its European allies want Kyiv’s long-term security interests protected.</p><p>Representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will join top US officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss how to end the war – Europe’s deadliest since World War II. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there will also be a Russian presence.</p><p>The talks, Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, “could be the most decisive moment for Ukraine”.</p><p>“There is a great deal of anxiety among Ukrainians and Europeans about the nature of the 28-plan drafted by the Americans,” said Ahelbarra, reporting from Geneva.</p><p>“The concerns are about the territorial concessions: We’re talking about Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which the Ukrainians, as per the plan, have to give up in exchange for the potential of a permanent deal with Russia. They have to freeze the front lines, particularly in Kherson and Zaporizhia.</p><p>“The third element is the reduction of the capacity of the Ukrainian armed forces from 900,000 soldiers to 600,000, and this is widely perceived by the Ukrainians as a major concession they cannot afford to make,” Ahelbarra said.</p><p>In a post on X on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hopes “there will be a result”.</p><p>“The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I am awaiting the results of today’s talks and hope that all participants will be constructive. We all need a positive outcome.”</p><p>The US’s Rubio and Witkoff are leading the Geneva talks, which will also include US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.</p><p>Nine Ukrainian officials are attending the talks, including Ukraine’s presidential office chief Andriy Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, who have been empowered to deal directly with Russia by the president.</p><p>National security advisers from the E3 alliance of France, Britain and Germany will also join the discussions, alongside other officials from the EU, including Italy.</p><p>Ukraine’s European allies say the current peace plan does not address Ukraine’s security concerns. They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.</p><p>She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.</p><p>“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.</p><p>On the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, European and other Western leaders pushed back against Trump’s plan, saying it required “additional work”.</p><p>“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has since captured large parts of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region. Moscow had annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.</p><p>According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</p><p>The proposed plan would also see Ukraine cut its army and renounce its ambitions to join NATO, which has been a major sticking point in the earlier proposals. The size of the Ukrainian armed forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.</p><p>“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during the G20 summit briefing. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”</p><p>Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.</p><p>Speaking with reporters ahead of the G20 summit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, “Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words.”</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.</p><p>In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.</p><p>Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.</p><p>EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”</p><p>But US Vice President JD Vance has rebuked criticism of the peace plan.</p><p>“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”</p><p>Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was trying to defend its sovereignty while retaining the support of its most important ally, the United States. Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.</p><p>“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.</p><p>In a 10-minute speech outside the presidential palace, Zelenskyy said that if his country follows through on the proposed plan, it would leave Kyiv “without freedom, dignity and justice”.</p><p>Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I will present arguments, I will persuade, I will propose alternatives,” said the Ukrainian president. He then referred to the Russian invasion in February 2022, saying: “We did not betray Ukraine then, we will not do so now.”</p><p>On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.</p><p>“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p><p>European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.</p><p>A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.</p><p>“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.</p><p>However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.”</p><p>Later, a US Department of State spokesperson said Rounds’s account of his conversation with Rubio was “blatantly false”.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, said Washington’s 28-point plan could “lay the foundation for a final peace settlement”.</p><p>Putin also threatened to seize more territory if Ukraine does not accept the proposal, warning that the reported capture of the Ukrainian city of Kupiansk “will inevitably be repeated in other key areas of the front line”.</p><p>Speaking from Kyiv, journalist Audrey MacAlpine said Russia has been making battlefield gains in regions of Ukraine where the peace proposal would hand it territory along the line of contact.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera that Moscow had carried out overnight attacks on Kherson and Zaporizhia, two regions where Russia would gain de facto control under the 28-point plan being discussed in Geneva.</p><p>“No doubt Russia is trying to make gains in these particular regions, and they’ve been successful,” she said. “They’ve been making slow but concerted gains.”</p><p>We do not know yet.</p><p>During his presidential campaign leading up to the 2024 US election, Trump claimed that he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within a day. But a deal proved elusive despite Washington’s diplomatic push.</p><p>Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has made resolving foreign conflicts central to US foreign policy. He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.</p><p>But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.</p><p>Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting.

Everyone is belted in, including the dog. Now the adventure begins.</p><p>The road trip is a great American pastime. The slideshow of landscapes, from prairie to forest to city. The spontaneous stops for homemade pie or tacky souvenirs. The ocean air or evergreen scents wafting through the open windows (okay, it’s more likely asphalt).</p><p>Everything is going well — until it’s not. The driver is tired. The kids are fighting. Someone is asking for another bathroom break. Many of these incidents could be avoided, if only we all agreed on some ground rules.</p><p>So, we compiled 33 tips and tenets that will make sure every trip is epic, with smooth roads ahead and only the best memories in the rearview mirror.</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>1</p><p>Start with a clean car. While you are at it, check all the levels. Check your tire pressure. Change your windshield wipers if you know they’re on their last legs.</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>That little pine tree dangling from the mirror might look cute, but it’s a big no for road trip purposes. For the scent-sensitive, any kind of artificial smell could mean an instant headache and miserable drive.</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>3</p><p>Does someone want to nap while someone else drives, then switch places? Or does one driver want to power through all day? Whatever floats your boat. Just make sure everyone is on the same page from the get-go.</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>In the car, the seating order is determined by age — adults in the front, kiddos in the back — and height (long legs come with privileges). Youngest and smallest go in the middle seat.</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>5</p><p>Helmholtz Resonance is not the name of a cool new band. It’s the throbbing hum that occurs when you drive fast with the windows open. So shut ’em and crank up Social Distortion instead.</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>6</p><p>Check the route. Determine the best exits for meals, restrooms and any along-the-way sights ahead of time so you’re not making hangry decisions on the fly.</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>7</p><p>Around the time they get their license, every driver should have to acquaint themselves with a jack, a tire iron, lug nuts and little backup doughnut tires. They’ll come in handy one day.</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>8</p><p>Yes, the car has more storage than an overhead bin. But remember that the space in the back is not all yours. Keep a smaller bag with essentials close by so no one has to dig through the luggage mountain to get to your magazine.</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>9</p><p>What the driver says goes. There shall be no debate over music, temperature settings or wacky roadside attraction stops. Got a problem with that? Well, do you want to drive?</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>10</p><p>The driver has one job: to drive without distraction. Leave the auxiliary activities — navigation, Spotify playlists, Buc-ee’s mile countdowns — to the passengers. Absolutely no texting and driving. And no drinking (duh).</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>11</p><p>For the sake of your fellow passengers alone, take a deep breath. Somebody cut you off? Put “the bird” away and wish them a nice day.</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>12</p><p>You’re the driver’s right hand, the first level of defense against distraction and discomfort. This means you have to navigate, play DJ upon request, change the temperature and generally be an extra set of hands. Don’t be shocked if you’re asked to feed the driver a grape.</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>13</p><p>Sorry you get carsick, but if you’re about to hurl, you better say something. Make your condition known at the start of the trip, maybe sit shotgun if that helps, and stay! off! your! phone! If you do start to feel nauseous, give the driver a heads up ASAP so you can pull over before the point of no return.</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>14</p><p>Everyone must try to use the restroom at scheduled stops. If nature calls at other times, just say the word to be accommodated — but make sure to give fair warning.</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>15</p><p>You had your chance, so hold it and avoid looking at waterfalls.</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>16</p><p>Keep your opinions and shrieks to yourself. The driver is the boss here, remember?</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>17</p><p>You are not the only person cramped in this car. Resist the urge to ask “Are we there yet?”</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>18</p><p>In a perfect world, everyone would board the car with devices fully charged. But you should still pass the charging cable when someone’s phone needs a boost. If you’re the kind of person who gets nervous when your battery life dips below 50 percent, consider bringing your own portable charger on board.</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>19</p><p>The sun warming your head and the wind ruffling your hair might feel glorious to one traveler but torturous to another. All in favor of an open sunroof, say “aye.”</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>20</p><p>Yes, engage and entertain young passengers with all the I Spy games and “Wheels on the Bus” rounds you can handle. Pack knickknacks and crafts galore. But if all else fails, this is a fine time to let the kids watch “Bluey” to their hearts’ content.</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>21</p><p>It may be comfortable to stretch out. But resist the urge to rest those tootsies on the dash: If the air bag were to deploy, it could cause serious injuries. The folks over at MythBusters even used a crash dummy to illustrate the risk.</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>22</p><p>For your safety and your pet’s, the front seat — including your lap — should be a dog-free zone. Use a harness, travel carrier or car seat — with a booster if Buster is tiny.</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>23</p><p>There is a time and a place for Whoppers and Combos. This is it. Stock up accordingly, and bring enough to share.</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>24</p><p>Before you crack open the container of pickled eggs, ask yourself: is this snack going to stink up the car? Unless you have group consensus, save your fragrant food for pit stops. Here are some better options.</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>25</p><p>If you’re going to inflict fast food on your body, you better be sure it’s worth it. Don’t just take the first exit after your stomach grumbles. Know your personal junk food rankings, taking into account independent unicorns and regional chains. Nobody wants stale fries. But a Cook Out milkshake? Revelatory.</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>26</p><p>Formal table manners have no place inside a car. You have permission to eat all food groups with your hands and wipe your fingers on your pants.</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>27</p><p>These are precious real estate. If you have several beverages, you should stack, combine or chug them.</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>28</p><p>Don’t you dare chuck trash out the window. Circulate a communal trash bag and toss it (in a bin, please) whenever it reaches capacity.</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>29</p><p>This is not the time to live dangerously, Kramer! Don’t let your gas dip below a quarter tank, let alone push the limits of E.</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>30</p><p>It’s a dirty job, but someone’s got to do it. It would be nice if that someone weren’t the driver, who deserves a little break from responsibility.</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>31</p><p>The driver might not let you contribute, but it’s polite to offer. This applies to tolls and filling station snacks, too.</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>32</p><p>Yes, someone will pump your gas for you. No, do not tip. In the lone Full-Service State, the custom is to thank the gas station attendant with words not cash.</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>33</p><p>It’s your last act, so end the trip with a solid dismount. Park near the hotel, not in another Zip code. Find a real spot, not a gap in the bike lane. If you are still circling after 15 minutes, find a garage or drop off your passengers and the luggage. You better know how to parallel park.</p><p>About this story</p><p>Editing by Gabe Hiatt and Amanda Finnegan. Design editing by Christine Ashack. Design and development by Katty Huertas.

{"details":"<p>America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.</p><p>“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.</p><p>Even President Donald Trump, who just hours earlier had again publicly scolded the Ukrainian leadership for expressing what he regarded as insufficient gratitude, was now “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made,” Rubio added.</p><p>But the Secretary of State, who unexpectedly appeared in the briefing room alone, instead of being accompanied, as he had been earlier that day, by the powerful head of the Ukrainian delegation, Andriy Yermak, repeatedly refused to be drawn on the specifics of what had been achieved.</p><p>“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”</p><p>But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.</p><p>The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.</p><p>The US proposals seen by CNN suggest the area becomes a Russian demilitarized zone, which the Kremlin’s military forces would agree not to enter. But ordering the Ukrainian military to hand over land that its troops have fought and died to keep would be a hard sell.</p><p>Same too, the proposed limitation on Ukraine’s armed forces. Although set at a maximum of 600,000-strong in the US plan, European officials say they fear it would leave the country vulnerable to future attack.</p><p>But Washington, seemingly even more determined to force through a peace deal, has made it clear it expects Ukraine to comply, threatening to withdraw US military support for Kyiv and to essentially abandon the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – in the words of President Trump – “to fight his little heart out.”</p><p>In a statement on Sunday night from Washington, the White House said that the Ukrainians believe the latest draft of the peace proposals “reflects their national security interests,” after various revisions and clarifications made with input from top US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva.</p><p>“The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal concerns – security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty – were thoroughly addressed during the meeting,” the statement said.</p><p>The 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine, annotated</p><p>And it’s not just the White House that appears to be talking up the Geneva negotiations. Earlier, the Ukrainian delegation head Yermak, heaped praise on the talks, calling them “very productive.”</p><p>“We have had very good progress and we are moving forward to a just and lasting peace,” Yermak added, standing alongside Rubio in an earlier press briefing.</p><p>Even some Europeans – who had previously expressed concern at being sidelined at the talks in Geneva – seemed to praise their outcome. The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the talks produced a “decisive success” for Europe.</p><p>“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan,” Wadephul told the German Deutschlandfunk radio station.</p><p>There have been some words of caution, such as from the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart before commenting on X that “negotiations were a step forward but there are still major issues to be resolved.”</p><p>But even if the current draft US peace proposal, which Rubio called a changeable “living, breathing document” does indeed now work for the US, Ukraine and it’s European backers, it is very possible that it would no longer work for the Kremlin, which has consistently refused to back down from its maximalist demands.</p><p>And Moscow has so far faced limited US pressure to do so.</p><p>In Geneva, Rubio repeatedly side-stepped my attempts to ask him whether the US would also expect Russia, not just Ukraine, to make any significant concessions.</p><p>But if the White House is actually serious about achieving what it now calls “a durable, comprehensive peace” in Ukraine, somehow convincing the Kremlin to compromise may be its best bet.</p><p>This story has been updated with additional developments.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Slovenia’s move to legalise euthanasia comes as a growing number of countries favour reform.</p><p>By Alex Kozul-Wright and News Agencies</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Slovenia is voting on whether to legalise assisted dying for some terminally ill adults after other European countries have made the change.</p><p>The parliament of the small European Union nation passed a euthanasia bill in July, but a citizens initiative, led by right-wing politician Ales Primc, forced the referendum on Sunday.</p><p>The law will be rejected if at least 20 percent of participating voters oppose the bill. Slovenia has an electorate of 1.69 million people.</p><p>Supporters of the bill said it will alleviate unnecessary pain. Those against said society should care for the sick, not help them die.</p><p>Several European countries – including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland – already allow terminally ill people to receive medical help to end their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Under the disputed law, which was set to take effect this year, lucid but terminally ill patients would have had the right to die if their suffering had become unbearable and all other treatment options had been exhausted.</p><p>The legislation is similar to the assisted dying bill passed by the United Kingdom Parliament in June. Britain’s bill allows assisted suicide for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, the approvals of two doctors, judicial oversight and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>Slovenia’s law would require the approval of two doctors but also cooling-off periods and self-administration of the medication.</p><p>About 54 percent of citizens back the legalisation of assisted dying, almost 31 percent oppose it and 15 percent are undecided, according to a poll published this week by the Dnevnik daily based on 700 responses. In June 2024, 55 percent backed the law.</p><p>Prime Minister Robert Golob urged citizens to back the law “so that each of us can decide for ourselves how and with what dignity we will end our lives”.</p><p>Marijan Janzekovic, an 86-year-old who lives in the town of Sveti Tomaz near the capital, Ljubljana, also supports the bill.</p><p>His wife, Alenka Curin-Janzekovic, was in pain from diabetes-related illnesses before she ended her life at a suicide clinic in Switzerland in 2023.</p><p>“She was in a wheelchair … and in pain so bad my heart hurt just by watching her,” he told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The main political group opposing the law, called Voice for the Children and the Family, has accused the government of using the law to “poison” ill and elderly people.</p><p>Opponents said the law is inhumane and violates Slovenia’s Constitution, which declares human life inviolable.</p><p>Elsewhere, Slovenian Catholic Archbishop Stanislav Zore said the state should focus on palliative care instead.</p><p>“Let’s care for the sick and dying but not offer them suicide,” he said. The Catholic Church is opposed to euthanasia.</p><p>Assisted dying is already permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, several states in the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.</p><p>In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several US states, assisted dying laws are generally framed around medical aid. These jurisdictions typically require that patients be terminally ill, mentally competent and assessed by two independent doctors.</p><p>In many of these countries, the patient must self-administer lethal medication rather than have a doctor provide it directly. These regimes prioritise patient autonomy and strict procedural safeguards, such as waiting periods.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal, the approach to assisted dying is permissive. Active euthanasia or doctor-administered treatment is legal under defined conditions of unbearable suffering, even if the patient is not terminally ill.</p><p>In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, only assisted suicide is legally tolerated as opposed to active euthanasia. Switzerland is an outlier insofar as there is no dedicated regulatory regime for euthanasia, meaning nonresidents may access the service via organisations.</p><p>In May, France’s National Assembly approved a “right-to-die” bill. The legislation would allow adults over 18 who are citizens or residents and suffer from incurable illnesses and “intolerable” physical or psychological suffering to request lethal medication.</p><p>Under the bill, a medical team must assess the patient’s condition before a mandatory reflection period before the prescription of a lethal substance. If the patient is physically unable to self-administer, a doctor or nurse may assist.</p><p>The proposal excludes people with severe psychiatric conditions or neurodegenerative disorders like advanced Alzheimer’s disease. The bill now has to go to the Senate and must return to the National Assembly for a second reading before it could become law.</p><p>Elsewhere, Britain’s lower house voted to legalise assisted dying in June. The House of Commons narrowly voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, marking a major step towards legalising assisted dying in England and Wales.</p><p>The bill would allow mentally competent adults with a prognosis of less than six months to live to request medical help to end their lives, subject to assessments by two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a social worker.</p><p>The legislation is not yet law. It must still get through the House of Lords, where it will be further scrutinised and may be amended.

{"details":"<p>Islamabad balances alliances, economic needs and public sentiment as it weighs potential troop deployment to Gaza.</p><p>By Abid Hussain</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>Islamabad, Pakistan – When the United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a United States-authored resolution that paves the way for a transitional administration and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, Pakistan – which was presiding over the council – had a seemingly contradictory response.</p><p>Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, thanked the US for tabling the resolution and voted in its favour. But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.</p><p>Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the mandate of the ISF.</p><p>“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.</p><p>But the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.</p><p>The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.</p><p>“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”</p><p>In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.</p><p>Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.</p><p>Pakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.</p><p>In September, Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.</p><p>By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it shot down Indian jets, Munir met Trump in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.</p><p>In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s rare earth minerals.</p><p>Now, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”</p><p>That’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.</p><p>Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.</p><p>That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.</p><p>Officially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.</p><p>Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.</p><p>“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.</p><p>In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.</p><p>“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.</p><p>Some retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.</p><p>Muhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.</p><p>“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.</p><p>Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.</p><p>Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.</p><p>The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.</p><p>Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.</p><p>So far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.</p><p>US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.</p><p>King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.</p><p>Bokhari argued Pakistan has limited options, adding that many of its close allies are “deeply committed” to the initiative and have sought Islamabad’s participation.</p><p>“Pakistan’s economic and financial problems mean it will need to reciprocate militarily in order to secure” the goodwill of the US and Islamabad’s Gulf allies, he said. “We have to assume that the current civilian-military leadership is aware of the domestic political risks.”</p><p>Others point to Pakistan’s long experience with UN peacekeeping. As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.</p><p>Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.</p><p>Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.</p><p>“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.</p><p>“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.</p><p>Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.</p><p>Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.</p><p>Still, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.</p><p>Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.</p><p>“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.</p><p>Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.</p><p>“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.</p><p>But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.</p><p>Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.</p><p>“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Follow Al Jazeera English:</p>","headline":"Can Pakistan join the Gaza stabilisation force without facing backlash?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-21T18:30:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Test your eye for visual effects. What’s real and what’s not might surprise you.</p><p>In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.</p><p>But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.</p><p>“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”</p><p>Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.</p><p>To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>2. Production</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.</p><p>“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.</p><p>Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.</p><p>“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”</p><p>Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.</p><p>But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)</p><p>Take a look below at how “Severance” planned out its Season 2 opening using rough 3D models.</p><p>An animatic, or basic animation with simple, undetailed 3D models, helped the “Severance” crew plan the exact cadence, camera angles and more.</p><p></p><p>In this first shot, a Bolt motion camera uses a robotic arm for rapid back-and-forth shots.</p><p>Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-</p><p>generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.</p><p>The visual effects team also coordinates with other departments to ensure production goes smoothly.</p><p>“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.</p><p>The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”</p><p>Case in point: “Wicked” used exclusively blue screens because of how prominent green in the story, including Elphaba’s skin, the Emerald City and guard uniforms. And certain scenes required a scale that was unrealistic to build. So instead, production design built interior sets up to 25 feet and exterior sets up to 55 feet. Visual effects took care of the rest.</p><p>“Filmmaking is one of the those disciplines where everything is done through collaborating with each other,” said Helman. “There are about 1,000 people just on visual effects” for the “Wicked” films, he said. He added, “We all put a little bit into the creative process so that the movie has texture and has layers.”</p><p>2. Production</p><p>Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>3.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.</p><p>“Maybe it was this perfect shot of the sunset, and my two leads were finally getting together. And a car drove by in the background that no one knew about,” said ILM’s Eric Leven, the visual effects supervisor for Season 2 of “Severance.”</p><p>Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.</p><p>That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.</p><p>Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.</p><p>Early, simple 3D models can also help directors and actors in the shooting process. James Cameron’s Avatar films, which feature the blue alien species called Na’vi, heavily relied on a depth compositing tool that rendered those aliens, CGI objects and environments in real time on the camera screen as filming took place.</p><p>“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”</p><p>The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.</p><p>This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.</p><p>“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.</p><p>The “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage. This allows James Cameron to walk through an empty set but see things as if he were filming in</p><p>real time.</p><p>How the “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

{"details":"<p>Test your eye for visual effects. What’s real and what’s not might surprise you.</p><p>In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.</p><p>But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.</p><p>“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”</p><p>Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.</p><p>To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>2. Production</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.</p><p>“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.</p><p>Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.</p><p>“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”</p><p>Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.</p><p>But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)</p><p>Take a look below at how “Severance” planned out its Season 2 opening using rough 3D models.</p><p>An animatic, or basic animation with simple, undetailed 3D models, helped the “Severance” crew plan the exact cadence, camera angles and more.</p><p></p><p>In this first shot, a Bolt motion camera uses a robotic arm for rapid back-and-forth shots.</p><p>Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-</p><p>generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.</p><p>The visual effects team also coordinates with other departments to ensure production goes smoothly.</p><p>“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.</p><p>The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”</p><p>Case in point: “Wicked” used exclusively blue screens because of how prominent green in the story, including Elphaba’s skin, the Emerald City and guard uniforms. And certain scenes required a scale that was unrealistic to build. So instead, production design built interior sets up to 25 feet and exterior sets up to 55 feet. Visual effects took care of the rest.</p><p>“Filmmaking is one of the those disciplines where everything is done through collaborating with each other,” said Helman. “There are about 1,000 people just on visual effects” for the “Wicked” films, he said. He added, “We all put a little bit into the creative process so that the movie has texture and has layers.”</p><p>2. Production</p><p>Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>3.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.</p><p>“Maybe it was this perfect shot of the sunset, and my two leads were finally getting together. And a car drove by in the background that no one knew about,” said ILM’s Eric Leven, the visual effects supervisor for Season 2 of “Severance.”</p><p>Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.</p><p>That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.</p><p>Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.</p><p>Early, simple 3D models can also help directors and actors in the shooting process. James Cameron’s Avatar films, which feature the blue alien species called Na’vi, heavily relied on a depth compositing tool that rendered those aliens, CGI objects and environments in real time on the camera screen as filming took place.</p><p>“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”</p><p>The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.</p><p>This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.</p><p>“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.</p><p>The “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage. This allows James Cameron to walk through an empty set but see things as if he were filming in</p><p>real time.</p><p>How the “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

{"details":"<p>• US Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted “tremendous progress” in today’s talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, saying the sticking points on the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine peace proposal are “not insurmountable.” Ukraine has also said the delegations made good progress.</p><p>• It remains to be seen if Moscow would sign on to the terms being hammered out between Washington and Kyiv. Trump’s original 28-point peace plan had been widely considered favorable to Russia and was met with concern from European allies.</p><p>• Even as the talks progressed, President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukraine’s leaders this morning, claiming they have “expressed zero gratitude” for his efforts to end the war. Ukraine’s president has repeatedly thanked the US publicly. Rubio later signaled that those tensions had been smoothed over and said Trump is “pleased” with the progress.</p><p>Our live coverage has ended. Get the latest here.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has departed Geneva, Switzerland, and is heading back to Washington, DC, following high-level meetings on a peace plan for Ukraine, a senior State Department official said today.</p><p>Rubio indicated that discussions would continue on a technical level as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”</p><p>It’s not clear whether other US officials have left Geneva, though Rubio said earlier that “we have all kinds of people at technical levels that are working full time on this and engaged in this full time.”</p><p>Earlier today, Rubio heralded “tremendous progress” following meetings with Ukrainian officials to end the war, calling the discussions “the most productive day in the entirety of our efforts.”</p><p>The final agreement, he noted, will require sign-off from US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia will also need to sign off on the plan.</p><p>The White House said today that the Ukrainians believe the current draft of a peace plan to end the war “reflects their national security interests,” after “revisions and clarifications” were made with input from top US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>A draft 28-point plan had faced criticism for appearing to favor Russia. But the White House said in a statement today that Ukraine’s key concerns were “thoroughly addressed” and “today marked a significant step forward.”</p><p>“The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting,” the statement said.</p><p></p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had praised the “substantive” results from the meeting. “Much is changing: We are working very carefully on the steps needed to end the war,” he said in a video address posted on Telegram.</p><p>Separately, Ukraine also expressed its gratitude toward the US and President Donald Trump in a joint statement released by the White House.</p><p>“The Ukrainian delegation reaffirmed its gratitude for the steadfast commitment of the United States and, personally, President Donald J. Trump for their tireless efforts aimed at ending the war and the loss of life,” the statement said.</p><p></p><p>Just this morning, Trump lashed out at Ukrainian leadership for what he called a lack of gratitude, and it seems the Ukrainians have responded, in kind, with several mentions of thanks to the US and Trump.</p><p>Zelensky posted on X that “Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump” for assistance that has saved Ukrainian lives.</p><p>Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak told reporters, “We thank our big friends, United States, and personally President Trump and his team to their commitment to bring this peace.”</p><p>The draft of the Trump administration’s 28-point Ukraine peace plan that has been viewed publicly amounts to a surrender, Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today.</p><p>“My thoughts is that this is not a peace plan, it’s a surrender plan,” Meeks told CNN’s Jessica Dean.</p><p></p><p>The New York Democrat accused the Trump administration of essentially giving “Russia more than Russia would’ve asked for.” Meanwhile, Moscow will give up “absolutely nothing,” he claimed.</p><p>Meeks said the deal sends the wrong message to European allies.</p><p>“If we do this to Ukraine, then what does that mean for the rest of NATO? Because that means Putin can continue to go wherever he wants, knowing that the United States of America may not have their back,” he said.</p><p></p><p>Key context: The original draft of the Trump administration’s proposal has been widely criticized for being too favorable to Russia, as it would concede many long-standing Kremlin demands.</p><p>After talks in Geneva today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed that the proposal is a “living, breathing document” that is shifting in response to input from Ukraine and other parties. Rubio said “the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” and the Ukrainian delegation also emerged from the talks with a positive assessment.</p><p>The current outline of the proposal — and whether it’s one Moscow would ever sign on to — remains to be seen.</p><p>Watch the interview with Meeks:</p><p>CNN’s Kit Maher, Svitlana Vlasova and Mitchell McCluskey contributed to this post.</p><p>Top US diplomats and Ukrainian officials are expressing optimism after holding talks in Geneva today, though it remains to be seen if Moscow would sign on to the terms the two sides have been discussing.</p><p>The positive messaging came despite President Donald Trump lashing out at Kyiv’s leaders this morning, claiming they have “expressed zero gratitude” for his efforts to end the war with Russia, despite many examples to the contrary.</p><p>If you’re just joining us, here’s the latest on the talks and potential peace plan:</p><p>CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova, Mitchell McCluskey, Kit Maher, Nina Subkhanberdina and Betsy Klein contributed to this post.</p><p>Europe’s E3 powers of Britain, France and Germany created a counter-proposal to the United States’ 28-point Ukraine peace plan, according to Reuters, which saw the text on Sunday.</p><p>The text was confirmed as accurate by one European official and one European diplomatic source speaking to CNN’s chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>One of those officials said the text was an accurate reflection of European bids to change the US draft proposal, but that further alterations could have been made during fast-moving talks in Geneva today.</p><p>Here’s how the plan differs: Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was a softening of the language around restricting NATO in Europe.</p><p>The European version also removed mention of territorial concessions. The regions of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk were all explicitly recognized as de facto Russian in the US plan. In the new European proposal, all recognitions of Russian control are removed. It demands a ceasefire before determining territorial swaps, and that the current front line be the basis for any future discussions.</p><p>The Europeans also removed the 100-day deadline for elections in Ukraine, instead saying elections will be held as soon as possible after the signing of the peace agreement.</p><p>The European proposal removes all references to US-Russia investment structures, shifting toward an approach where Russia pays reparations to Ukraine.</p><p>It also said the size of Ukraine’s military would be “capped at 800,000 in peacetime,” which is the amount of military personnel it currently has, compared to limit of 600,000 stated in the US-plan.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the “substantive” results from diplomatic discussions held today in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Much is changing: We are working very carefully on the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel this evening.</p><p>As the delegates headed into today’s talks, US President Donald Trump had accused the Ukrainians of showing insufficient gratitude for US efforts — echoing a past criticism that’s at odds with Kyiv’s public record of thanking US leaders.</p><p>But Zelensky said “there are signs that President Trump’s team is listening” to their side.</p><p>“Diplomacy has been activated, which is good,” Zelensky said. “The first priority is reliable peace, guaranteed security, respect for our people, respect for everyone who gave their lives defending Ukraine from Russian aggression.”</p><p></p><p>He also urged Ukrainians not to send “conflicting signals” and to maintain unity in their messaging.</p><p>The Ukrainian president held discussions with several world leaders today, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and the prime ministers of Canada, Croatia and Luxembourg.</p><p>You can watch a portion of Zelensky’s comments below:</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated Sunday that the Thursday deadline set by President Donald Trump for Ukraine to accept the United States’ peace proposal is fluid.</p><p>“The deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible. Obviously, you know, we would love it to be Thursday. … We’ve really moved forward, so I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon,” Rubio said in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p></p><p>“Whether it’s Thursday, whether it’s Friday, whether it’s Wednesday, whether it’s Monday of the following week, we want it to be soon, because people are going to die,” Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio said the US recognizes that Ukraine needs to have security guarantees as part of a peace proposal, but he did not delve into specifics of what was discussed.</p><p>“I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel as it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again,” Rubio said.</p><p>While Rubio said it’s “possible” a call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky could occur later, he said was unsure.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the 28-point peace plan for the end of the war in Ukraine continues to change with input from the parties involved, calling the moment “very delicate.”</p><p>“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” Rubio said, later adding: “I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today.”</p><p></p><p>Russia was not involved in Sunday’s talks in Geneva, Switzerland, between the US and Ukraine.</p><p>Rubio declined to get into the specifics when pressed by CNN’s Matthew Chance on whether the Ukrainians have indicated they are prepared to compromise, given that it’s “an ongoing process.”</p><p>“Just because it’s printed on a piece of paper doesn’t indicate finality, so you get input, and based on that input, you make adjustments and then you get more input,” Rubio said.</p><p>Rubio noted that “the Russians get a vote here” and will be consulted in the next step toward peace.</p><p>“Obviously, we now have to take what we come up with — if we can reach that agreement with the Ukrainian side — to the Russian side,” he said.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Sunday that he conveyed to President Donald Trump that talks with Ukrainian officials were “very positive” and that the president is “pleased” with the progress.</p><p>“It was very positive — I’m telling you today was the most productive,” Rubio said upon conclusion of Sunday’s discussions in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Pressed by CNN’s Matthew Chance on Trump’s comments earlier in the day lashing out at Ukraine for what the president described as a lack of gratitude, Rubio signaled those tensions had been smoothed over.</p><p>Trump said in a social media post earlier that “Ukraine’s ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts.”</p><p>Rubio said he had subsequently spoken with the president.</p><p>“Today — and we’ve talked to him since — I think he’s quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made,” he said.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio heralded “tremendous progress” following diplomatic talks with Ukrainian officials to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, calling Sunday’s discussions “the most productive day in the entirety of our efforts.”</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, Rubio touted “extensive engagement” from Ukraine on the US-backed 28-point peace plan, which is widely considered favorable to Russia.</p><p>Going into the talks, he said, there was “one goal” — to “try to narrow” the disagreements around key points.</p><p>“We have achieved that today in a very substantial way,” Rubio said.</p><p>The final agreement, he noted, will require sign-off from US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia will also need to sign off on the plan to end the nearly four-year war.</p><p>There are still some sticking points, Rubio said, characterizing the outstanding issues as “a couple issues that we need to continue to work on.”</p><p>“I don’t want to declare victory or finality here. There’s still some work to be done, but we are much further ahead today, at this time, than we were when we began this morning,” he said.</p><p></p><p>We heard from both the US and Ukrainian delegations after the early session of talks in Geneva, with each side projecting optimism.</p><p>In case you missed it, here’s US Secretary of State Marco Rubio first. Rubio described the meeting as the “most productive and meaningful” so far:</p><p>And here’s Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian presidential office, who also said the sides were making progress today:</p><p>We may hear more from the two sides this evening, and we’ll have updates for you as we learn more.</p><p>President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is part of the US delegation meeting with Ukrainian officials in Geneva.</p><p>Kushner has played a key role at times in US diplomacy in the Middle East and elsewhere during Trump’s first and second term.</p><p>The Trump administration has been rushing to move forward a deal to end the war in Ukraine in the weeks since a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which Kushner also helped broker.</p><p>The delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Other members include special envoy Steve Witkoff, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, State Department counselor Mike Needham, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Alexis Grynkewich, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, and the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Julie Davis.</p><p>It’s been a rollercoaster 24 hours — with confusion and uncertainty among Ukrainian and European diplomats on whether Washington’s 28-point peace plan was final or marked the basis for further negotiation.</p><p>Earlier in the day, when I asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio whether the US would turn its back on Ukraine if it rejected the peace proposal, Rubio stormed past, stony-faced.</p><p>Hours later, he came out to speak to the press — alongside Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak — and seemed more upbeat. Both Rubio and Yermak were speaking of progress and appeared to be in a positive frame of mind.</p><p>Intensive face-to-face negotiations are now continuing into the evening here in Geneva with US and Ukrainian officials indicating they may have more to say on the outcome of the talks later tonight.</p><p>But the big question remains whether the process underway right now may be the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine or yet another performative dead end.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his call for a strong and lasting peace as US and Ukrainian delegations hold talks in Geneva.</p><p>Zelensky said the “crux of the entire diplomatic situation” is that Russia has refused to end its invasion.</p><p>“Putin has been waging this war with complete disregard for how many of his own people he loses and how many of ours he kills,” Zelensky wrote in an X post today.</p><p>The Ukrainian leader said he was grateful to President Donald Trump and European leaders for engaging in discussions about the US-proposed peace deal. His comments come after Trump accused Ukraine’s leaders of showing “zero gratitude” for US assistance, despite Zelensky and others repeatedly thanking the president publicly.</p><p>“It is important not to forget the main goal — to stop Russia’s war and prevent it from ever igniting again. And to achieve that, peace must be dignified,” Zelensky said. “That is why we work so carefully on every point, on every step toward peace. Everything must work out the right way — so that this war is truly ended and so that it does not happen again.”</p><p></p><p>Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she was mostly concerned with the use of the US military on domestic soil when she recently taped a video alongside fellow Democrats advising service members to refuse illegal orders the Trump administration might issue.</p><p>“My primary concern is the use of US military on American shores, on our city, in our cities and in our streets,” Slotkin said today on ABC’s “This Week.”</p><p></p><p>Slotkin advised service members to speak to their judge advocate general officers to “ask them for explanation, for top cover, for their view on things.”</p><p>“It is very clear that no one should follow an illegal order, but it’s very murky when you look at, what is an illegal order, and if you go into morally, ethically, that’s a pretty tough thing to look at and say, ‘How do I navigate this?’” she added.</p><p>President Donald Trump reacted furiously to the video last week, suggesting the lawmakers’ actions were, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”</p><p>Slotkin criticized Trump’s response, though she said it won’t prevent her from continuing to speak her mind. “But obviously the president took issue with one sentence in a video and was calling for our death. I think that’s inappropriate,” Slotkin said.</p><p>While the president’s call to arrest the lawmakers — which he doubled down on today — has been roundly criticized by Democrats, the remarks have also attracted some rare criticism from Republicans.</p><p>GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky rebuked Trump’s rhetoric toward the six Democrats today, calling the president’s behavior “reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible” in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”</p><p>Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian president’s office, said the Ukrainian delegation had “a very productive first session” with US officials in Geneva today, as talks continue to bring an end to the war with Russia.</p><p>“We have very good progress, and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace. Ukrainian people deserve and want this peace more than anyone in this planet,” Yermak said alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also shared an upbeat assessment.</p><p></p><p>President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian leadership on social media this morning for what he described as a lack of gratitude. In his remarks to reporters, Yermak thanked the US president: “We thank our big friends, United States, and personally President Trump and his team for their commitment to bring this peace.”</p><p>It marked another example of the many times Ukrainian officials have publicly expressed appreciation for the administration.</p><p>Yermak said the group would continue working today and join proposals in the coming days.</p><p>“We also will engage our European friends, and of course, the final words will be of our leaders, of the President of United States and Ukraine, and I hope that we can achieve the good progress today,” Yermak said.</p><p></p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism after what he described as productive discussions between the US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva today.</p><p>“It is my personal view that we’ve had probably the most productive and meaningful meeting so far in this entire process since we’ve been involved,” Rubio told reporters in Switzerland a short time ago.</p><p></p><p>Rubio described the administration’s 28-point peace plan, which has been criticized on both sides of the aisle for its concessions to Russia, as a “very good work product,” and said it was “built on a foundation of input from all the relevant parties involved here.”</p><p>According to a draft, its provisions would include Kyiv ceding territory to Russia, giving up any ambitions to join NATO, and limiting the size of its army.</p><p>US and Ukrainian officials, Rubio said, are now meeting separately to work through some adjustments to the plan, with the hopes “of further narrowing the differences.”</p><p>Ultimately, he added, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will need to approve the plan. Rubio said he felt “very comfortable about that happening, given the progress we’ve made.”</p><p>Russia will also need to sign off on the plan.</p><p>Rubio said there would be additional updates later today.</p><p>The US says talks with Ukraine today in Geneva have been “productive and even conclusive in some areas” as they discussed President Donald Trump’s 28-point proposal to end the war with Russia.</p><p>“As the day progressed, the Ukrainians and US delegation got together to have detailed discussions about the peace agreement,” a US official said. “There’s a formal meeting between the two delegations where they will be ironing out the details of the agreement,” they added.</p><p></p><p>The US-backed proposal has come under fire from critics who say it is too friendly to Russia.</p><p>While it’s important for Ukraine to iron out its differences with the US, the ultimate test will be if it can come to an agreement with Moscow.</p><p>While we await further updates on the Russia-Ukraine talks in Geneva, let’s update you on some of the other stories we’ve been reporting from Washington in the last 24 hours.</p><p>CNN’s Ali Main, Manu Raju, Auzinea Bacon, Natasha Bertrand, Avery Schmitz and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>One Monday in mid-October, after a year in US immigration detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.</p><p>They told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.</p><p>Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.</p><p>When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.</p><p>Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.</p><p>Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p>A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, which was a central plank of Trump's winning re-election campaign, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers.</p><p>In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.</p><p>Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.</p><p>Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.</p><p>\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"</p><p>For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.</p><p>Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.</p><p>Converts from Islam make up a significant share of Iran's estimated 800,000 Christian population, says Steve Dew-Jones of Article 18, a UK-based advocacy group that monitors violations against Christians in the country.</p><p>With officially recognised churches tightly restricted, house churches have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.</p><p>Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.</p><p>Arrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.</p><p>Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.</p><p>But it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.</p><p>\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"</p><p>Asylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.</p><p>In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.</p><p>After their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"</p><p>Pastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.</p><p>He says they entered legally through a humanitarian programme and had work authorisations. \"How can it be dangerous for the wife but not for the husband?\" asks pastor, Ara Torosian, who himself fled Iran in 2010 after being detained for smuggling Bibles.</p><p>Majid, who managed to slip through the airport in Turkey, has been living in limbo since, while his lawyer follows up on his case. His wife, whose asylum case is still pending, now lives in Los Angeles with their 1.5-year-old daughter - a child who has never met her father.</p><p>In the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.</p><p>\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran? If they deport me, I could go to prison the moment I land.\"</p><p>Unable to work legally or open a bank account. He first stayed with a distant relative \"just until my wife's case was resolved,\" but she was never released and, after nearly a year in detention, was deported. A small church later offered him temporary shelter.</p><p>\"Anytime they ask me to leave, I have to sleep in parks,\" he says.</p><p>He is awaiting an immigration hearing but sees no good outcome. His wife has received another summons from Iranian intelligence.</p><p>\"If they arrest her and demand I return,\" he says quietly, \"I'll have no choice.\"</p><p>Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.</p><p>According to the United States Geological Survey, this is the 37th eruption episode since December 2024.</p><p>Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, says she was diagnosed shortly after giving birth in 2024 and has less than a year to live.</p><p>The Church of England is grappling with what to do about followers of the far-right figure embracing faith.</p><p>While the US escalates a military threat in nearby waters, Venezuelans say the real enemy of the people is a sharp rise in food prices.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Dharmendra, one of Indian cinema’s most popular stars, whose versatile performances made him a defining screen presence of 1970s and 1980s Bollywood films, died Monday. He was 89.</p><p>The actor, who would have turned 90 on December 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.</p><p>A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra’s doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor’s death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.</p><p>“He was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,” Modi said on social media platform X.</p><p>Often called Bollywood’s “He-Man,” Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India’s most iconic actors.</p><p>Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero — upright, patriotic and fearless — his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.</p><p>Dharmendra’s performance in “Sholay” (1975) — Bollywood’s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India’s greatest films — earned him enduring popularity.</p><p>His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy “Chupke Chupke” (1975) to the action drama “Mera Gaon Mera Desh” (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.</p><p>His role in Bollywood classic “Sholay,” where he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo’s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood’s most iconic pairings.</p><p>His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood’s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films.</p><p>A ‘tidal change’ in Bollywood: How the world’s largest film industry veered to the right during the Modi era</p><p>But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps — Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.</p><p>Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her.</p><p>According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.</p><p>Dharmendra and Malini had two daughters, including Bollywood actor Esha Deol.

She made frequent trips to Washington DC, where she would berate Democratic members of Congress for what she said were their socialist and pro-Islam policies.</p><p>She promoted baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, questioning whether shootings in a US school were \"staged\" and alleging that the Democratic party was secretly run by a group of powerful paedophiles.</p><p>Once in Congress, she clashed with Democrats - and members of her own party. Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the House voted to remove her from her committee assignments shortly after she took office.</p><p>When Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson, and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well.</p><p>In 2023, she was expelled from the conservative House Freedom Caucus.</p><p>She had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington.</p><p>And then she didn't.</p><p>In a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene's departure from Congress was \"great news for the country\".</p><p>He would later post on Truth Social that Greene \"went bad\" but that he would \"always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to our country\".</p><p>Greene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a \"new path ahead\". Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state's governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.</p><p>Her decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without Trump's support.</p><p>The move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never appear on a presidential ballot again.</p><p>At 51, Greene's tenure in Congress may be at an end, but her involvement in American political life may be far from over.</p><p>Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.</p><p>According to the United States Geological Survey, this is the 37th eruption episode since December 2024.</p><p>Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, says she was diagnosed shortly after giving birth in 2024 and has less than a year to live.</p><p>While the US escalates a military threat in nearby waters, Venezuelans say the real enemy of the people is a sharp rise in food prices.</p><p>US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>A 21-year-old Ukrainian sumo wrestler who fled the Russian invasion has won an elite-level sumo competition in Japan, where he’s been lauded for his rapid rise in the hyper-competitive sport.</p><p>Yavhusishyn Danylo, known by his ring name Aonishiki, emerged victorious from the November Grand Sumo Tournament on Sunday, according to national broadcaster NHK. In the deciding match, he defeated Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, a top-ranked wrestler.</p><p>“It’s a feeling that words can’t express,” Aonishiki said after his win, according to NHK. “It felt like I was just letting my body do its thing, using my own strength. I’ve been diligently doing what my master told me, and it led to this result.”</p><p>His win caps a meteoric rise within the sport, dictated by ritual and tradition, in the three years since the 21-year-old arrived in Japan as war ravaged his home country.</p><p>He had started with wrestling and judo as a child in Ukraine, where martial arts have long been popular; the country boasts a long list of Olympic medal-winning wrestlers. At seven years old, he switched to sumo after seeing sumo athletes training at his judo facility, according to CNN affiliate Asahi Shimbun.</p><p>He quickly demonstrated a talent for the sport, placing third at the junior world sumo championships in Japan at just 15 years old – which is where he befriended Japanese sumo wrestler Arata Yamanaka.</p><p>Then, that all shuddered to a halt in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Wrestling facilities were destroyed, and athletes and their families fled abroad – including Aonishiki, whose family moved to Germany.</p><p>“I thought it would be a shame to end my sports career there,” Aonishiki told NHK in a documentary about his journey that aired in July. “I liked sumo, I felt I should try to compete in sumo somehow on the path I’d chosen.”</p><p>So, at 18 years old, he came alone to Japan – where his friend Yamanaka, at the time captain of the sumo club at Kansai University, offered to house Aonishiki at his family home and arranged for the Ukrainian to train at the university club.</p><p>His ring name translates to “blue” – one of the colors of the Ukrainian flag.</p><p>Aonishiki began rebuilding his career in a new country and a new language. Soon, he became fluent in Japanese and climbed the ranks at record speed – defeating his fellow university wrestlers despite not being the largest or heaviest (at only 140 kilograms, or 308 pounds – lower than average for top-division sumo wrestlers).</p><p>He eventually joined the Tokyo-based Ajigawa stable to live, train and compete professionally. By Sunday’s tournament, he had reached the third-highest rank of Sekiwake after competing in just 13 tournaments, a record pace in a sport where rankings often fluctuate, and wrestlers can be promoted or demoted depending on their competition performance.</p><p>After Aonishiki’s win on Sunday, the national sumo governing body held an extraordinary meeting to discuss his potential promotion to the second-highest title of Ozeki, according to NHK.</p><p>But the Ukrainian wrestler wants to go one better. “There’s one more rank above this, so I want to aim for that,” he said, with his eyes firmly on the top title of Yokozuna.</p><p>CNN’s Junko Ogura contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord have recently introduced age checks on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban.</p><p>The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p>These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p>YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.</p><p>Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.</p><p>The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.</p><p>Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.</p><p>The government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.</p><p>Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has announced it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said.</p><p>Snapchat has said users can use bank accounts or photo IDs to verify their age or take a selfie, which will be used to estimate their age.</p><p>The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.</p><p>Without a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.</p><p>The government's own report found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.</p><p>Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".</p><p>Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.</p><p>Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.</p><p>Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\".</p><p>\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"</p><p>Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages.</p><p>Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.</p><p>But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches.</p><p>It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p><p>Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy.</p><p>They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.</p><p>YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.</p><p>Even as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\".</p><p>At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it.</p><p>Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.</p><p>The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p>In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p>Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a French parliamentary enquiry recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p>Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p>Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p><p>Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p>Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p>Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules.</p><p>Skye Gyngell, a former private chef to Nigella Lawson and Madonna, was diagnosed with skin cancer last year.</p><p>A Manchester nightclub that enforced a strict no-mobile phone policy puts out a reminder of the rules.</p><p>England fans \"should be better than\" the \"abuse\" they direct at Australia batter Steve Smith, says former coach Darren Lehmann.</p><p>Disgruntled England fans in Perth watch the Lions instead of day three of the First Test.

{"details":"<p>A sense of anxiety grips Rangpuri Pahari, a slum in India's capital Delhi.</p><p>The neighbourhood houses thousands of migrant workers who have lived hand-to-mouth for decades, mostly employed in the unorganised sector as domestic staff, cooks, mechanics, car washers and construction labourers.</p><p>Now they fear they'll have to make sudden - and costly - trips home to keep their names on India's electoral rolls.</p><p>On 4 November, India began a major exercise to revise electoral rolls across 12 states and federally administered regions.</p><p>Known as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), it covers nearly 510 million voters - or more than half of the country's 970 million electorate.</p><p>India's Election Commission (EC) says the aim of the exercise is to ensure that no eligible voter is excluded and no ineligible name remains on the rolls. A similar controversial exercise was carried out in India's Bihar state recently.</p><p>As part of this exercise, polling booth-level officers visit households across towns and villages, collecting personal identity details and voter card numbers.</p><p>For most migrant workers, an unplanned trip home means extra costs and lost wages.</p><p>\"My employers approve time off only during elections and festivals. If I take leave now, I will lose my salary. I can't afford that. And someone else could replace me,\" Anjali Mondol, who works as a domestic help, told the BBC.</p><p>Similar concerns were echoed by others in the slum. Subhashri Doloi, also a domestic worker, says: \"I was saving money to travel home in a few months to cast my vote. But if I use that money now, how will I go again during the election?\"</p><p>Some worry about the gaps in their official documents - a common problem across India, especially in rural areas.</p><p>Kusum Devi, who works in a garment factory in Delhi, is a registered voter in her village in Uttar Pradesh - one of the states where the SIR is ongoing. But her Aadhaar, a national unique identification number, shows her as a resident of Delhi.</p><p>\"There has been no problem so far, but I don't know what will happen now,\" she says.</p><p>Workers also worry that the SIR could affect their access to welfare schemes. For those from West Bengal (another state where SIR is ongoing), which borders Bangladesh, there is an added fear of being asked to prove their citizenship.</p><p>Crackdowns on alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are not new in India. In recent months, hundreds of people have been arrested on suspicion of being illegal migrants.</p><p>\"Nobody wants to be wrongfully branded as Bangladeshi,\" said Yaser Ali from West Bengal, who sells utensils. \"If this [SIR] helps us, we want to make sure that it is done right. But how do we do it on such short notice?\"</p><p>Under the guidelines, there is a provision to fill the SIR form online but most migrant workers the BBC spoke to said they were either unfamiliar with the process or found it \"too risky\".</p><p>The EC has dismissed these concerns, saying the process is being carried out in the most transparent manner.</p><p>In a statement shared with the BBC, the poll panel urged voters to opt for online verification, saying the option has been introduced especially \"for the convenience of those electors who are currently not at their place of residence\".</p><p>The physical forms, on the other hand, can be filled up by the electors themselves or \"any adult family member\", by mentioning their relationship with the elector, and handed over to the booth-level officers, it said.</p><p>The EC added that it will ensure that \"sufficient opportunity and time is given to the electors for filing claims and objections\".</p><p>For the SIR, electoral rolls from 2002 to 2004 are being used as reference.</p><p>People whose names do not appear in those lists must produce one additional document - such as their birth or caste certificates, passports, school records, post-office papers and bank documents - to be able to enrol.</p><p>Those who became eligible voters or were born after the reference year must also show supporting documents for one or both their parents.</p><p>However, an order by the EC issued on 27 October says, \"No document is to be collected from electors during the enumeration phase\" - without giving any more details.</p><p>Some workers are hopeful. Ramdhin Prajapati, a factory worker who votes in Uttar Pradesh, says he sees SIR as a \"one-time effort\" he is willing to make.</p><p>Uttar Pradesh will not go to the polls before 2027 and Mr Prajapati feels there will be enough time to make corrections if things go wrong.</p><p>But that's not the case for workers from West Bengal, where elections are a few months away.</p><p>\"There is hardly any time,\" says Uma Muniam, who works as a cook in Delhi. \"There are millions of migrants like me spread across India. Will they be able to travel twice in four months - once for SIR and again for election?\"</p><p>Rajesh Kumar, a Delhi-based trade unionist, says the poll panel needs to do more to create awareness about the process. \"Most migrant workers lack job security and the SIR exercise is causing them stress,\" he said.</p><p>According to India's 2011 census, the most recent count, the country has around 139 million migrant workers, although the actual numbers are believed to be much higher.</p><p>\"It would be useful if help desks were set up in big cities to assist these workers,\" Mr Kumar says.</p><p>Back in Rangpuri Pahari, some neighbours had gathered at Rajendranath Mallick's home last week.</p><p>Mr Mallick, one of the few migrants travelling to his West Bengal village for the SIR, has become a go-to figure in the slum, fielding constant questions. Some want him to fill out their forms once he reaches home; others, who've already sent papers to relatives, want him to check if the process has gone through.</p><p>Mr Mallick's feedback will help his neighbours decide whether, and when, they need to make the journey themselves.</p><p>Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>With many families left traumatised by killings apparently linked to supposed  magic rituals in Sierra Leone, BBC Africa Eye looks into those behind the trade in human body parts.</p><p>Warning: This article contains details some readers may find disturbing.</p><p>The mother of an 11-year-old boy murdered as part of a suspected black magic killing four years ago is devastated that no-one has yet been brought to justice for his death.</p><p>\"Today I'm in pain. They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.</p><p>He had gone out to sell fish at the market and never came back.</p><p>His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.</p><p>\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.</p><p>This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.</p><p>In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.</p><p>They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.</p><p>But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.</p><p>Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.</p><p>But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.</p><p>Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p>Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.</p><p>One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.</p><p>We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.</p><p>Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.</p><p>\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.</p><p>Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions.</p><p>On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.</p><p>\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"</p><p>He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"</p><p>When Osman specified that he wanted limbs from a woman to be used in a ritual, Kanu got down to business: \"The price of a woman is 70m leones [£2,500; $3,000].\"</p><p>Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.</p><p>Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.</p><p>World Health Organization data shows that Sierra Leone - which suffered a brutal civil war in the 1990s and was at the centre of the Ebola epidemic a decade ago - had around 1,000 registered doctors in 2022, compared to reported estimates of 45,000 traditional healers.</p><p>Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.</p><p>Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.</p><p>\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.</p><p>Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.</p><p>It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.</p><p>\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"</p><p>The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.</p><p>\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a researcher at the UK's Aberystwyth University, told the BBC.</p><p>\"Some are misclassified or misreported as accidents, deaths resulting from attacks by wild animals, suicides, natural deaths… Most perpetrators - possibly 90% - are not apprehended.\"</p><p>When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.</p><p>\"I'm not alone, I have up to 250 herbalists working under my banner,\" the man calling himself Idara told Osman, who was again undercover and wearing a secret camera.</p><p>\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.</p><p>He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.</p><p>Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.</p><p>He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.</p><p>\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.</p><p>He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"</p><p>After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.</p><p>This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.</p><p>As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.</p><p>There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.</p><p>The case was referred in August 2023 by a magistrate to the High Court for trial, but two sources have told the BBC it has not been pursued so far and those detained by police have been released on bail.</p><p>My family is facing similar hurdles finding justice. In May, during our BBC investigation, my 28-year-old cousin Fatmata Conteh was murdered in Makeni.</p><p>A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.</p><p>Several of her front teeth were missing, leading the community to believe it was a ritual killing.</p><p>\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.</p><p>We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.</p><p>As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.</p><p>Additional reporting by Chris Alcock and Luis Barrucho</p><p>Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.</p><p></p><p>Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica</p><p>The Gambian government says it is hosting Tchiroma Bakary on humanitarian grounds.</p><p>The raid on a Christian school came amid a surge of attacks by armed groups in the African nation.</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there is a \"renewed commitment to multilateral co-operation\".</p><p>The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups in the African nation.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Business leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year.</p><p>Firms are still reeling from those: the £25bn National Insurance increase and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage.</p><p>Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.</p><p>So what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves?</p><p>We are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.</p><p>And, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the \"big things\" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.</p><p>When it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.</p><p>The head of the CBI business group, Rain Newton-Smith, has said \"stability is the only road to growth\" and urged the government not to hit businesses with more taxes.</p><p>Speaking to the CBI's annual conference, she said the government needed to make \"hard choices for growth now before they get harder, having the courage to take two tough decisions rather than 20 easier ones\".</p><p>\"It means one or two broad tax rises, rather than death by a thousand taxes.\"</p><p></p><p>So what might be in the mix?</p><p>Business rates are a bug-bear. Many firms have seen their bills almost double, after a pandemic-era discount of 75% for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses was cut to 40% last year.</p><p>The chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.</p><p>Business Secretary Peter Kyle addressed the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference on Monday, and had a couple of business-friendly policies to announce.</p><p>He pledged to lower electricity bills for 7,000 British businesses, and said the British Business Bank would focus its lending on the eight \"high potential\" sectors identified in the industrial strategy.</p><p>He told the conference: \"Let's not kid ourselves — actual growth, real growth, comes from enterprise and wealth creation.</p><p>\"We will build a pro-business, pro-wealth creation, pro-growth Britain. This week's budget will take the fair and necessary choices to embed that further.\"</p><p>The chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as \"probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament\", as a way of removing barriers to growth.</p><p>Bank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative.</p><p>It is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis.</p><p>That in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.</p><p>The oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the \"windfall\" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.</p><p>The additional 38% tax, which is on top of a 40% tax rate specific to the industry, is due to expire in 2030. There is a chance it could be phased out earlier.</p><p>Among bosses there is still concern over the government's flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one.</p><p>Rain Newton-Smith told the CBI conference that the government should \"change course\" on the bill and that businesses were not being listened to.</p><p>There is no sign the government is backing off, but Kyle recently told a committee of MPs that there were 26 consultations to come on exactly how these measures will be implemented.</p><p>The business secretary told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that any changes to the law would \"be implemented in a way that is benefiting business and benefiting the people who work in business\".</p><p>\"We do not see this as zero-sum,\" he said.</p><p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the bill her speech to the CBI, saying it would allow new hires to lodge claims with an employment tribunal \"before they've even worked out where the toilets are\".</p><p>She said this would make hiring \"riskier, slower and a lot more expensive\".</p><p>The chancellor is also expected to speak in the Budget about consumers having the \"confidence to spend\".</p><p>Some in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm's wage structure.</p><p>One other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.</p><p>Such schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come.</p><p>What the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.</p><p>After months of anxious waiting business may then breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>According to a recent survey by Barclays, 55% of business leaders say they are delaying investment decisions until they have seen the Budget. But 43% say they expect to increase investment after it, a sign of possible pent-up optimism.</p><p>But confidence is still very fragile.

{"details":"<p>The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.</p><p>More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.</p><p>These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.</p><p>Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.</p><p>But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or \"Hokkaido Valley\", as some have begun to call it - the country could become a new contender in the $600bn (£458bn) race to supply the world's computer chips.</p><p>At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.</p><p>Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.</p><p>The government has invested $12bn in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or \"fab\" in the small city of Chitose.</p><p>In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty.</p><p>Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.</p><p>Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.</p><p>A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.</p><p>The high-tech machinery helped bring about Rapidus' biggest accomplishment yet earlier this year – the successful production of prototype two nanometre (2nm) transistors.</p><p>These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.</p><p>It's a feat only rival chip makers TSMC and Samsung have accomplished. Intel is not pursuing 2nm, it is leapfrogging from 7nm straight to 1.8nm.</p><p>\"We succeeded in manufacturing the 2nm prototype for the first time in Japan, and at an unprecedented speed in Japan and globally,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>He credits the IBM partnership for helping achieve the breakthrough.</p><p>Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.</p><p>Rapidus is confident that it is on track to mass produce 2nm chips by 2027. The challenge will be achieving the yield and quality that is needed to survive in an incredibly competitive market – the very areas where Taiwan and South Korea have pulled ahead.</p><p>TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.</p><p>In a 2024 report, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office highlighted that although Rapidus is receiving government subsidies and consortium members are contributing funds: \"The financing falls short of the expected 5 trillion yen ($31.8bn; £24.4bn) needed to start mass production.\"</p><p>The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: \"Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung).\"</p><p>Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.</p><p>Nevertheless, Japan's government is pouring money into the chip industry - $27bn between 2020 and early 2024 - a larger commitment relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) than the US made through the Biden-era CHIPS Act.</p><p>In late 2024, Tokyo unveiled a $65bn package for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors that could further support Rapidus's expansion plans.</p><p>This comes after decades of decline. Forty years ago Japan made more than half of the world's semiconductors. Today, it produces just over 10%.</p><p>Many point to US-Japan trade tensions in the 1980s as a turning point.</p><p>Naoyuki Yoshino, professor emeritus at Keio University, said Japan lost out in the technology stakes to Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s, leaving domestic companies weaker.</p><p>Unlike its rivals, Japan failed to sustain subsidies to keep its chipmakers competitive.</p><p>But Mr Koike says that mentality has changed.</p><p>\"The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again.\"</p><p>Japan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.</p><p>More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.</p><p>Japan also faces a severe shortage of semiconductor engineers – an estimated 40,000 people in the coming years.</p><p>Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.</p><p>The government's push is already attracting major global players.</p><p>TSMC is producing 12–28nm chips in Kumamoto, on the south-western island of Kyushu - a significant step for Japan, even if it lags behind the company's cutting-edge production in Taiwan.</p><p>The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments.</p><p>Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a \"fab\", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow.</p><p>TSMC started building a second plant on Kyushu in October this year, which is due to begin production by the end of 2027.</p><p>Beyond Rapidus and TSMC, local players like Kioxia and Toshiba are also getting government backing.</p><p>Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.</p><p>American memory chipmaker Micron will also receive $3.63bn in subsidies from the Japanese government to grow facilities in Hiroshima, while Samsung is building a research and development facility in Yokohama.</p><p>Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there.</p><p>\"This will make a form of 'global ecosystem',\" Mr Koike says, \"where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world.\"</p><p>Mr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players.</p><p>\"TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>Global demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers -  still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.</p><p>Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers.</p><p>\"We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.</p><p>And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.</p><p>Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</p><p>Authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate.</p><p>\"Pastor\" Kim Nok-wan, 33, ran a cybersex ring that exploited hundreds of victims including minors.</p><p>India defeated Nepal by seven wickets in the final played in Sri Lankan capital Colombo on Sunday.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>Days of torrential rain leaves vast swathes of the country inundated and facing landslides.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>England's two innings in the first Test lasted fewer than 70 overs combined</p><p>When we heard England were considering sending some players to Canberra for the Lions game, we assumed it would be those in need of practice.</p><p>The three they are sending - Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts - did not feature in the first Test in Perth and seem highly unlikely to play in the second in Brisbane. It is a bizarre situation.</p><p>England's original plan was not to send anyone for the game against the Prime Minister's XI, so little has changed. The likes of Zak Crawley, Joe Root and Harry Brook, who appear to need some time at the crease, will be off to Brisbane to bat in the nets.</p><p>England are responsible for their preparation and their performances on the field. They are responsible for giving it their best shot of winning the Ashes. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</p><p>Australia are a superb team in day-night Tests - they have won 13 of their 14 pink-ball matches. Mitchell Starc is outstanding in those conditions.</p><p>Just because Australia are accustomed to these matches and England are not, it does not mean England cannot win.</p><p>But there is a huge question about whether England would be better prepared playing a game under lights than spending time in the nets in Brisbane.</p><p>England - the management, players and administrators - will be held to account at the end of the Ashes if their plans do not work.</p><p>In the aftermath of the heavy defeat in the first Test I have been struck by the genuine anger among supporters.</p><p>People have spent a lot of money and there is real frustration, a depth of feeling I don't think I have seen before. The England team ignore that at their peril.</p><p>It was the worst defeat of an England team I have seen in a Test in this country. They should have won. Instead, the game was tossed away calamitously and feebly.</p><p>No first-choice England batters in tour match</p><p>I'd be licking my lips bowling to England - McGrath</p><p>For The Love Of Cricket podcast: Mark Wood joins Stuart Broad to reflect on first Test</p><p>I know there has been quite a lot of reaction to the interview Ben Stokes gave to me straight after the match ended. I am not upset if he was a little tetchy. His team had just been humiliated in front of 50,000 people, so to then have to speak to TV and radio is incredibly difficult.</p><p>Stokes told me his team works hard. I cannot disagree with him. We see them train and know they give it absolutely everything. They are supremely fit. Potts looks like he should be in the SAS.</p><p>Does that mean they can go out and play cricket well? Are England working hard on the right things?</p><p>Under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, England have decided they are going to play in a certain way. They say it is a method that gives them the best chance of winning.</p><p>Is that correct? It did not work in the fifth Test against India at The Oval, a game they should have won. It has not worked here.</p><p>When Stokes and McCullum took over, their attitude was a breath of fresh air. It was what England needed after a depressing run of one win in 17 Tests. Across 18 months they played some exhilarating cricket, shredding bowling attacks.</p><p>Supporters fell back in love with the England team, which was vital for the health of the game in our country.</p><p>However, there were some of us who knew the method was unsustainable. The mood around England was positive, so the dissenters stayed quiet.</p><p>But the teams England beat in those early months of the Stokes-McCullum regime were not of the highest quality. They have played three five-Test series and not won any of them. In their past 14 Tests, England have more defeats than wins - seven to six.</p><p>Mitchell Starc has taken more Test wickets with the pink ball than anyone else - 81 at an average of 17.08</p><p>Over the course of 150 years of Test cricket history there is a reason why successful batting has been built of solid defence, not sailing down the pitch and taking a swipe at the bowling.</p><p>I have spoken to a number of former Australia players since the first Test ended. One problem they identified is a lack of accountability in the England set-up.</p><p>\"That's the way we play,\" is a mantra of this England team and it is one of their failings.</p><p>There should be some reflection on what happened in Perth, looking at what happened in a mature fashion.</p><p>The shots Brook was playing were from the third XI of a village team. He needs to grow up. Compare Brook with the wonderful innings of Travis Head. There is a huge difference between recklessness and controlled aggression.</p><p>We have laboured the point about England's limited preparation, but a lot of what we feared came true in the first Test.</p><p>When it was announced that England had only one warm-up game against the Lions, we could have predicted how wickets would fall in the first Test: edging rising deliveries outside off stump by attempting to play booming drives. Look what happened.</p><p>A lot of the anger aimed at England comes from a feeling they do not care. Supporters see the way these England players get out and think it does not matter to them.</p><p>I can categorically say it is not true. The players care deeply. In the aftermath of the Test I saw Crawley in a cafe. He had just bagged a pair, facing only 11 balls in the match.</p><p>He looked utterly miserable, sitting there like a man with a contagious disease. He was certainly not out having a good time, or playing 18 holes on the golf course.</p><p>The golf narrative is another I can defend England from. When they train, they train hard. What are they supposed to do for the rest of the day? Sit in their hotel rooms watching Netflix? There is nothing wrong with being in the fresh air, doing something to take the mind away from cricket.</p><p>England are only 1-0 down. It would be madness to write them off in this series. One thing they can take from Perth is they exposed some vulnerabilities in the Australia team.</p><p>But Stokes, McCullum and the rest must pick themselves up and understand the right way to go about things in Brisbane.</p><p>I once played in a one-day international at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where we got trounced by seven wickets. We walked off in front of 85,000 people knowing we had been thoroughly outplayed. I never wanted to experience that feeling again.</p><p>This England team will have gone through the same in Perth and should now be determined not to have a repeat in Brisbane.</p><p>A result at the Gabba is vital.

Offside in my opinion.\"</p><p>And that is the problem, it is one person's opinion and others can make a valid case the other way.</p><p>The key consideration for the VAR is that the offside players are moving away from the play, and the goalkeeper can see the ball at the time of the shot.</p><p>For many fans it feels like it should be offside. Supporters want just decisions, but VAR has never really been about that. It is about checking the validity of the on-field decision.</p><p>\"Two of those goals were given,\" Hart said of the goals scored by Nottingham Forest and Arsenal. \"So it makes it very difficult and we have these continual conversations, but with VAR the ability they've got is to slow it down and pause it, and you can point out why the goal should be ruled out.\"</p><p>Eberechi Eze scored a hat-trick in the North London derby for Arsenal against Tottenham</p><p>At what point is the threshold crossed for a player making a clear impact on the goalkeeper? The only way you could end these discussions is to make a decision objective, but we should be wary of unintended consequences.</p><p>Would we get more consistent decisions? No doubt, but as we have seen with the handball law if you add more absolutes that simply results in more disallowed goals.</p><p>How about saying that a player being offside in the six-yard box always has to be impacting a goalkeeper? You would still have shades of grey and potentially goals disallowed which are against the spirit of the law.</p><p>If the offside player is at the opposite side of the goal to the keeper, would we really want a goal to be ruled out? If you are being objective, it would have to be.</p><p>That does not feel like a road we would want to go down, which leaves us still with a subjective conundrum.</p><p>VARs are told not to get involved in subjective offside unless a clear error has been made either way. This is why interventions are quite rare, and the borderline decisions like Andy Robertson at Manchester City cause most controversy.</p><p>Last season, there were only two VAR interventions on line of vision, and they both resulted in disallowed goals being awarded: Bernardo Silva for Manchester City at Wolves and Jamie Vardy for Leicester at Fulham.</p><p>In 2023-24, four goals were disallowed for the offence: Rasmus Hojlund for Manchester United at Burnley, Mohamed Salah for Liverpool at Burnley, Lorenz Assignon for Burnley at Crystal Palace and Tawanda Chirewa for Wolves against West Ham.</p><p>Supporters will understandably use these for comparison but while two decisions can be similar they will never be exactly the same. For that reason, we will always have perceived inconsistencies.</p><p>Get news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team</p><p>All your football quizzes in one place</p><p>Premier League index</p><p>Premier League table</p><p>Premier League fixtures</p><p>England will be held to account if preparation backfires - Agnew</p><p>What is going on with offside, and can it be fixed?</p><p>'Salah not helping' - Rooney calls for 'big' decision</p><p>Ruth Wilson stars in Charlotte Bronte's brooding tale of passion</p><p>How a substitute fielder turned the 2005 Ashes around</p><p>Drama based on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's fight for justice</p><p>How did Tyler Perry make his fortune?</p><p>England will be held to account if preparation backfires - Agnew</p><p>What is going on with offside, and can it be fixed?</p><p>Sports Personality of the Year set for 18 December</p><p>'Why things will never be same again for super-talented Eze'</p><p>Newcastle, PSG, Real Madrid... full kits and a London park</p><p>'Salah not helping' - Rooney calls for 'big' decision</p><p>Eze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham  VideoEze hits hat-trick as Arsenal thrash Tottenham</p><p>Vaughan confused by 'amateurish' England plans before second Test.

{"details":"<p>The self-described idyllic life of a family of five living in an Italian forest with horses, donkeys and chickens has stalled after a court ordered the children be removed and placed in foster care.</p><p>Patrol cars were dispatched to remove the children from their home in Abruzzo to a church-run care facility. The mother is staying at the same premise but the parents have limited access to the children, their family lawyer said.</p><p>The fate of the children, known in Italian as the Bimbi nel Bosco or kids in the woods, has captivated the country. Tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition to reunite the family.</p><p>The parents, Nathan Trevallion, a 51-year-old British former professional chef, and Catherine Birmingham, a 45-year-old Australian life coach and former equestrian trainer, were named in an order issued by a L’Aquila court as parents of the children – one eight-year-old and six-year-old twins.</p><p>“The family unit lives in housing hardship as the building has not been declared habitable,” the order states. “The members of the Trevallion family have no social interaction, no fixed income, the home has no toilet facilities, and the children do not attend school. The order is based on the risk of violating the right to social life in consideration of the serious and harmful violations of the children’s rights to physical and mental integrity the parents should be suspended from parental responsibility.”</p><p>Giovanni Angelucci, the family’s lawyer, says the family heats the home with fireplaces and uses solar panels for light and to charge their devices. The family removed running water to avoid microplastics as well as costs and instead draws fresh water from a well on the property. They don’t have an indoor toilet but instead use an outdoor composting toilet.</p><p>The family’s living situation came to light in September 2024 after all five were hospitalized for poisoning after eating wild mushrooms from the forest. After that time, the family was visited by social service officials and law enforcement, but their lawyer said they did not comply with recommendations to have the children receive regular medical care and attend schools.</p><p>Trevallion told local media at the time he was shocked by the decision. “They are happy, smell good, well-mannered, and well-fed; why break this bond?” he said Friday, according to La Repubblica newspaper. CNN reached out to the family via Birmingham’s website, which advises that they don’t check electronic communications often.</p><p>Angelluci said the family will appeal the decision next week.</p><p>Birmingham runs a life coaching and energy reading business, according to her website, which is filled with images of animals and the children – photos the court order said violated the children’s privacy and were posted only to show the appearance of a normal living situation after the social services’ investigation began.</p><p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her deputy Matteo Salvini have both criticized the court decision. Meloni, who said the removal of the children was “alarming,” has called the Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio over the case, according to her spokesman.</p><p>Salvini, who plans to visit the family home next week, told reporters at the Venice Bienniele on Friday that it was “shameful that the State is concerned with private education and the personal life choices of two parents who found Italy a hospitable country, yet it steals their children.”</p><p>The family purchased the home in 2021, at which time Birmingham wrote on her website, “Recently we found our dream forever home. … With the energy of the place being very special, we bring people to stay for healing and awakening, connecting to the wild, without and within, eating home grown and home cooked organic vegan food.”</p><p>Giuseppe Masciulli, the mayor of nearby Palmoli, also condemned the removal of the children. “I’m a father myself, so I was deeply shocked by the situation,” he told CNN, adding that he believed the situation could be resolved if the family promises to meet certain requirements, including reinstalling running water and meeting with the local school on a weekly basis to assess the children’s academic progress.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>A computer scientist who revolutionised the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has called for the UK to be \"brave\" in its pursuit of the technology.</p><p>Llion Jones, who was part of the pioneering Google team that unlocked AI's ability to respond in a human-like form, warned against trying to compete with \"hyper-scalers\" in the United States and China.</p><p>He said the \"sycophantic\" responses of the current wave of AI chatbots needed to be fixed.</p><p>\"We need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Jones, who was raised in Bangor and Abergynolwyn in Gwynedd, north Wales, is one of the co-authors of the 2017 paper Attention Is All You Need, which introduced the Transformer architecture that put the \"T\" in ChatGPT.</p><p>It was a breakthrough that now underpins the generative AI systems that are transforming business and everyday life.</p><p>Still based in Tokyo, he is now the chief technology officer of Sakana AI, the firm he founded with another former Google researcher.</p><p>His company focuses on speculative research into future uses of AI, something he claimed was \"unique\", as other big tech firms were focused on monetising the current wave of large language models.</p><p>\"I do genuinely think that we are unique in that respect right now,\" he told BBC Wales.</p><p>\"I'm trying to make the environment to give people the freedom to do the research they want, and I'm going to try and protect it as long as I can.\"</p><p>Mr Jones said governments in Cardiff and Westminster needed to accept the reality of a global race which was being won by America and China, and focus instead on different types of AI developments.</p><p>\"I think a country like Wales, or even Britain in general, is not going to beat the hyper-scalers, right? They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs.</p><p>\"It doesn't make any sense to be a part of that race, because you're not going to win.</p><p>\"So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave.\"</p><p>He argued that \"something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research\".</p><p>\"It's a bit of a longer bet, but if it pays off then you're back in the race, right?\"</p><p>While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations.</p><p>Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology.</p><p>\"AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,\" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle.</p><p>Some of the businesses at the event \"are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,\" he added.</p><p>\"If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,\" Kyle said.</p><p>He added that a 1% increase in small business productivity would generate £240bn worth of economic activity.</p><p>AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's AI Plan for Wales promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to \"drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive\".</p><p>It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology.</p><p>Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government.</p><p>But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales.</p><p>There have been considerable protests against plans to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas.</p><p>\"Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,\" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons.</p><p>Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands.</p><p>\"What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,\" he said.</p><p>\"There's so much more benefit that comes from the modernisation of grid infrastructure.</p><p>\"When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible.\"</p><p>Mr George warned Wales could \"lose out\" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions.</p><p>Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant \"the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly\".</p><p>While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots.</p><p>\"They've become very sycophantic,\" he said.</p><p>The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, humans love being told that they're right.</p><p>\"This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.'</p><p>\"So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you.\"</p><p>As AI-generated music floods streaming platforms, questions bubble over whether listeners are owed more transparency.</p><p>Appearing from the Vatican via video, the pontiff spoke to youth attending a Catholic conference in the US state of Indiana.</p><p>Strong sales at artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia did little to quell investor worries.</p><p>The accountancy giant says artificial intelligence will eventually lead to fewer entry-level positions at the firm.</p><p>Thousands of earthquakes were caused by magma \"pumping through\" Earth's crust for three months, they say.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>\"The toy is delivered,\" a Ukrainian soldier whispers into the radio.</p><p>In the dead of night, he and his partner move quickly to roll out their cargo from a van. Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.</p><p>The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.</p><p>Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.</p><p>Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.</p><p>Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.</p><p>This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.</p><p>The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.</p><p>The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.</p><p>UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.</p><p>They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.</p><p>About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".</p><p>This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.</p><p>Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.</p><p>It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.</p><p>When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.</p><p>\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"</p><p>The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.</p><p>Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.</p><p>\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.</p><p>Thanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.</p><p>They claim to have surrounded the entire area, but Kyiv has repeatedly denied that.</p><p>The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".</p><p>And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.</p><p>As a result, soldiers remain in frontline positions for weeks, sometimes even months.</p><p>It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.</p><p>A single unit of the 5th brigade can carry out several logistical missions with UGVs in one day.</p><p>Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.</p><p>Supplies are loaded on a land drone called Termit, capable of carrying about 200kg. The operator drives it by remote control into the back of a van which takes it closer to the frontline to preserve its battery.</p><p>When it is dark, two soldiers jump out of the van and roll out the UGV.</p><p>One of them informs the control room via radio that the land drone has been offloaded.</p><p>Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.</p><p>Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.</p><p>At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.</p><p>They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.</p><p>\"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".</p><p>During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.</p><p>Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.</p><p>On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps.</p><p>While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.</p><p>There are 28 key points and while several on the face of it could be acceptable to Ukraine, others cross Kyiv's red lines.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers at the front are angry, defiant and resigned after US plan became public.</p><p>Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>The use of drones is non-intrusive and helps to minimise disruption, National Grid says.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>There's a new song doing the rounds, and in the immortal words of Kylie Minogue, you just can't get it out of your head.</p><p>But what if it was created by a robot, or the artist themself is a product of artificial intelligence (AI)? Do streaming sites have an obligation to label music as AI-generated? And does it even matter, if you like what you hear?</p><p>A survey published last week suggested 97% of respondents could not spot an AI-generated song. But there are some telltale signs - if you know where to look.</p><p>Here's a quick guide.</p><p>AI music became one of last summer's hottest topics after accusations the band The Velvet Sundown were AI-generated sent them viral.</p><p>The band, who had no record label and a minimal social media footprint, quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of monthly listeners on Spotify after releasing two albums just weeks apart - and the music world grew suspicious.</p><p>The band initially denied the claims, later describing themselves as a synthetic project \"guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced and visualised with the support of artificial intelligence\".</p><p>They claimed the project was an \"artistic provocation\", not a trick, but many fans felt betrayed.</p><p>Internet sleuths were suspicious of the band's airbrushed photos, which featured non-descript backgrounds and a warm orange filter.</p><p>There was also no record of them having performed live – no glowing reviews from fans posted online, nor any concert photos or videos. The band members had not given interviews and did not appear to have individual social media accounts.</p><p>Looking into the real-life and social media presence of an artist can be one helpful indicator of whether or not they are real. But experts tell the BBC that fast-developing, sophisticated technology means it is increasingly hard to know when a song has been made using AI.</p><p>Still, while it may be tricky, they say there are signs listeners can be alert to.</p><p>When LJ Rich started creating AI music around five years ago, she recalls how it could only generate three seconds at a time, taking about 10 hours to create a minute of audio.</p><p>Now, an entire song can be summoned rapidly with a single prompt, sparking what industry experts have described as an \"explosion\" of AI music, sometimes referred to as \"slop\" - on streaming platforms.</p><p>A song with a formulaic feel - sweet but without much substance or emotional weight - can be a sign of AI, says the musician and technology speaker, as well as vocals that feel breathless.</p><p>AI songs tend to stick to generic verse-chorus structures, and usually don't have a satisfying ending. AI is also more likely to create lyrics that follow a correct grammatical structure, says Rich, whereas some of the most beautiful or memorable words penned by humans don't always make sense.</p><p>Just ask Alicia Keys and her \"concrete jungle where dreams are made of\", or The Rolling Stones and their flirtation with double negatives in (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.</p><p>\"If it doesn't feel emotional, it's a really big part,\" the former BBC Click presenter continues. \"Does it create that tension and resolution that is a fundamental part of the music that we love? Does it have a story inside it?\"</p><p>Another tell-tale sign is unrealistic levels of productivity. Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, describes how one artist was recently believed to be AI after dropping multiple soundalike albums simultaneously.</p><p>Their songs resembled a mashup of 80s rock bands – like \"really classic rock hits that had been put in a blender\".</p><p>\"This will be fine for background music for most people,\" she continues, \"but it won't work for creating the superstars of the future who, of course, draw on the past but then make something completely new out of it.\"</p><p>Sometimes, what might stand out is a song that sounds almost too perfect, lacking minor flaws and variances.</p><p>This could mean no strain in the vocals, and overly polished production, according to Tony Rigg, music industry adviser and lecturer in music industry management at the University of Lancashire.</p><p>He adds that odd phrasing, unnatural emotional delivery, and lyrics that feel generic or repetitive can also be clues.</p><p>\"AI hasn't felt heartbreak yet... It knows patterns,\" he explains. \"What makes music human is not just sound but the stories behind it.\"</p><p>It's also worth paying close attention to the vocals. AI \"singers\" often sound a little slurred. Consonants and plosives (hard sounds like \"p\" and \"t\") aren't quite right. You might hear \"ghost\" harmonies, where backing vocals appear and disappear at random.</p><p>However, Rigg calls these signs \"hints not proof\", acknowledging it is not very easy for the casual listener to detect AI-generated songs.</p><p>As well as being used to generate full songs, AI is also becoming a tool some established artists are using to support their creativity.</p><p>There currently isn't any obligation – or consistent way – for artists to let fans know if and how they are using AI.</p><p>Some are very open: the Beatles, for example, used machine learning to extract the voice of John Lennon from a 1970s cassette recording to release what they called their \"last song\", Now and Then, in 2023.</p><p>And artists including Imogen Heap and Timbaland have created AI personas and released singles under their names.</p><p>Last month, Heap released the song Aftercare with her AI model ai.Mogen, trained on her voice.</p><p>She created the voice model as a chatbot - a \"desperate attempt\" to keep up with a deluge of messages and requests including from fans - but more recently, it has featured on several songs and allowed Heap to take part in more collaborations than she otherwise would have due to time constraints.</p><p>While \"it does sound different if you really know my voice\", she says she has put a lot of work into making the AI version of her voice sound human and doesn't think listeners would be able to tell.</p><p>Heap isn't trying to mislead listeners –  ai.Mogen is listed as a co-contributor on the track.</p><p>But she hopes if people feel a human connection to the song, without already knowing part of the vocals are sung by her AI model, they might reconsider any preconceived negative ideas or fears they have about AI.</p><p>\"I hope that people listen, don't realise, find peace in that,\" she tells the BBC.</p><p>She says she isn't against using AI to actually create music, but it's just not something she's got around to doing yet.</p><p>Heap believes there should be more transparency around what goes into a song, and how AI has been used.</p><p>Citing the example of someone reading the label of a microwave ready meal so they know the ingredients, she says: \"We need that for music, and we need that for AI.\"</p><p>There is currently no legal obligation for streaming platforms to label AI-generated songs, despite increasing calls for them to signpost such tracks.</p><p>In January, the streaming platform Deezer launched an AI detection tool, followed this summer by a system which tags AI-generated music.</p><p>Deezer says its detection system can flag tracks made with the most prolific AI music creation tools, and is working on expanding its ability to detect music made by others. It says the risk of false positives - eg incorrectly flagging a track created by a human - is very low.</p><p>This week, the company said a third (34%) of content uploaded to its platform was fully AI-generated – about 50,000 tracks a day.</p><p>Manuel Moussallam, Deezer's director of research, says his team was so surprised by how many tracks were flagged up by the detector when it first launched they were \"pretty convinced we had an issue\".</p><p>The tool quickly flagged up the music by The Velvet Sundown – the band who went viral over the summer – as being \"100% AI-generated\".</p><p>Other platforms have recently announced steps toward more transparency.</p><p>In September, Spotify said it would roll out a new spam filter later this year to identify \"bad actors\", and prevent \"slop\" being recommended to listeners. In the past year, it has removed more than 75 million spam tracks.</p><p>It is also supporting a way to enable artists to say where and how AI was used in a track, through a system by a consortium of industry members called DDEX. This information will be included in the metadata of a track and displayed on its app.</p><p>Spotify says it is about recognising listeners' desire for more information, as well as \"strengthening trust\".</p><p>\"It's not about punishing artists who use AI responsibly or down-ranking tracks for disclosing information about how they were made.\"</p><p>If you've fallen hard for a new artist, does it matter if they or their songs are made by AI?</p><p>Some believe the presence of AI is irrelevant – engagement is driven by enjoyment, and music people love is already serving its primary purpose.</p><p>Others say music fans should be able to make informed choices about what they listen to.</p><p>Artists have shared deep concerns around the impact of AI, and hundreds of musicians including Dua Lipa and Sir Elton John have protested about the use of their songs in the training of AI tools.</p><p>For LJ Rich, the use of AI in music raises many \"weird and beautiful ethical questions\" which remain as yet unanswered.</p><p>\"Like if the music makes the hairs on the back of your neck go up, does it matter if an AI wrote it or not?\"</p><p>The musician was known for hits like You Can Get It If You Really Want and I Can See Clearly Now.</p><p>The Never Gonna Give You Up singer performs at the Shropshire venue on 24 July.</p><p>You can find many different music playlists for dogs and cats online. Do they actually help animals relax?</p><p>Computer scientist Llion Jones helped discover how to create human-like responses from AI technology.</p><p>The 17-year-old is playing Kim in the production, which began its UK tour this week.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.
