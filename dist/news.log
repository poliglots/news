However, a US official on Tuesday told the BBC that its team would be meeting Russian representatives in Abu Dhabi to further discuss the plan.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov – who is not attending the meeting – said the Kremlin has yet to receive the \"interim\" version of the revised plan, adding that Moscow's view was that it should reflect the \"spirit and letter\" of the Alaska talks between Trump and President Vladimir Putin in August.</p><p>Separately, a virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting of Ukraine's European allies will also be taking place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Zelensky said he had a \"good and very productive\" conversation with Starmer, in which they discussed the agenda for the meeting.</p><p>The latest round of talks come as Russia and Ukraine exchanged overnight strikes.</p><p>Kyiv's military administration chief, Tymur Tkachenko, said a fire had broken out at a high-rise residential apartment building in the Dniprovskyi district, forcing the evacuation of its residents.</p><p>Emergency services on the scene said 18 people had been rescued, including three children, and the search for victims was ongoing after the fire had been contained.</p><p>Residents of a high-rise apartment in the city's central Pechersk district were also evacuated after it was set ablaze during the strikes according to Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko.</p><p>He added that the building suffered damage to the upper floors, but the fire had been extinguished.</p><p>Ukraine's air defence units responded to the attack as explosions were heard across Kyiv and residents were urged to take shelter in underground car parks and bunkers.</p><p>Ukraine's Ministry of Energy also confirmed a \"massive, combined enemy attack\" on the country's energy infrastructure facilities.</p><p>According to Zelensky, 22 missiles and more than 460 drones were launched at Ukraine overnight.</p><p>Nato scrambled four planes over Romania - the third time in four days its planes have been sent to intercept drones in Ukraine's border region.

Moscow' forces also control Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p><p>The European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the final peace plan should make it impossible for Moscow to invade again, and that Russia should \"definitely not\" rejoin the G8.</p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, she said: \"We can't go back to business as usual... how could you imagine that?\"</p><p>Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.</p><p>Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>There are 28 key points and while several on the face of it could be acceptable to Ukraine, others cross Kyiv's red lines.</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers at the front are angry, defiant and resigned after US plan became public.</p><p>The use of drones is non-intrusive and helps to minimise disruption, National Grid says.</p><p>A submarine expert says he is \"confident\" the recovered object is an imploded Russian sonobuoy.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.</p><p>The 28-point peace plan drafted by the US and Russia to end the war in Ukraine stunned Europeans with its sweeping provisions perceived as too favourable for Russia.</p><p>The terms also implied a loss of control for the Europeans about their own security framework and would see them stripped of key leverage points over Moscow.</p><p>The EU and allies are now pushing to have a say on what comes next, particularly on matters that would require their participation – from sanctions to defence.</p><p>These are the key issues in the talks that directly concern Europeans:</p><p>Ukraine has long aspired to join NATO, the transatlantic alliance that protects its members with a clause of collective defence. Battered by Russia's invasion, Ukraine sees Article 5 as the most powerful deterrence against future aggression.</p><p>Earlier this year, Secretary General Mark Rutte spoke about an \"irreversible path of Ukraine to enter NATO\", but the roadmap for Ukraine is far from clear, with no consensus among allies. For Moscow, Kyiv's admission is a red line.</p><p>The draft plan leaked last week featured a broad clause to keep Ukraine out – forever.</p><p>\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO, and NATO agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future,\" it said.</p><p>The wording of the sentence went down badly with Europeans, as it would effectively impose a Russian veto on the alliance, which could set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>Europeans insist that any decisions involving NATO must be made by NATO allies only.</p><p>This logic would also apply to another element of the peace plan: the potential deployment of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil. This idea was initially pitched by the \"Coalition of the Willing\" led by France and the United Kingdom.</p><p>In September, French President Emmanuel Macron announced 26 countries had agreed to send troops to Ukraine as part of a \"reassurance force\" or to provide assistance on land, at sea or in the air as part of future security guarantees.</p><p></p><p>The European Union has imposed 19 packages of sanctions against Russia in an effort to cripple Russia's ability to finance the war.</p><p>The sanctions are vast and complex, covering imports, exports, banking, energy, transport, defence, services and media, as well as a blacklist of over 2,700 individuals and entities accused of aiding the Russian war machine.</p><p>Sanctions relief has always been at the top of the Kremlin's wish-list.</p><p>A first attempt in March was firmly rebuffed by Brussels. Now, they are giving it another try: the 28-point plan speaks of lifting sanctions \"in stages and on a case-by-case basis\".</p><p>Whether the economic reprieve ever happens will largely depend on the EU, which governs the largest sanctions regime among Western allies.</p><p>Officials and diplomats are reluctant to undo the sanctions so fast and with no guarantees that Russia won't attack Ukraine again.</p><p>As talks continue, the bloc is expected to push for a drawn-out, carefully designed timeline that can allow it to reimpose the hard-biting penalties at any given moment.</p><p>Even if the relief were to be granted, some crucial components exceed the realm of sanctions. The EU is currently working on an irreversible phase-out of all purchases of Russian energy by 2028, depriving Moscow of its once-reliable clientele.</p><p>No sanction has given the bloc greater leverage than the immobilisation of the assets of the Russian Central Bank, worth a whopping €210 billion across EU territory.</p><p>The assets are at the forefront of an audacious plan to issue a reparations loan that can cover Ukraine's financial and military needs for 2026 and 2027. With the US retreating from assisting Kyiv, the weight falls entirely on the EU.</p><p>The reparations loan would use the cash balances generated by the Russian assets and be repaid only if Moscow agreed to compensate for war damages.</p><p>But the 28-point plan published last week dramatically flipped the script as it envisages splitting the assets into two separate investment funds that would allow both the US and Russia to benefit commercially.</p><p>That has caused outrage and dismay among Europeans, who see the assets as their most powerful tool to make Russia pay for the damages caused.</p><p>With negotiations moving at a fast-tracked pace, Europeans insist the assets cannot be unfrozen easily, and Russia should pay compensation in the form of reparations. An official told Euronews the plan published last week was \"economic brutality\".</p><p>António Costa, the president of the European Council, said a decision on how to plug Ukraine's financing gap would be taken in mid-December.</p><p></p><p>The 28-point plan also states that Russia should be invited back to the G8 in a move that would end Putin's isolation from the international stage and the great global powers. President Trump has publicly stated he would support bringing Russia back.</p><p>Russia was indefinitely suspended from the G8 in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea. The group was rebranded as the G7 and has since kept the name.</p><p>\"Putin speaks to me, he doesn't speak to anybody else because he was insulted when he got thrown out of the G8,\" Trump said in June, calling the suspension a \"big mistake\".</p><p>As a consensus-based organisation, bringing Russia into the group would require the approval of all the sitting members, including Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Canada and Japan, as well as the EU.

{"details":"<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene's five years in Congress will come to an early end on 5 January after she unexpectedly announced her resignation following a bitter rift with President Donald Trump.</p><p>The surprise move from the Georgia congresswoman - a rising star in the Republican party - has left many speculating about her next steps.</p><p>Her decision follows a public fallout with Trump, who branded her \"a traitor\" and said he would endorse her opponent in next year's election.</p><p>It comes after months of Greene's blistering criticism on the Trump administration's refusal to release files related to the investigation into the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein - as well as several of Trump's policy positions.</p><p>Rumours have already begun circulating that Greene, 51, might run for president in 2028, which she immediately shot down. So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene?</p><p>Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.</p><p>When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna.</p><p>Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance.</p><p>Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".</p><p>\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article.</p><p>Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter.</p><p>She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding.</p><p>Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.</p><p>Elections for both take place in 2026.</p><p>Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements.</p><p>Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.</p><p>Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.</p><p>In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".</p><p>\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.</p><p>Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.</p><p>Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.</p><p>\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse.</p><p>\"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"</p><p>Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.</p><p>\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.</p><p>If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena.</p><p>After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast.</p><p>The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast.</p><p>Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.</p><p>Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days.</p><p>\"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.</p><p>In the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump.</p><p>Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\".</p><p>\"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.</p><p>Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.</p><p>In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial.</p><p>The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website.</p><p>With reporting by Max Matza</p><p>Thomas King, whose works centered around indigenous stories, said he feels as though he's \"been ripped in half\" after learning he is not part Cherokee.</p><p>The trial in Dresden comes shortly after the US designated the Antifa Ost group as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Airlines are told to resume flights to Venezuela within 48 hours or risk losing their clearance to fly there.</p><p>Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites.</p><p>The executive order calls for a report into whether to label the group a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Huda Ammori calls into question the pro-Palestine group’s ban under ‘antiterrorism’ laws.</p><p>By Federica Marsi</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>The cofounder of Palestine Action is set to begin a legal challenge against the UK’s controversial proscription of the group as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>Huda Ammori will bring the case before London’s High Court on Wednesday, after the Court of Appeal last month found reasonable grounds to argue that the proscription order interferes with the rights to freedom of speech and protest.</p><p>The judicial review is expected to begin on Wednesday. The next hearings are scheduled for Thursday and December 2.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If Ammori succeeds, the ban could potentially be lifted, bringing an end to a months-long campaign of civil disobedience that has resulted in hundreds of arrests.</p><p>More than 2,000 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for showing support for the organisation since it was outlawed in July, mostly for holding signs reading: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>Being a member of or showing support for the direct action group is currently a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>The government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned the group after two of its members broke into the RAF Brize Norton military base in Oxfordshire in June and sprayed red paint on Voyager planes that activists said were used in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>In a separate incident in August 2024, members of the group broke into the premises of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Filton, Bristol, and reportedly destroyed quadcopter drones, which the group says are used by the Israeli military in Gaza to target Palestinians. A total of 24 activists linked to the group remain under arrest.</p><p>Ammori told Al Jazeera that the ban against Palestine Action is “absurd and authoritarian”.</p><p>“Proscribing Palestine Action wasn’t done to protect the public, it was done to crush dissent and defend the Israeli weapons industry,” she said.</p><p>“This is an opportunity for the courts to right the wrongs that the government has done, and reinstate a bit of sanity. If we are not successful, we will continue to fight the ban, and I am sure that ultimately, we will win.”</p><p>Defend Our Juries, a campaign group coordinating protests across the United Kingdom during which sign-wielding demonstrators are routinely arrested, argued the ban is “political”.</p><p>“The reason there are protest groups is because our government isn’t listening to what the continuous protests are about,” Lex Korte, the group’s legal coordinator and cofounder, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In recent months, thousands of protesters at mass rallies, experts of international law and human rights groups have called on the UK to end its alleged complicity in Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. The UK provides vital components of F-35 jets and operates Shadow R1 surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The ban on Palestine Action marked the first time in British history that a direct action group has been branded as a terrorist organisation. It is also the first time that a proscribed group has been granted a judicial review.</p><p>Korte said the term “terrorism” has always had a strong political connotation.</p><p>“The UK definition of terrorism, particularly in the Terrorism Act 2000, has been criticised as being way too vague and [of including] acts that aren’t acts of terrorism, namely the inclusion of criminal damage that doesn’t require any acts of violence towards humans,” he said.</p><p>“Inviting arrest with your behaviour and with that kind of method, we’re highlighting the unjust nature of the proscription of Palestine Action,” Korte said.</p><p>London-based human rights advocacy organisation Cage International highlighted the “draconian use of terrorism legislation to shut down direct action” in a report issued on Tuesday.</p><p>“Direct action has been neither random nor gratuitous. It has been focused on the specific nodes that make war possible: manufacturers, insurers, logistics providers, financiers, universities, lobbyists, and government infrastructure,” it said.</p><p>“When ordinary channels fail to restrain state-sanctioned harm, principled disruption becomes not only legitimate but necessary.”</p><p>The report argues that the UK continues to support the war in Gaza with military, trade and diplomatic ties, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) having concluded in July 2024 that Israel’s prolonged presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, constitutes a breach of international law.</p><p>The ICJ also found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six provisional measures to mitigate the risk of such acts.</p><p>Cage found Palestine Action has spurred a wave of civil disobedience between 2020 and 2025, leading to a “significant shift in the landscape of activism in the UK”. This resulted in the shutdown of operations at sites connected to the production or facilitation of weapons used by Israeli forces, such as  Elbit’s site in Bristol that was the subject of dozens of protests by Palestine Action, including days before the group was proscribed.</p><p>“Over the last two years of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the UK has steadily expanded its authoritarian counter-terrorism powers to suppress dissent and insulate itself from public accountability,”  Anas Mustapha, Cage’s Head of Public Advocacy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the proscription of Palestine Action went beyond the bounds of what the public would tolerate. It backfired precisely because the greater community consciousness has shifted.

{"details":"<p>A US judge has dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the charges was unlawfully appointed.</p><p>Judge Cameron Currie said that Lindsey Halligan, who was handpicked by Trump to bring the charges against two of his political adversaries, was never eligible to assume the post.</p><p>Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and described the prosecutions as political in nature.</p><p>In response to the ruling, the White House told the BBC:  \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter.\"</p><p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Comey and James, declaring in one social media post, \"They're all guilty as hell\", and later adding \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"</p><p>In her decision on Monday, Judge Currie wrote that Halligan, a former White House aide who had never prosecuted a case before, was not authorised to present the charges to the grand jury.</p><p>\"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie ruled.</p><p>Halligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, an interim US attorney who resigned in September amid the Trump administration's pressure to file charges against both Comey and James.</p><p>Judge Currie determined that Halligan's appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys. Under that law, the attorney general has 120 days to make an interim appointment - a period that began on 21 January with Siebert's designation, the judge noted.</p><p>When that 120-day window closed on 21 May, the attorney general's authority to appoint an interim replacement expired as well, Judge Currie wrote. As a result, Halligan \"has been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her 22 September appointment.</p><p>The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning the justice department could potentially refile the case at a later date.</p><p>The department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the justice department would appeal against the dismissal of Comey and James's cases \"very soon\".</p><p>She said the administration's position was that Halligan had been legally appointed.

{"details":"<p>Huda Ammori calls into question the pro-Palestine group’s ban under ‘antiterrorism’ laws.</p><p>By Federica Marsi</p><p>Share</p><p>Save</p><p>The cofounder of Palestine Action is set to begin a legal challenge against the UK’s controversial proscription of the group as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>Huda Ammori will bring the case before London’s High Court on Wednesday, after the Court of Appeal last month found reasonable grounds to argue that the proscription order interferes with the rights to freedom of speech and protest.</p><p>The judicial review is expected to begin on Wednesday. The next hearings are scheduled for Thursday and December 2.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If Ammori succeeds, the ban could potentially be lifted, bringing an end to a months-long campaign of civil disobedience that has resulted in hundreds of arrests.</p><p>More than 2,000 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for showing support for the organisation since it was outlawed in July, mostly for holding signs reading: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>Being a member of or showing support for the direct action group is currently a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>The government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned the group after two of its members broke into the RAF Brize Norton military base in Oxfordshire in June and sprayed red paint on Voyager planes that activists said were used in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>In a separate incident in August 2024, members of the group broke into the premises of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Filton, Bristol, and reportedly destroyed quadcopter drones, which the group says are used by the Israeli military in Gaza to target Palestinians. A total of 24 activists linked to the group remain under arrest.</p><p>Ammori told Al Jazeera that the ban against Palestine Action is “absurd and authoritarian”.</p><p>“Proscribing Palestine Action wasn’t done to protect the public, it was done to crush dissent and defend the Israeli weapons industry,” she said.</p><p>“This is an opportunity for the courts to right the wrongs that the government has done, and reinstate a bit of sanity. If we are not successful, we will continue to fight the ban, and I am sure that ultimately, we will win.”</p><p>Defend Our Juries, a campaign group coordinating protests across the United Kingdom during which sign-wielding demonstrators are routinely arrested, argued the ban is “political”.</p><p>“The reason there are protest groups is because our government isn’t listening to what the continuous protests are about,” Lex Korte, the group’s legal coordinator and cofounder, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In recent months, thousands of protesters at mass rallies, experts of international law and human rights groups have called on the UK to end its alleged complicity in Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. The UK provides vital components of F-35 jets and operates Shadow R1 surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The ban on Palestine Action marked the first time in British history that a direct action group has been branded as a terrorist organisation. It is also the first time that a proscribed group has been granted a judicial review.</p><p>Korte said the term “terrorism” has always had a strong political connotation.</p><p>“The UK definition of terrorism, particularly in the Terrorism Act 2000, has been criticised as being way too vague and [of including] acts that aren’t acts of terrorism, namely the inclusion of criminal damage that doesn’t require any acts of violence towards humans,” he said.</p><p>“Inviting arrest with your behaviour and with that kind of method, we’re highlighting the unjust nature of the proscription of Palestine Action,” Korte said.</p><p>London-based human rights advocacy organisation Cage International highlighted the “draconian use of terrorism legislation to shut down direct action” in a report issued on Tuesday.</p><p>“Direct action has been neither random nor gratuitous. It has been focused on the specific nodes that make war possible: manufacturers, insurers, logistics providers, financiers, universities, lobbyists, and government infrastructure,” it said.</p><p>“When ordinary channels fail to restrain state-sanctioned harm, principled disruption becomes not only legitimate but necessary.”</p><p>The report argues that the UK continues to support the war in Gaza with military, trade and diplomatic ties, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) having concluded in July 2024 that Israel’s prolonged presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, constitutes a breach of international law.</p><p>The ICJ also found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six provisional measures to mitigate the risk of such acts.</p><p>Cage found Palestine Action has spurred a wave of civil disobedience between 2020 and 2025, leading to a “significant shift in the landscape of activism in the UK”. This resulted in the shutdown of operations at sites connected to the production or facilitation of weapons used by Israeli forces, such as  Elbit’s site in Bristol that was the subject of dozens of protests by Palestine Action, including days before the group was proscribed.</p><p>“Over the last two years of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the UK has steadily expanded its authoritarian counter-terrorism powers to suppress dissent and insulate itself from public accountability,”  Anas Mustapha, Cage’s Head of Public Advocacy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the proscription of Palestine Action went beyond the bounds of what the public would tolerate. It backfired precisely because the greater community consciousness has shifted. People could see with their own eyes what is happening in Gaza, and they recognise those acting to stop British participation in such acts.”</p><p>Korte, of Defend Our Juries, said judges at London’s High Court would have to understand “the gravitas that [their] decision has, both to everyday people and their lives and to the international community and the people of Palestine”.</p><p>Israel has pummelled Gaza since October 2023, killing at least 69,733 Palestinians and wounding 170,863.

The EU is hoping to improve the quota and improve the terms.</p><p>Vestager said the EU must stand by its landmark legislation of the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act approved during her tenure.</p><p>“This is not crazy,” she told Euronews. “This is not against anyone. This is normal. It is what you would ask in a normal market.”</p><p>“Promises were made to Europeans that digital services would be safe to use,” she added.</p><p>Vestager, who served as EU Commissioner from 2014 to 2024, rose to international fame for taking on Big Tech giants, issuing antitrust fines against Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon - a stance that once earned her the nickname “tax lady” from Donald Trump.</p><p>She also played a central role in bringing the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into force, the landmark regulation designed to rein in the power of the largest online platforms, and which some in Washington have viewed as an attack on US economic interests.</p><p>\"We have promised Europeans that their services would be safe to use for their mental health, for democracy, and that is of course core in any democracy that you stand by the promises made,” Vestager told Euronews.</p><p>A European official told Euronews after the US-EU talks Monday that steel, aluminium and digital are two separate dossiers and should be treated as such.</p><p>EU trade boss Maroš Šefčovič and the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met on Monday.</p><p>Lutnick, who is a close ally of President Donald Trump and negotiated on his behalf a trade deal with the EU over the summer introducing 15% tariffs, said that European should reassess the way they implement their flagship policies on digital regulation if they want further tariff relief.</p><p>Lutnick did not call to remove the rules but did say the way in which they are applied should be \"more balanced\" for American tech companies.</p><p>Brussels is desperately seeking to obtain a reduction of the 50% tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on European aluminium and steel in June under pressure from the industry.</p><p>The US does want the EU \"to put these rules away, but find the balanced approach that works for us,\" he told reporters in Brussels. “Then we will, together with them, handle the steel and aluminium issues.”</p><p>Lutnick and Greer also met EU Tech Commissioner Henna Virkkunen who stressed in a statement the importance of the Digital Market Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA), the two landmark digital regulations applied in the EU. The comments suggest the Commission is not ready to water them further for the time being.</p><p>To counter the US offensive on its digital legislation, EU Trade Commissioner Šefčovič said that the EU is working hard to explain its legislation to the US and stressed that there no discriminatory practices applied to US companies. The rules, he argued, are the same for everyone operating in the EU single market regardless of their origin.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"EU must stand by its digital rules promises, Vestager tells Euronews","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/11/25/eu-must-stand-by-the-promises-made-on-digital-rules-vestager-tells-euronews","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-25T08:27:58.000Z"}

But when the situation changes, we have the right and a possibility to consider other strictest measures,\" Ruginienė told reporters Monday.</p><p>\"We must convene and discuss all actions that we are taking. We might close the border, and a decision will be made if the situation does not improve,\" she added.</p><p>Rugienenė said the possibility of restoring border restrictions would be discussed with ministers and senior security officials at a meeting of the National Security Commission.</p><p>The warning came after a series of incidents that disrupted Vilnius airport operations multiple times. Dozens of flights were cancelled, others were delayed, and many were diverted to other airports. The airport was temporarily closed last Thursday — the same day the border reopened after an earlier closure.</p><p>According to National Crisis Management Centre head Vilmantas Vitkauskas, Lithuania faced its most massive weather balloon raid carrying contraband in November over the weekend.</p><p>Vilnius has characterised the balloon incidents as a form of hybrid attack.</p><p>\"We see that the hybrid attack is expanding geographically, and tonight we saw balloons crossing the border with Latvia,\" Rugienenė said. \"This means that this is no longer a Lithuanian problem, but a problem of a wider region.\"</p><p>The prime minister said the initial border closure had produced positive results, leading to a marked reduction in balloon incidents. In response to Lithuania's border closure, Minsk blocked Lithuanian lorries from leaving Belarus, leaving many stranded.</p><p>\"Smuggled balloons are flying and will probably continue to fly,\" Rugienenė said. \"The border closure has shown one thing: we were right to assess this as a hybrid attack.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, several balloons carrying contraband were detected in Latvia on Sunday, according to Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis speaking to TV3 television.</p><p>\"The work is still ongoing and the volumes are being clarified, but this phenomenon exists,\" Kozlovskis said.</p><p>Armed forces radar systems recorded the balloons, each carrying around 60,000 cigarettes on average, flying at an altitude of approximately 5 kilometres and drifting into Latvia from Belarus.</p><p>Police said the balloons were used to smuggle 720,000 cigarettes into the country. One balloon landed in a forest 60 kilometres from the border.</p><p></p><p>\"They are almost impossible to control, they are carried by the wind,\" said Valdis Juksh, head of the Daugavpils Regional Department of the State Border Guard.</p><p>\"After a certain time, when the gas cools down, they descend, but the place where they will land is completely unpredictable. They have GPS trackers attached to them, and that's how the people involved in this illegal activity track and retrieve them.\"</p><p>Two locals have been arrested on suspicion of smuggling.</p><p>According to the border service, there has been an increase in illegal migration, with 30 people detained over the past 24 hours attempting to enter Latvia illegally.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Lithuania may close Belarus border again over contraband balloons","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/25/lithuania-may-close-belarus-border-again-over-cigarette-smuggling-balloons","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-25T12:44:49.000Z"}
{"details":"<p>Each year, starting in the late autumn, a cultural phenomenon known as \"cuffing season\" creeps onto the modern dating scene, when single people seek out a romantic relationship for the cold, dark winter months. But is there any science to it?</p><p>'Tis the season to be cuffed.</p><p>To clarify, I'm not encouraging bad behaviour, but referring to the cultural phenomenon known as \"cuffing season\" – when single people wave goodbye to the freedom and frivolity of summer and seek out romantic relationships for the dark, arduous months of the year. I can see the appeal, if not the mere convenience, at least; perhaps it would be nice to have a special someone to dance with under the glistening lights, or cling to amidst the chaos of obligatory family gatherings where a distant relative will undoubtedly, as you're blissfully chomping through a mince pie, interrogate you about your dating life.</p><p>Where the term \"cuffing season\" came from is unclear, though it is suggested that it emerged around 2009 – with \"getting cuffed\" used as slang for entering a committed relationship. But do people really seek out a partner, deliberately, for the winter? And if so, can this behaviour tell us something about human psychology, or even our evolutionary biology? I found out whether there's any science behind it.</p><p>\"Cuffing season refers to this idea that mating behaviours are seasonal,\" says Christine Ma-Kellams, associate professor of psychology at San Jose State University in California. But there's not a consensus on why it happens. If you look at modern-day behaviours, Ma-Kellams says, \"Searches for things like porn and dating websites, even prostitution, peak twice a year, so not only in the winter, but in the summer as well\". Take this 2012 study on the volume of internet searches for sex-related terms, for example. The results demonstrated a consistent six-month cycle, with peaks in search interest occurring in winter and summer.</p><p>Another study from the 1990s sought to find out whether there were seasonal variations of sexual activity. To do this, researchers plotted birth rates outside of marriage, abortions, sexually transmitted infections and condom sales, and found that there was an increase in sexual activity (and unsafe sex) around the Christmas period. However, there have been no recent studies that can suggest this trend is ongoing.</p><p>Nevertheless, data from dating apps suggests that autumn and winter is the most popular time to match with a partner. Dating app Bumble's research shows that the most popular time to swipe is between late November and mid-February – perfect timing for a Valentine's Day breakup – a \"highly scripted\" day of expectation which, according to these researchers, can arguably cause the demise of relationships rather than enhance them.</p><p>\"We know that people are somewhat thinking about this idea of romance and the holidays,\" says Justin Garcia, executive director of The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, an interdisciplinary research centre for sexuality and relationships, and author of The Intimate Animal. Garcia is also dating site Match.com's chief scientific advisor. \"Online dating occurs throughout the whole year. There's a lot of activity, millions of swipes and messages being sent every day, but you see a real ramp up in those winter months.\" Of course, we can theorise why this might be – possibly as we're stuck inside or at our family home where the only means of connecting with new people is through our phones.</p><p>Perhaps, to find out if dating really is seasonal, we could turn to our animal friends for guidance. Some species – not all – reproduce seasonally. Have humans evolved to do the same?</p><p>\"There are species who reproduce very strictly on a seasonal basis, let's say cows, because cattle have a very long gestation and they have to have fresh grass at the time their babies [are] born,\" says Sue Carter, distinguished university scientist and professor emerita of biology at Indiana University. Birds are another species that reproduce seasonally.</p><p>Humans, however, do not. \"Humans are opportunistic in their sex behaviour and in their social behaviour. We're not seasonal. If there's an opportunity to have sex, many individuals will,\" says Carter.</p><p>The seasonal variability in birth rates supports this. While the typical birth pattern in the US has been characterised by a September peak – which matches up to a winter conception – birth rates vary across locations and time. \"People say it's [the autumn peak] in response to Christmas and the New Year,\" says Randy Nelson, professor chair of neurological research at West Virginia University.</p><p>However, \"nobody's really seen breeding seasons in terms of bursts that you couldn't explain by some other reason that's not biology. It's almost always cultural or social,\" says Nelson. Some Indigenous agricultural communities, he adds, see more births nine months after the harvest. \"And again, it's socially driven… nine months after the harvest is complete, you see a birth spike.\"</p><p>Instead, Nelson says, \"the primary seasonality that people focus on [in humans] is seasonal affective disorder (Sad). It's a biological phenomenon.\" Sad, a recurring winter depression, affects around 1-3% of adults in temperate countries, and is more prevalent in women. (Read more about how seasonal affective disorder affects our sex drive in this story).</p><p>Research suggests that for people living in temperate climates like in the UK, their mental health is poorer during the colder months. The limited daylight hours and cold weather means we spend less time outside, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation. When we absorb less daylight, our serotonin levels are reduced too. Serotonin is a crucial neurotransmitter that helps to regulate our circadian rhythm (our internal body clock that regulates our sleep and wake cycles), as well as our behaviour and mood. Essentially, low serotonin levels affects our biological functioning.</p><p>\"Basically, we live in caves in autumn and winter,\" says Nelson. Most people don't have the opportunity to get outside – they may get up in the dark, work under artificial light, and go home in the dark. \"To make it [our body clock] precisely 24 hours to optimise all your biological functions, including your hormone levels and neurotransmitters and so on, you need to be exposed to bright light. But in winter, we never see that bright light,\" he says.</p><p>Maybe, in this case, we strive to make ourselves feel better in other ways – for example, through finding romance.</p><p>\"Dysregulating circadian rhythms can also lead to some of these depressive-like or lack of certain hormones, including oxytocin and lack of certain dopaminergic and serotonergic interactions in the brain,\" Nelson says. \"So I think winter may lead to [the mindset of] 'I'm hungry for some dopamine, I'm hungry for some oxytocin, maybe this person will provide that.'\"</p><p>Oxytocin is known as the \"love hormone\" – largely because of its role in maternal reproduction, social bonding and stress reduction. It is released into our bloodstream by the pituitary gland in our brains, and makes us feel positive.</p><p>\"We [humans] are absolutely highly social. We go to all the trouble to form communities, civilisations… and we have a physiology to make that work,\" says Carter. \"Oxytocin brings us together, and it helps us stay together.\" Oxytocin levels also increase with physical touch, for example through hugging and intercourse. \"The bonds that are formed during sex can be fairly powerful, especially and this is where the honeymoon effect occurs,\" says Carter. \"Especially during first sexual encounters, even if they're not physical.\"</p><p>There might be something to be said for our body temperature, too. There are biological differences between men and women in how they feel hot or cold – women typically have more fat between their skin and muscles, preventing heat from reaching the skin and extremities (hands, feet and the tip of the nose), and they tend to have a slower metabolic rate than men which slows down heat production. \"And so in the winter, you know, it might be more of a case of 'I would like to have somebody that helps keep my extremities warm',\" Nelson says. \"I mean, it could be a subconscious thought process, but that might be the case.\"</p><p>If anything else, cuffing season could teach us something about \"our relationship with relationships\" as Garcia puts it. In particular, he argues that our families play an important role in our quest to find romance. As we're surrounded by family and friends, people may have time to reflect, and ask themselves: what kind of person do I want to come home with for the festive period?</p><p>Family and kin are involved in our mating and dating more than any other species on this planet, Garcia says. \"There's a lot of family pressure, even if it's not explicit pressure,\" he says. \"Being around family and friends reminds us that there is this expectation of partnering and family formation. It's really uniquely human in that sense.\"</p><p>So, is there any science to cuffing season? I'm not totally convinced. As the experts point out, human mating desires and behaviours aren't seasonal, so it seems more of a social and cultural pattern than anything else, despite the contentious psychology. But maybe you feel differently.</p><p>And by the looks of the modern dating scene, Gen Z and millennials in particular are re-evaluating what romantic relationships mean to them. Dating trends come and go – just take the dwindling popularity of dating apps as an example. While it may have once been exciting to swipe through hundreds of budding singles in your local area, a Forbes survey published in summer 2025 reported that 78% of dating app users in the US were facing burnout.</p><p>Regardless, we're seeing massive changes in dating culture, Garcia says. \"I think part of the issue is this sort of over-focus on self-actualisation. I think we're seeing, particularly with young people, this idea that they have to work on themselves before they can be in a relationship.\"</p><p>Remember, humans are social creatures. \"You mature in a relationship, you make mistakes, and you figure out what you are and what you want in a relationship. They [relationships] are the vessel for that,\" Garcia says.</p><p>In which case, maybe I should get swiping. But realistically, I am more of an off-the-cuff kind of person anyway.</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p></p><p>Rollercoasters send our hearts racing and stomachs dropping.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump’s political retribution campaign just took two embarrassing steps back and one giant leap forward.</p><p>The collapse of criminal cases against former FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James raised questions about the Justice Department’s competence after a judge ruled Trump’s handpicked prosecutor was illegally appointed amid rushed prosecutions under political pressure.</p><p>But the administration didn’t miss a beat after its twin defeat on Monday. The Pentagon swiftly announced a probe into and potential court martial of war hero, NASA astronaut and Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over a video in which he and colleagues pointed out that members of the military don’t have to obey illegal orders.</p><p>This followed Trump’s claim last week that Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers in the video, all military or intelligence community veterans, had committed sedition — inciting an insurrection against the state — which Trump said was punishable by death.</p><p>Trump has made no secret of his determination to use presidential power to prosecute his opponents in revenge for his own criminal indictments — it was a pillar of his 2024 presidential campaign. But the use of the military to target a political foe crosses a new line and invokes the possibility that the free speech of veterans could be constrained if they criticize the commander in chief.</p><p>It also marks an extension of Trump’s attempt to use government institutions to weaponize justice against his opponents, a process that the Comey and James cases show is already advanced in the DOJ.</p><p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has already dismissed senior military officers in an attempt to build a team he believes is loyal to the president and his own ethos of unfettered discretion for “war fighters.” He has also fired top legal officers who raised questions about the legality of administration policies, CNN reported.</p><p>The extraordinary possibility that a decorated retired Navy captain such as Kelly could be called back to duty to be prosecuted under military justice threatens to take the process further.</p><p>“What Trump wants to say is, ‘If I can come after him, I can come after anyone,’” said Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Independent Veterans of America.</p><p>“This is crossing the Rubicon,” Rieckhoff told CNN’s John Berman on “Anderson Cooper 360.” “The idea you can drive (Kelly) back onto active duty and threaten a court martial … is breaking glass that has never been broken before in the modern military.”</p><p>Since Kelly was a senior officer who retired from the Navy, he is required by law to remain available for recall to the military. The Pentagon said it could take him back into the service to carry out a court martial or administrative punishment. It was not immediately clear what potential charges might be viable against Kelly, since his alleged offense was to point out a fact — that military officers are only obligated to follow legal orders under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p><p>There must be considerable doubt that a case against Kelly would get anywhere near the court martial stage, not least because a conviction would set a precedent that any retired member of the military could be pursued by the government in perpetuity for remarks construed as criticism of the president’s actions.</p><p>The video by Democratic lawmakers has sparked debate over whether they were needlessly dragging the military into political disputes with a campaign-style stunt. But it did not take place in a vacuum. Trump has ordered reservists and US Marines into US cities in deployments that some judges have blocked. And many experts believe that the administration’s strikes on the speedboats of alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific thwart due process and could infringe US and international law and the Constitution.</p><p>Trump’s political strategy is clear. With his prosecutions against Comey, James and now investigation into Kelly, he’s using the power of the executive branch to target political opponents. These are acts of a president who takes his political beefs deeply personally and believes, erroneously, that his role comes with unlimited executive power.</p><p>Some Republicans insist his targets are fair game. They argue that some or all of Trump’s criminal indictments, including for election interference, a felony conviction and civil legal problems were examples of Democratic “lawfare” and that he’s justified in responding.</p><p>It’s fair to debate whether some of the prosecutions were politically motivated and the strength of the legal theories behind them. But Trump was convicted by a jury of his peers in the New York hush money case, and there was substantial evidence he tried to overthrow the result of the 2020 election. Trump denied wrongdoing in all cases against him.</p><p>And the president’s social media posts reveal the political axe he’s grinding. The Comey and James indictments quickly followed a social media post, which may have been intended to be private, to Attorney General Pam Bondi, demanding prosecutions. And news of the Kelly investigation followed days after Trump’s social media outburst against the Democratic lawmakers who made the video.</p><p>Hegseth issued a statement Monday that appeared to be designed to catch the president’s eye with its amped-up language. “The video made by the ‘Seditious Six’ was despicable, reckless, and false. Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of ‘good order and discipline.’ Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion — which only puts our warriors in danger,” he wrote.</p><p>The lawmakers in the video did not directly encourage US military personnel to ignore the orders of their commanders. This argument would only work if the commanders issued an unlawful order. The video pointed out that military members can or must refuse illegal orders or those that violate the Constitution.</p><p>The legality of an order is often a tough call in the heat of combat. That’s why members of the Judge Advocate General’s Corps — military lawyers — are often attached to units to provide legal counsel to active-duty personnel, sometimes in combat situations. Every member of the military is trained in their legal obligations. Supporters of the Democratic lawmakers in the video argue they were merely stating that everyone in the military has an obligation to obey the law — hardly a heinous offense.</p><p>Kelly said that if the intent was to intimidate him, “it won’t work.” He added, in a statement on X: “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”</p><p>Successful prosecutions of Kelly, Comey or James seem unlikely. But being ensnared by legal wrangles can be traumatic and financially ruinous. “The process is the punishment,” Miles Taylor, a former government homeland security official who is being investigated by the DOJ after criticizing Trump during his first term, told CNN’s Kasie Hunt.</p><p>The White House reacted to its losses in the Comey and James cases as it always does: by doubling down on accusations and vows to appeal, and by implying that any judge who rules against the president is negligent or politicized. “I know the Department of Justice will be appealing this in very short order, so maybe James Comey should pump the brakes on his victory lap,” said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p><p>A federal judge dismissed the cases after finding that Trump’s appointment of former White House official Lindsey Halligan as interim US attorney in Alexandria, Virginia, was invalid. The president named Halligan amid a rush to bring the criminal indictments.</p><p>Comey pleaded not guilty to lying to and obstructing Congress during testimony in late 2020. James, who said in her campaign for attorney general that she would investigate Trump over his business dealings, secured a civil court fraud judgement against the president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization in September 2023. She has pleaded not guilty in a mortgage fraud case brought by the administration.</p><p>The legal and constitutional obligations of Monday’s legal drama will take time to play out. But the political reverberations were immediate.</p><p>Kelly, for example, is seen as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate who appeals to moderates in the party. He has strong credentials as a senator from a border state and because of his military record. He did not waste any time sending out multiple fundraising emails after the news, telling supporters, “The Department of War is coming after me because they don’t like what I have to say.”</p><p>Like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker — other potential Democratic presidential candidates — Kelly now has a fight with the administration and a platform to show the kind of defiance toward Trump that his party’s voters crave.</p><p>The politics of the showdown may also backfire on the president. After all, a commander in chief who never served in the military is now using his power in pursuit of a hero who flew combat jets off a US carrier over Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War and who showed the right stuff by blasting into space on shuttle missions.</p><p>Kelly implicitly made the contrast in his statement. “When I was 22 years old, I commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy and swore an oath to the Constitution. I upheld that oath through flight school, multiple deployments on the USS Midway, 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm, test pilot school, four space shuttle flights at NASA, and every day since I retired – which I did after my wife Gabby was shot in the head while serving her constituents,” Kelly said.</p><p>The Arizona senator is married to Gabrielle Giffords, a former Democratic member of the House who was shot at a political event in 2011 and left with a severe brain injury.</p><p>While Trump has always prospered politically when he’s picked fights and singled out political foes — at least with his ever-loyal base voters — he has wider problems than his personal grievances. He’s struggling to show empathy to voters struggling with the high prices of groceries and housing. The White House on Monday postponed an expected announcement on a new health care proposal as millions of Americans are seeing spiking premiums. Trump’s approval ratings have tumbled, and the surprise resignation of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a fervent supporter, exposed splits in the MAGA movement.</p><p>And as many Republicans anticipate next year’s midterm elections with trepidation as voters demand help, their president is obsessing over ancient personal feuds — including the one with Comey, which stretches back nearly a decade.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.</p><p>The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.</p><p>His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his second album.</p><p>Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.</p><p>US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.</p><p>Thomas King, whose works centered around indigenous stories, said he feels as though he's \"been ripped in half\" after learning he is not part Cherokee.</p><p>The trial in Dresden comes shortly after the US designated the Antifa Ost group as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Airlines are told to resume flights to Venezuela within 48 hours or risk losing their clearance to fly there.</p><p>Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites.</p><p>The executive order calls for a report into whether to label the group a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>A plume of volcanic ash from Ethiopia has swept across the Red Sea through Oman and Yemen and reached Delhi, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said.</p><p>The eruption of the Hayli Gubbi volcano in Ethiopia - which was dormant for several thousand years - began on Sunday morning, sending an ash column thousands of feet into the atmosphere.</p><p>Several flights have been cancelled, delayed or rerouted in India because of the ash, with the country's aviation regulator asking airlines to \"strictly avoid\" affected areas.</p><p>The level of ash contamination is unclear, experts said, but it is unlikely to affect Delhi's air quality, which was \"very poor\" as per official readings on Tuesday.</p><p>Volcanic ash is a cloud of tiny, abrasive particles released into the atmosphere during an eruption. It can damage aircraft engines, contaminate airfields and reduce visibility, making it hazardous to flight operations.</p><p>\"The affected altitude is between 8.5km (5.2 miles) and 15km above the sea level,\" Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of IMD, told the BBC.</p><p>\"It will temporarily affect satellite functions and flight operations. But it is unlikely to affect weather conditions or air quality. It reached northern India last night and seems to be headed towards China,\" Mr Mohapatra said.</p><p>According Skymet Weather, a private agency, it is difficult to predict how long the ash will take to disperse, but IMD estimates that Delhi's skies should clear out by Tuesday evening.</p><p>Aircraft operations have been disrupted as a result of the ash, with Air India cancelling 11 flights, while carriers such as IndiGo, Akasa Air and KLM also reportedly affected.</p><p>In a statement on X, IndiGo said it was tracking the situation \"in coordination with international aviation bodies\".</p><p>Mumbai Airport has asked passengers to check the status of their flights before leaving for the airport.</p><p>India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued an advisory to flight operators asking pilots to immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine performance anomalies or cabin smoke or odour.</p><p>The advisory also directs carriers to inspect aircraft operating near affected zones, and \"suspend or delay operations to impacted airports if conditions deteriorate\".</p><p>There are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.</p><p>The level of contamination in this instance is unclear.</p><p>\"Measuring contamination caused by volcanic eruptions take a lot of preparation. Sensors have to be deployed in advance. This particular volcanic eruption did not provide any room for preparation. So the level of contamination is not known,\" GP Sharma, president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather said.</p><p>Professor Atalay Ayele of Addis Ababa University told the BBC that the eruption stood out because the volcano had been dormant for thousands of years.</p><p>He said it had been unusually noisy but had not triggered significant seismic activity. The Hayli Gubbi volcano lies close to the Erta Ale, an area known for its active volcanic spots.</p><p>Volcanic ash clouds are rare. But when Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted in 2010, it caused global travel chaos.

{"details":"<p>A federal judge on Monday dismissed the prosecutions that President Donald Trump orchestrated against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James – a major early setback to his retribution campaign against his political foes.</p><p>US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that the cases were invalid because the prosecutor who brought the charges, interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan, had been unlawfully appointed.</p><p>The rulings bolster criticisms of how hastily the prosecutions were brought.</p><p>Halligan was installed and brought the cases after Trump forced out the existing US attorney who resisted bringing the cases and pleaded with Attorney General Pam Bondi to make them happen.</p><p>The opinions are subject to appeal. But for now, they close the first two major cases Trump orchestrated against his foes. And it could recast Trump’s fraught effort to exact retribution on his foes.</p><p>Trump’s role in pushing these prosecutions has no modern equivalent.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways from the rulings:</p><p>The pervading picture of Trump’s retribution campaign has been that he just wants his foes indicted, and he doesn’t really care how or what for.</p><p>But as I wrote early on, that was a recipe for hastily orchestrated indictments that might ultimately backfire politically – by falling apart in ways that reinforce just how desperate and politicized they were.</p><p>These ones are clearly at risk of backfiring.</p><p>We already knew that Trump played an extraordinary role in making these cases happen. Now a judge has ruled that Trump and Bondi basically had to illegally try to install a replacement interim US attorney to get someone to pursue these cases.</p><p>READ: Federal judge’s orders to dismiss cases against James Comey and Letitia James</p><p>The James and Comey opinions both begin with the judge citing how Halligan had “no prior prosecutorial experience.” The judge also dinged Bondi for trying to retroactively give Halligan different status, saying “the Government has identified no authority allowing the Attorney General to reach back in time and rewrite the terms of a past appointment.”</p><p>And that comes after plenty of other developments that seemed to reinforce how haphazard all this was.</p><p>At the start of last week, a magistrate judge dinged Halligan and the DOJ for “a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps,” which included possibly showing the grand jury privileged evidence and/or giving it false instructions. Later in the week, matters focused on Halligan’s strange handling of the indictments and whether she actually showed the final indictment to the full grand jury.</p><p>Indeed, it seems like the case could have been dismissed for a number of different reasons; this just happened to be the one to get resolved first.</p><p>And it’s not as if these rulings came out of nowhere. Even some conservative legal scholars predicted that these indictments would fall apart over issues with Halligan’s appointment.</p><p>There is real political risk here for the White House.</p><p>Trump’s allies have pitched these indictments as more or less akin to Trump’s indictments – a legal tit-for-tat after Trump was indicted for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, for retaining classified documents and for hush money payments.</p><p>But Americans don’t see them that way.</p><p>A Marquette University Law School poll last week showed Americans said by 16 points (58%-42%) that the cases against Trump’s foes were not justified. That’s even as they said by 10 points that the indictments against then-former President Trump were justified.</p><p>That was not the first poll to suggest Americans see these indictments as more politicized and less substantial than Trump’s.</p><p>Trump as a candidate last year repeatedly claimed that Democrats were weaponizing the justice system against him. He baselessly claimed then-President Joe Biden was behind his indictments and spoke of retribution. “Sometimes revenge can be justified,” Trump said last year after he was convicted in the Manhattan hush money case.</p><p>Trump’s indictments also involved an attempt to overturn a democratic election and involved the violent January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, as well withholding sensitive documents that could jeopardize national security.</p><p>The indictments of Comey and James were much more small-bore: Comey for alleged false statements to Congress and James for alleged mortgage fraud that, even if proven, would only have gained her thousands of dollars over many years.</p><p>Supreme Court pauses lower court order that blocked Texas’ new congressional maps</p><p>And this isn’t the only major recent setback for the Justice Department.</p><p>Last week, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas led a panel that struck down a GOP-drawn map that could net Republicans a five-seat gain in Congress. The judges cited an apparently ill-advised Justice Department letter that suggested the map needed to be redrawn for racial reason – a letter Texas officials soon sought to disown. (The Supreme Court has since allowed the map to stay, at least temporarily while it considers the matter.)</p><p>The Justice Department also moved last week to suddenly dismiss its much-hyped prosecution of a woman, Miramar Martinez, it claimed had rammed a Border Patrol agent with her car, after some apparent missteps.</p><p>We also learned last week that investigators are probing the administration’s handling of the mortgage-fraud investigations of James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California. Prosecutors were looking into whether grand jury materials were shared with unauthorized people, according to sources.</p><p>Trump has also faced two rulings against his signature tariffs policy, with the Supreme Court currently considering whether to uphold those rulings – and the justices appearing skeptical of his claims to authority.</p><p>And on Friday, a high-ranking official from Costa Rica in comments to The Washington Post contradicted a claim the Justice Department had made in court.</p><p>The big question now is what happens next. Does Trump press forward on his retribution campaign? Or does the administration recognize it’s not going well – or recognize the hurdles are too large – and decide to cut its losses?</p><p>That starts with whether they try to resurrect these cases.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the decisions would be appealed “very soon.” Bondi also said at a Monday press conference that the Justice Department will take “all available legal action,” including an “immediate appeal,” to address the decision.</p><p>Beyond that, the judge also dismissed these cases “without prejudice.” That means the administration could try to bring the same cases in new indictments, provided it can find legally appointed prosecutors willing to do so.</p><p>The administration might reason that the Halligan rulings were unique to her – rather than a reflection of its evidence – and it can still press forward.</p><p>But that could be difficult in the Comey case, given the statute of limitations expired on September 30.</p><p>And history suggests getting a willing prosecutor could be a difficult exercise, as could getting another grand jury to indict.</p><p>If the judge’s ruling stands, it’s not clear what path exists to getting a Trump-friendly US attorney who would actually bring these cases installed. The administration could attempt a workaround to install Halligan, but that carries no guarantee of success. Otherwise you’ll have a US attorney appointed by the district court, or a Senate-confirmed US attorney. (Senate confirmation, however, that takes some time and is subject to “blue slip” approval by Virginia’s Democratic senators – another norm that Trump is trying to convince Republicans to let him skip).</p><p>Beyond that, there is no guarantee that another grand jury would sign off on charges like Comey’s. The grand jury in that case only narrowly approved the charges, and it actually rejected one of them – an extremely rare occurrence, given the standard of evidence is much lower than in a jury trial.</p><p>While these cases differ from Trump’s indictments for reasons mentioned above, their dismissals certainly echo one of Trump’s.</p><p>In fact, they do so quite literally.</p><p>The judge in explaining her reasoning quotes from US District Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of Trump’s classified documents case. In that case, Cannon, an appointee of Trump during his first term, found that special counsel Jack Smith had been unlawfully appointed.</p><p>In ruling that every action that flowed from Halligan’s appointment was unlawful, Currie cited Cannon’s ruling in United States v. Trump which said there was “no alternative course to cure the unconstitutional problem.”</p><p>This story has been updated with additional information.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

{"details":"<p>The controversial, US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says it is winding down its aid operations in the Palestinian territory, after almost six months.</p><p>The organisation had already suspended its three food distribution sites in Gaza after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect six weeks ago.</p><p>The GHF aimed to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Gaza's population. UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.</p><p>Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.</p><p>The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.</p><p>The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".</p><p>US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"</p><p>Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.</p><p>A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.</p><p>\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.</p><p>The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.</p><p>The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.</p><p>The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.</p><p>The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.</p><p>The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.</p><p>The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.</p><p>It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.</p><p>UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".</p><p>He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.</p><p>Thomas King, whose works centered around indigenous stories, said he feels as though he's \"been ripped in half\" after learning he is not part Cherokee.</p><p>The trial in Dresden comes shortly after the US designated the Antifa Ost group as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Airlines are told to resume flights to Venezuela within 48 hours or risk losing their clearance to fly there.</p><p>The executive order calls for a report into whether to label the group a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Marven's mother and sister could be sent back to gang-ravaged Haiti as a US protection scheme ends.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

There are solid results, and much work still lies ahead,” Zelensky added.</p><p></p><p>After being blindsided by the original 28-point peace plan that emerged last week, Europe on Monday put forward a counterproposal that struck out some of the provisions seen to favor Russia. This was obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources.</p><p>Starmer is due to hold a call of the “Coalition of the Willing,” later today, as Ukraine’s allies take stock of the recent diplomacy and discuss the amended peace plan.</p><p>“We have coordinated our positions and the priority issues for discussion, as well as some of our next steps and contacts,” Zelensky said of the meeting.</p><p>US President Donald Trump’s push for an end to the war in Ukraine is motivated by his desire for a win, CNN’s European Affairs Commentator Dominic Thomas says.</p><p>“We’ve seen President Trump vacillate from unambiguous support for President Zelensky to a more lukewarm approach to him,” Thomas told Elex Michaelson on CNN’s The Story Is today. “Ultimately what he’s interested in is a win, is a peace treaty that he can take responsibility for.”</p><p></p><p>But Thomas said a sustained peace would only be possible were Russian President Vladimir Putin held accountable for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“That peace treaty will not be worth the paper it’s signed on unless there is recognition that the invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory is a violation of international law,” he added.</p><p>While Thomas said Trump’s “lack of consistency” had “undermined the process,” of implementing peace, he added the president’s presence is “absolutely incontrovertible.”</p><p>Moldova said six drones had crossed into its airspace Tuesday morning, during Russia’s long-range strikes on Ukraine.</p><p>Moldova’s government said the first drone to violate its airspace was detected close to Vulcănești, near the borders with Ukraine and Romania, and that five more drones were detected across the country.</p><p>One of the drones fell on the roof of a house in northern Moldova, the government said.</p><p>In neighboring Romania, NATO also scrambled fighter jets after at least one Russian drone entered its airspace overnight into Tuesday.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that an amended peace plan for Ukraine must reflect the “spirit and letter” of the talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump during their summit in Alaska in August.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said Russia had welcomed the original version of the peace plan, which surfaced last week and was seen as heavily favoring Moscow. Following US-Ukraine talks in Switzerland, the original 28-point plan has since been pared back to a 19-point plan, which has reportedly removed some of the provisions deemed unacceptable by Kyiv.</p><p>Lavrov accused Europe and Ukraine of trying to “twist” the original plan, which had been backed by US President Donald Trump, and said Russia was waiting to receive the amended version from the US.</p><p>“If the spirit and letter of Anchorage are lost in the key understandings we have documented, then of course the situation will be fundamentally different. But so far, I repeat, no one has officially communicated anything to us,” he said.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said Tuesday that the initial 28-point peace plan, which emerged last week and was widely criticized as being favorable to Moscow, could be a “good basis” for talks about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The 28-point plan, first reported last week by Axios, demanded that Ukraine cede territory to Russia, limit the size of its military, and abandon its ambition to join NATO. But following talks between the US and Ukraine in Switzerland, that plan has since been pared back to a 19-point peace deal more favorable to Kyiv, and some of the most difficult issues have been stripped out, a senior Ukrainian official told the Financial Times Monday.</p><p>The Kremlin has since said it favors the initial plan, which US President Donald Trump initially gave Ukraine less than a week to accept. That deadline has since appeared to be shelved.</p><p>“Trump’s plan is currently the only substantive one, and it could serve as a good basis for negotiations,” the Kremlin said.</p><p>It claimed that the draft of this plan was “based on the understandings reached” between the US and Russia during a summit in Alaska in August.</p><p>But the origins of the 28-point peace plan have been disputed. A US Senator described the plan as a Russian “wish list,” and analysts pointed out that the text contained several potential Russianisms, raising questions about which side wrote the draft. However, the State Department has insisted that the plan was authored by the US, “with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians.”</p><p>The Kremlin said Tuesday that there was an “information frenzy” around the peace plan, “with many contradictory data and statements.”</p><p>There is a “slim chance” that a peace deal will be achieved during this phase of negotiations, according to an executive director at a Ukrainian security think tank.</p><p>Speaking to CNN’s Rosemary Church on Newsroom Tuesday, Alexander Khara, from the Centre for Defence Strategies, cast doubt over a Russia-Ukraine truce, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambition for widespread power as an obstacle.</p><p>Khara said Putin was “not willing to compromise” because Moscow wants “not just to control Ukraine but convert their losses into some geo-political gains in Europe and elsewhere.” He added that Russia had been using diplomacy as “a tool of war.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Khara said he believes Trump was “not interested” in Ukraine or the European continent, “So that’s why the war will go on,” he added.</p><p>“There is a slim chance of any peace deal coming out of this diplomatic activity,” he said.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today that he had “nothing to report” about US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll’s talks with Russian delegates in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>“We still have nothing to report. We are monitoring media reports and analyzing them carefully,” Peskov added.</p><p>The spokesperson said Moscow understands “some adjustments are being made to the previously published text,” referring to the 28-point plan to end the war that was leaked last week and which was broadly seen as being favorable to Russia.</p><p>“We understand that the text we unofficially received earlier has now been amended. But at some point, the time will probably come when we will establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information. For now, we have no new developments in this regard,” Peskov said.</p><p></p><p>For context: Driscoll, who now appears to be playing a prominent role in the peace talks, met with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine. Those talks are continuing today, a US official has told CNN.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could visit the United States in the next few days to finalize a peace deal with US President Donald Trump, a senior Ukrainian official has just said.</p><p>“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s national security chief, wrote on social media. “We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps.”</p><p>“We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine’s President to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Umerov said Ukraine appreciated the “productive and constructive” meetings with US officials in Switzerland, as well as Trump’s “steadfast efforts to end the war.”</p><p>The Trump administration’s 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine has been criticized as highly favorable to Russia.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European counterproposal, obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources, is much more in line with Ukraine’s wishes.</p><p>Here are some key differences:</p><p>On territorial concessions: The US plan says that Luhansk, Donetsk and occupied Crimea will all be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States. It also says that Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</p><p>The European draft differs starkly, according to the version obtained by Reuters. The text reads: “Ukraine commits not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means. Negotiations on territorial swaps will start from the Line of Contact.”</p><p>On NATO expansion: The draft US plan includes a provision that NATO will not expand further, and stipulates that Ukraine will agree to not join NATO.</p><p>The European draft removes those provisions, saying that “Ukraine joining NATO depends on consensus of NATO members,” according to the Reuters version. It notes that consensus does not currently exist, but the language leaves the door open.</p><p>On Ukraine’s military: The US plan notes that Ukraine’s Armed Forces “will be limited to 600,000 personnel.”</p><p>The European plan suggests that the Ukrainian military is “capped at 800,000 in peacetime.” On both drafts, Russia’s far larger army is not asked to make cuts.</p><p>On future elections: The US draft also calls for Ukraine to hold elections within 100 days of a sealed agreement – something that analysts say would be an impractically short window to allow for campaigning.</p><p>The European draft only says that elections should be held “as soon as possible” after an agreement is signed.</p><p>For context: It’s worth noting that there are several other versions of the European text that have been reported in American and British news outlets, which differ from the copy Reuters obtained. The US 28-point plan may also have evolved since its original version following top leaders’ discussions in Geneva.</p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN</p><p>As we’ve reported, Russia and Ukraine launched deadly strikes overnight, with both reporting deaths.</p><p>Russia’s strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv and targeted “the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p><p>The pictures below show the aftermath of the attack on Ukraine’s capital city.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine traded deadly attacks overnight, killing and wounding civilians and damaging infrastructure.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and 260 drones into Ukraine, killing six people and wounding 13, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>The strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv and targeted “the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going,” Zelensky said.</p><p>Ukraine, meanwhile, launched a major drone attack on Russia, killing three people and wounding eight, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry.</p><p>Russian forces intercepted and destroyed 249 Ukrainian drones, including 116 that were launched over the Black Sea, the ministry said. The strikes damaged residential buildings and homes in the Russian port city Novorossiysk, according to local officials.</p><p>The commander of Ukraine’s military drone unit, Robert Brovdi, hailed Tuesday as Kyiv’s “most productive” night in November, saying the drone attack did “deep damage” to Russia.</p><p>In Romania, NATO fighter jets were scrambled to protect its airspace as Russia attacked Ukraine overnight, according to Reuters. The jets took off after at least one Russian drone breached Romanian airspace near the border with Ukraine, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing Romania’s defense ministry.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and more than 460 drones into Ukraine overnight, killing six people and wounding 13, said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>The strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv, Zelensky said on social media on Tuesday.</p><p>“There is also destruction in the Odesa region – the ports, food supplies, and infrastructure were hit, with no military purpose whatsoever,” Zelensky said.</p><p></p><p>Russia also struck Dnipro, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Cherkasy regions, Zelensky added.</p><p>“The primary targets were the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going.”</p><p>Zelensky thanked Ukraine’s supporters and called on the international community to put “pressure” on Russia.</p><p>“What matters most now is that all partners move toward diplomacy together,” he said.</p><p></p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN.</p><p>Driscoll will continue the meetings today, which are meant to lay the groundwork for higher-level engagements, the official said.</p><p>The meetings follow days of intense diplomacy in Switzerland, where American and Ukrainian officials negotiated over the 28-point proposal, which was authored by the US with input from Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Svitlana Vlasova, Caitlin Danaher, Lauren Kent, Anna Chernova, Gul Tuysuz, Catherine Nicholls, Charlotte Reck, Michael Williams, Eve Brennan, Billy Stockwell, Morgan Rimmer, Lex Harvey and Donald Judd contributed reporting to this post.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

They have chosen a European destiny,” the EU chief concluded, adding that starts with Ukraine’s reconstruction and integration into Europe’s single market and defense industrial base.</p><p>CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova, Catherine Nicholls and Kara Fox contributed to this post.</p><p>Rescue workers have recovered the body of a man from under the rubble in northeastern Kyiv, Ukraine’s emergency services said Tuesday, bringing the death toll from the Russian strike on the Ukrainian capital to seven.</p><p>At least 13 others have been injured in the attacks, including a child.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and 260 drones into Ukraine overnight, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>Let’s catch you up on the main developments we’ve been reporting today, as peace talks involving the US, Ukraine and European allies aimed at ending the war in Ukraine continue.</p><p>• US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is holding talks in Abu Dhabi about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN.</p><p>• Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he had “nothing to report” about the talks, adding, “we are monitoring media reports and analyzing them carefully.”</p><p>• Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the amended peace plan must reflect the “spirit and letter” of the talks between Putin and Trump during their August summit in Alaska.</p><p>•  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are due to hold a call of the “Coalition of the Willing” later today, which will be an opportunity for Ukraine’s allies to discuss the amended plan and how they will proceed.</p><p>• Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine traded deadly attacks overnight, killing and wounding civilians and damaging infrastructure.</p><p>Speaking after a call today with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country sees “many prospects” for peace, following talks over the weekend with US officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Following the meetings in Geneva, we see many prospects that can make the path to peace real. There are solid results, and much work still lies ahead,” Zelensky added.</p><p></p><p>After being blindsided by the original 28-point peace plan that emerged last week, Europe on Monday put forward a counterproposal that struck out some of the provisions seen to favor Russia. This was obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources.</p><p>Starmer is due to hold a call of the “Coalition of the Willing,” later today, as Ukraine’s allies take stock of the recent diplomacy and discuss the amended peace plan.</p><p>“We have coordinated our positions and the priority issues for discussion, as well as some of our next steps and contacts,” Zelensky said of the meeting.</p><p>US President Donald Trump’s push for an end to the war in Ukraine is motivated by his desire for a win, CNN’s European Affairs Commentator Dominic Thomas says.</p><p>“We’ve seen President Trump vacillate from unambiguous support for President Zelensky to a more lukewarm approach to him,” Thomas told Elex Michaelson on CNN’s The Story Is today. “Ultimately what he’s interested in is a win, is a peace treaty that he can take responsibility for.”</p><p></p><p>But Thomas said a sustained peace would only be possible were Russian President Vladimir Putin held accountable for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“That peace treaty will not be worth the paper it’s signed on unless there is recognition that the invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory is a violation of international law,” he added.</p><p>While Thomas said Trump’s “lack of consistency” had “undermined the process,” of implementing peace, he added the president’s presence is “absolutely incontrovertible.”</p><p>Moldova said six drones had crossed into its airspace Tuesday morning, during Russia’s long-range strikes on Ukraine.</p><p>Moldova’s government said the first drone to violate its airspace was detected close to Vulcănești, near the borders with Ukraine and Romania, and that five more drones were detected across the country.</p><p>One of the drones fell on the roof of a house in northern Moldova, the government said.</p><p>In neighboring Romania, NATO also scrambled fighter jets after at least one Russian drone entered its airspace overnight into Tuesday.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that an amended peace plan for Ukraine must reflect the “spirit and letter” of the talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump during their summit in Alaska in August.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said Russia had welcomed the original version of the peace plan, which surfaced last week and was seen as heavily favoring Moscow. Following US-Ukraine talks in Switzerland, the original 28-point plan has since been pared back to a 19-point plan, which has reportedly removed some of the provisions deemed unacceptable by Kyiv.</p><p>Lavrov accused Europe and Ukraine of trying to “twist” the original plan, which had been backed by US President Donald Trump, and said Russia was waiting to receive the amended version from the US.</p><p>“If the spirit and letter of Anchorage are lost in the key understandings we have documented, then of course the situation will be fundamentally different. But so far, I repeat, no one has officially communicated anything to us,” he said.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said Tuesday that the initial 28-point peace plan, which emerged last week and was widely criticized as being favorable to Moscow, could be a “good basis” for talks about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The 28-point plan, first reported last week by Axios, demanded that Ukraine cede territory to Russia, limit the size of its military, and abandon its ambition to join NATO. But following talks between the US and Ukraine in Switzerland, that plan has since been pared back to a 19-point peace deal more favorable to Kyiv, and some of the most difficult issues have been stripped out, a senior Ukrainian official told the Financial Times Monday.</p><p>The Kremlin has since said it favors the initial plan, which US President Donald Trump initially gave Ukraine less than a week to accept. That deadline has since appeared to be shelved.</p><p>“Trump’s plan is currently the only substantive one, and it could serve as a good basis for negotiations,” the Kremlin said.</p><p>It claimed that the draft of this plan was “based on the understandings reached” between the US and Russia during a summit in Alaska in August.</p><p>But the origins of the 28-point peace plan have been disputed. A US Senator described the plan as a Russian “wish list,” and analysts pointed out that the text contained several potential Russianisms, raising questions about which side wrote the draft. However, the State Department has insisted that the plan was authored by the US, “with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians.”</p><p>The Kremlin said Tuesday that there was an “information frenzy” around the peace plan, “with many contradictory data and statements.”</p><p>There is a “slim chance” that a peace deal will be achieved during this phase of negotiations, according to an executive director at a Ukrainian security think tank.</p><p>Speaking to CNN’s Rosemary Church on Newsroom Tuesday, Alexander Khara, from the Centre for Defence Strategies, cast doubt over a Russia-Ukraine truce, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambition for widespread power as an obstacle.</p><p>Khara said Putin was “not willing to compromise” because Moscow wants “not just to control Ukraine but convert their losses into some geo-political gains in Europe and elsewhere.” He added that Russia had been using diplomacy as “a tool of war.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Khara said he believes Trump was “not interested” in Ukraine or the European continent, “So that’s why the war will go on,” he added.</p><p>“There is a slim chance of any peace deal coming out of this diplomatic activity,” he said.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today that he had “nothing to report” about US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll’s talks with Russian delegates in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>“We still have nothing to report. We are monitoring media reports and analyzing them carefully,” Peskov added.</p><p>The spokesperson said Moscow understands “some adjustments are being made to the previously published text,” referring to the 28-point plan to end the war that was leaked last week and which was broadly seen as being favorable to Russia.</p><p>“We understand that the text we unofficially received earlier has now been amended. But at some point, the time will probably come when we will establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information. For now, we have no new developments in this regard,” Peskov said.</p><p></p><p>For context: Driscoll, who now appears to be playing a prominent role in the peace talks, met with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine. Those talks are continuing today, a US official has told CNN.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could visit the United States in the next few days to finalize a peace deal with US President Donald Trump, a senior Ukrainian official has just said.</p><p>“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s national security chief, wrote on social media. “We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps.”</p><p>“We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine’s President to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Umerov said Ukraine appreciated the “productive and constructive” meetings with US officials in Switzerland, as well as Trump’s “steadfast efforts to end the war.”</p><p>The Trump administration’s 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine has been criticized as highly favorable to Russia.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European counterproposal, obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources, is much more in line with Ukraine’s wishes.</p><p>Here are some key differences:</p><p>On territorial concessions: The US plan says that Luhansk, Donetsk and occupied Crimea will all be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States. It also says that Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</p><p>The European draft differs starkly, according to the version obtained by Reuters. The text reads: “Ukraine commits not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means. Negotiations on territorial swaps will start from the Line of Contact.”</p><p>On NATO expansion: The draft US plan includes a provision that NATO will not expand further, and stipulates that Ukraine will agree to not join NATO.</p><p>The European draft removes those provisions, saying that “Ukraine joining NATO depends on consensus of NATO members,” according to the Reuters version. It notes that consensus does not currently exist, but the language leaves the door open.</p><p>On Ukraine’s military: The US plan notes that Ukraine’s Armed Forces “will be limited to 600,000 personnel.”</p><p>The European plan suggests that the Ukrainian military is “capped at 800,000 in peacetime.” On both drafts, Russia’s far larger army is not asked to make cuts.</p><p>On future elections: The US draft also calls for Ukraine to hold elections within 100 days of a sealed agreement – something that analysts say would be an impractically short window to allow for campaigning.</p><p>The European draft only says that elections should be held “as soon as possible” after an agreement is signed.</p><p>For context: It’s worth noting that there are several other versions of the European text that have been reported in American and British news outlets, which differ from the copy Reuters obtained. The US 28-point plan may also have evolved since its original version following top leaders’ discussions in Geneva.</p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN</p><p>As we’ve reported, Russia and Ukraine launched deadly strikes overnight, with both reporting deaths.</p><p>Russia’s strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv and targeted “the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p><p>The pictures below show the aftermath of the attack on Ukraine’s capital city.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine traded deadly attacks overnight, killing and wounding civilians and damaging infrastructure.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and 260 drones into Ukraine, killing six people and wounding 13, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>The strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv and targeted “the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going,” Zelensky said.</p><p>Ukraine, meanwhile, launched a major drone attack on Russia, killing three people and wounding eight, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry.</p><p>Russian forces intercepted and destroyed 249 Ukrainian drones, including 116 that were launched over the Black Sea, the ministry said. The strikes damaged residential buildings and homes in the Russian port city Novorossiysk, according to local officials.</p><p>The commander of Ukraine’s military drone unit, Robert Brovdi, hailed Tuesday as Kyiv’s “most productive” night in November, saying the drone attack did “deep damage” to Russia.</p><p>In Romania, NATO fighter jets were scrambled to protect its airspace as Russia attacked Ukraine overnight, according to Reuters. The jets took off after at least one Russian drone breached Romanian airspace near the border with Ukraine, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing Romania’s defense ministry.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and more than 460 drones into Ukraine overnight, killing six people and wounding 13, said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>The strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv, Zelensky said on social media on Tuesday.</p><p>“There is also destruction in the Odesa region – the ports, food supplies, and infrastructure were hit, with no military purpose whatsoever,” Zelensky said.</p><p></p><p>Russia also struck Dnipro, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Cherkasy regions, Zelensky added.</p><p>“The primary targets were the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going.”</p><p>Zelensky thanked Ukraine’s supporters and called on the international community to put “pressure” on Russia.</p><p>“What matters most now is that all partners move toward diplomacy together,” he said.</p><p></p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN.</p><p>Driscoll will continue the meetings today, which are meant to lay the groundwork for higher-level engagements, the official said.</p><p>The meetings follow days of intense diplomacy in Switzerland, where American and Ukrainian officials negotiated over the 28-point proposal, which was authored by the US with input from Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Svitlana Vlasova, Caitlin Danaher, Lauren Kent, Anna Chernova, Gul Tuysuz, Catherine Nicholls, Charlotte Reck, Michael Williams, Eve Brennan, Billy Stockwell, Morgan Rimmer, Lex Harvey and Donald Judd contributed reporting to this post.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>From 10 December, social media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.</p><p>The government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\".</p><p>A study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.</p><p>One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.</p><p>The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.</p><p>It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord have recently introduced age checks on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban.</p><p>The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p>These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p>YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.</p><p>Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.</p><p>The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.</p><p>Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.</p><p>The government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.</p><p>Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has announced it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said.</p><p>Snapchat has said users can use bank accounts or photo IDs to verify their age or take a selfie, which will be used to estimate their age.</p><p>The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.</p><p>Without a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.</p><p>The government's own report found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.</p><p>Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".</p><p>Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.</p><p>Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.</p><p>Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\".</p><p>\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"</p><p>Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages.</p><p>Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.</p><p>But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches.</p><p>It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p><p>Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy.</p><p>They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.</p><p>YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.</p><p>Even as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\".</p><p>At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it.</p><p>Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.</p><p>The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p>In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p>Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a French parliamentary enquiry recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p>Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p>Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p><p>Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p>Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p>Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules.</p><p>England will face tournament debutants Italy at the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup while defending champions India and Pakistan will renew their rivalry in the group stage.</p><p>But critics say the regulator's new measures need to be the law rather than guidelines to make the internet safer for women and girls.</p><p>\"Jane\", from north-east England, tells how she lost her inheritance in an elaborate 18-month scam.</p><p>Olly's Work aims to raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime and online bullying.</p><p>Pauline Hanson was accused of 'blatant racism' after donning a burka as she pushed for a ban on the garment.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy,  moved many Americans over the weekend with her emotional essay about being diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after giving birth to her second child.</p><p>In the New Yorker, the 35-year-old stunned readers, writing that she was battling acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer, and had less than a year to live.</p><p>Doctors and researchers say the essay helped raise awareness about the deadly illness and critical need for more funding and research to tackle treatment-resistant cancers.</p><p>\"It's such an obviously moving and courageous essay,\" said Vijay Sankaran, a physician with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. \"She comes from a very prominent family, and yet anybody can be affected by cancer, even people who are young, who are seemingly healthy.\"</p><p>In the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood, Schlossberg said she was diagnosed  after doctors noticed an abnormally high white-blood cell count after giving birth to her daughter in May 2024.</p><p>The daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, she said she was shocked by the diagnosis, as she considered herself \"one of the healthiest people I knew\".</p><p>One of the dangers of acute myeloid leukaemias is that they can emerge suddenly, going from being undetactable to affecting hundreds of cells in a matter of days, said Dr Sankaran.</p><p>The cancer - affecting both the bone marrow and blood - is rare, sickening four in 100,000 adults each year.</p><p>Schlossberg's subtype of leukaemia - a chromosomal abnormality formerly called Inversion 3 - is even rarer, affecting only 1% to 2% of people with acute myeloid leukaemia.</p><p>The rare genetic mutation makes Schlossberg's cancer even more dangerous. It is one of the few subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia for which there are few effective therapies - meaning remissions or cures \"are the minority\", said Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukaemia at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>The most common treatments involve bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy and clinical trials.</p><p>Schlossberg tried them all.</p><p>She described in her essay the transplant doctors drained from her sister's arms and chemotherapy that made her once \"great hair\" fall out.</p><p>She joined a clinical trial for CAR-T-cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy for certain blood cancers, in which she said scientists \"engineered my sister's T-cells, directing them to attack my cancer cells\".</p><p>Though the therapy has been revolutionary for other types of leukaemia, it is less so for acute myeloid leukaemia, Dr Sankaran said.</p><p>In the last clinical trial, her doctor told Schlossberg that he could \"keep me alive for a year, maybe\".</p><p>She also discussed battling cancer while watching her cousin, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, make massive cuts to research funding, including for cancers. She and other family members are ardent critics of Kennedy since his unsuccessful presidential campaign and nomination for the health role.</p><p>\"As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,\" Schlossberg wrote.</p><p>Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, announced in August that he was pulling the funding over claims that \"mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits\" for certain respiratory viruses. He also revoked funding for hundreds of research grants through the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>Even though cuts to mRNA funding were only for respiratory viruses, they have had a chilling effect in the entire mRNA research community, said Jeff Coller, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University focused on RNA therapeutics.</p><p>\"We've seen that researchers are, quite frankly, afraid to put together proposals for clinical trials that would be using mRNAs. And we call these cancer vaccines,\" he said.</p><p>The NIH was once a global leader in funding for biomedical research, but that has changed this year, Dr Sankaran said.</p><p>\"That's been limiting, because you could just imagine you need to take more shots on goal to actually have research that will successfully lead to therapies,\" he said.</p><p>Schlossberg's battle - while having access to the best care as a member of a prominent American family - highlights the need for more funding to develop better screening tools and treatments for all patients, physicians said.</p><p>\"[Schlossberg] continues to have a poor prognosis with even the best available tools that we have, and so I think it just really emphasizes our need to do better for many of our patients,\" Dr Sankaran said.</p><p>Thomas King, whose works centered around indigenous stories, said he feels as though he's \"been ripped in half\" after learning he is not part Cherokee.</p><p>The trial in Dresden comes shortly after the US designated the Antifa Ost group as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Airlines are told to resume flights to Venezuela within 48 hours or risk losing their clearance to fly there.</p><p>Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites.</p><p>The executive order calls for a report into whether to label the group a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>The prisoners of war come from all corners of the world: Kenya, Nepal, Tajikistan, to name a few. Speaking different languages and coming from diverse cultures, they have one thing in common – they say they were deceived by Russia into joining a war they did not want to fight.</p><p>Nearly 200 foreigners from 37 countries have been captured fighting for Russia and are currently held as prisoners of war by Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of the deception, bribery and blackmail they say Moscow is using to lure foreigners into joining its military.</p><p>As Russia continues to struggle to recruit its own people to fight in Ukraine, it is increasingly turning to foreigners to bolster its military.</p><p>Brigadier General Dmitry Usov, who heads the POW headquarters, said Ukraine has identified more than 18,000 foreigners from 128 countries and territories who fought or are currently fighting for Russia in Ukraine – a number that does not include the thousands of North Korean soldiers sent to fight for Russia as part of a military cooperation agreement between the two countries. The actual number of foreigners fighting for Russia is likely much higher.</p><p>The rise in the number of foreigners found fighting in Ukraine has recently prompted several countries to issue strongly worded appeals to Russia to stop recruiting their citizens.</p><p>Earlier this month, Kenya’s President William Ruto said that his government was concerned “over young Kenyans who have been illegally recruited to fight in the war.”</p><p>Ukraine faces losing dignity or US support with Trump’s plan to end war, Zelensky says</p><p>On the same day, South Africa’s government said it would investigate how 17 of its citizens ended up fighting in the war after the men sent distress calls for help to return home from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, most of which is under Russian military control.</p><p>A day after that, Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, said 44 Indian nationals were fighting for Russia, adding that the Indian government has “once again taken up the matter with the Russian authorities to have them released at the earliest, and also to put an end to this practice.” He said the Indian authorities were taking steps to prevent people from being “tricked into joining.”</p><p>The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence told CNN the number of foreigners found on the front lines in Ukraine has been growing year-on-year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022 but has increased significantly this year. The number of foreigners taken prisoner by Ukrainian troops in the first nine months of this year was double that of the whole of last year, which was itself five times the 2023 figure, according to Kyiv.</p><p>CNN has asked the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Military for comment, but has received no answer. Moscow has previously denied coercing foreigners to enlist.</p><p>Moscow is fighting a brutal, grinding war in Ukraine. Its military continues to inch forward, most recently towards the eastern city of Pokrovsk, but this progress comes at a huge cost.</p><p>Neither Russia nor Ukraine release casualty data, but Moscow stopped publishing even the most basic mortality and demographic data earlier this year, most likely to disguise the real cost of the war, analysts say.</p><p>But Western intelligence agencies believe Russia has suffered more than 1 million casualties, including more than 250,000 deaths, since February 2022. In its most recent estimate, the United Kingdom’s Defence Intelligence said that, on average, some 1,000 Russian soldiers are killed or injured every day.</p><p>This astonishingly high casualty rate leaves Russia in need of a constant supply of new manpower – at a time when all signs point to the fact that the number of Russian citizens willing to enlist is plummeting.</p><p>The Kremlin is wary of calling for another mobilization after the fiasco of the September 2022 partial mobilization, which spooked hundreds of thousands of Russian men into fleeing the country. At the same time, Russia is facing massive demographic pressures – the United Nations projects that Russia’s population could drop by between 25% and 50% by 2100.</p><p>Many Russian regions, trying to reach their Kremlin-mandated recruitment targets, have dramatically increased the amount of money they pay to new military recruits. Analysts say this is an indication that “ideological” recruitment campaigns are no longer enough to motivate Russians to fight in Ukraine.</p><p>The presence of foreigners along the front lines in Ukraine is not a secret. Ukraine has been recruiting foreign volunteers since the beginning of the war, even forming specific units for them. Kyiv does not disclose information about foreigners in its ranks, but their numbers are likely running into the thousands – despite many countries, including the United Kingdom and many European countries, specifically warning their citizens against signing up.</p><p>The difference, according to the Ukrainians, in an assessment backed by human rights watchdogs, is that while those fighting for Ukraine have most likely made their decision independently and willingly, many of the foreigners in Russia’s ranks have not.</p><p>Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials told CNN that Russia’s foreign recruitment tactics boil down to three approaches: blackmail, bribery and deception.</p><p>Russian visas, residence permits and the promise of Russian citizenship – or the threat of these being stripped away – have become key tools for Russia as it tries to recruit more fighters.</p><p>According to the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials, migrants to Russia from central Asian countries, such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, are most likely to enlist for migration reasons.</p><p>From meat grinder to mopeds: How Russia rethought its war-fighting in Ukraine</p><p>The Kremlin has recently made it easier for foreigners to get visas and Russian passports in exchange for military service. Meanwhile, last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that makes it possible for naturalized Russian citizens to be stripped of their citizenship if they fail to register for military service.</p><p>According to human rights groups, including Memorial, the Russian rights watchdog which was banned in Russia in December 2021, on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, fighters from central Asian countries often say they were threatened with imprisonment and deportation unless they agreed to enlist. Ukrainian defense intelligence confirmed this.</p><p>Russia is not denying this practice. Alexander Bastrykin, the chairman of Russia’s Investigative Committee, said in May that Russian authorities had already “caught” 80,000 recently naturalized Russian citizens who were avoiding military registration, Russian media group RBC reported. He said that 20,000 of these new Russian citizens from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan were now on the front lines.</p><p>While many foreign-born men are being coerced into the military while already in Russia, many others appear to have been brought into the country in order to serve.</p><p>According to the information warfare research group OpenMinds, the number of advertisements promoting contract military service that specifically target foreigners has risen more than sevenfold since this summer.</p><p>OpenMinds’ new analysis of content on Russia’s most popular social network VKontakte showed that, by mid-2025, one in three posts advertising military contracts was aimed at foreigners, compared to just 7% of all adverts just a year ago.</p><p>The adds often include assurances that recruits will not be sent to assault units and will be assigned to specific positions with lower risk to their lives, OpenMinds said.</p><p>The data, shared exclusively with CNN, shows that about half of the adverts target Russian-speaking foreigners from post-Soviet countries, while the rest are aimed at African nations, India, Bangladesh, Iraq, Yemen and others. Only a small proportion of the adverts – about one sixth – makes no mention of a specific country.</p><p>OpenMinds said that while interest in military contracts was minimal among foreigners in the early years of the full-scale war, data from the Russian-language search engine Yandex shows that the share of searches on military contracts in post-Soviet countries increased tenfold in 2024 and continued to grow in 2025.</p><p>Russian forces are poised to finally capture Pokrovsk, a symbolically important victory with a heavy cost</p><p>The messaging varies depending on the target audience.</p><p>OpenMinds said that many of the Russian-language advertisements promise social and financial benefits as well as assistance with obtaining a Russian passport.</p><p>Social media posts circulating in China earlier this year promised good pay and promoted a certain image of masculinity, with slogans like “Be a real man!”</p><p>One Telegram channel seen by CNN targets Arabic speakers, promising would-be mercenaries fast-track Russian visas, salaries of around $2,000 to $2,500 a month, free healthcare and an all-expenses-paid lifestyle. The channels mention fighters from Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Algeria and Syria as being desirable recruits.</p><p>A Russian military contract signed by a Chinese national and seen by CNN includes some of these perks, such as a promise that the soldier will have access to free education after three years of service and that their “meals, attire and other supplies” will be paid for by Russia.</p><p>In exchange, the soldier who signed the contract agreed to “participate in combat, fulfill duties during the mobilization period, during emergencies and martial law, armed conflicts, participate in activity to keep and restore international peace and security or top international terrorist activity outside the territory of the Russian Federation.”</p><p>The Ukrainian officials who spoke with CNN about the issue said that some of the foreigners who were captured by Ukraine said they were made to sign contracts in Russian without understanding what was in them and with no translation provided.</p><p>Prisoners of war who spoke to Ukrainian investigators said their combat training lasted from one to two weeks, after which they were sent to the front lines, where they would often end up being part of the assault units forced to storm Ukrainian positions, despite the huge risks. The death toll is staggering – Usov said that of the more than 18,000 foreigners Ukraine was able to identify, at least 3,388 have been killed.</p><p>The Ukrainian government has launched a special initiative aimed at foreigners fighting for Russia and other reluctant Russian recruits, offering them a safe haven and prisoner of war status if they surrender. Pages on the program’s website can be read in English, Russian, Spanish and Arabic.</p><p>While some of the advertisements are relatively transparent about the jobs that are on offer – the ads include photographs of Russian assault units and combat soldiers – others are not.</p><p>The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials told CNN some of the prisoners of war told Ukrainian investigators that they came to Russia after being promised jobs in construction, in warehouses, as security guards or as drivers. They said this experience was most often described by prisoners from far-flung, lower-income countries like Sri Lanka, Cuba, Nepal, and some African nations.</p><p>Kenya’s foreign ministry issued a statement earlier this month, saying it had uncovered a human trafficking operation that was recruiting Kenyans to be shipped into combat under the guise of overseas jobs. It said that other Kenyan nationals who had been rescued from Russia said they were misled about the nature of the work they’d be doing and ended up in dangerous jobs, including assembling drones and handling chemicals.</p><p>Also last month, Cuba’s foreign ministry said that after finding out in 2023 that its citizens were fighting in Ukraine, it had launched a crackdown on the recruitment and human trafficking networks responsible. It said that 26 people have already been convicted, with several other trials still pending.</p><p>Last year, Sri Lanka’s government held a series of top-level meetings with Russian officials specifically to address the issue of Sri Lankan citizens being recruited to fight in the war.</p><p>Nepal has said scores of its citizens were recruited under false pretenses to join Russia’s war effort and has called on Moscow to stop the practice. Last year, Nepal went as far as banning its citizens from travelling to Russia or Ukraine for employment.</p><p>Brigadier General Dmitry Usov, who heads Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said this week that the move had worked.</p><p>“In 2023–2024, almost 1,000 citizens of Nepal signed a contract with the Russian army. In 2025, as of October 1, only one person from this country joined the Russian army,” he said.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>The Pentagon on Monday said it is reviewing \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against US Democratic Senator Mark Kelly.</p><p>Kelly, a retired US Navy captain, was one of six Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military members to refuse unlawful orders.</p><p>The announcement in a post on the Department of War X account did not detail the allegations against Kelly, but suggested the move is in response to Kelly's statements: \"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.\"</p><p>Kelly said he learned of the investigation via the Pentagon's social media post on Monday.</p><p>\"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly responded on X.</p><p>In addition to the Pentagon, US President Donald Trump posted on social media last week accusing Kelly and other Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behavior, punishable by death\".</p><p>\"I've given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.\"</p><p>Kelly was a combat pilot in the US Navy who served during the first Gulf War and later flew four space missions for Nasa from 2001 to 2011. He is married to former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who retired after being shot during a 2011 mass shooting.</p><p>Even though he retired from the military, he is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) - a federal law enacted by Congress in 1951 that subjects members of the military to a special set of rules.</p><p>It applies to all active-duty members as well as activated National Guard and Reserve members, military academy students and some civilians serving in support of the military during wartime.</p><p>It also applies to retirees and gives the military the ability to recall retirees for applicable offences, such as disobeying federal laws that \"prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces\".</p><p>The Pentagon said on Monday that further action may be taken against Kelly, including a recall to active duty for court-martial or administrative measures.</p><p>In the statement, the Pentagon said the matter would be \"handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality\", and that further official comment would be limited \"to preserve the integrity of the proceedings\".</p><p>\"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.  A servicemember's personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.\"</p><p></p><p>The video by Democrats, all of whom have served in the military or intelligence community, was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and features Kelly and US Representatives Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow. In it, they tell military members they do not need to obey illegal commands.</p><p>Kelly says in the video: \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.\"</p><p>\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" the video says.</p><p>\"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"</p><p>Trump reacted to the video in a series of irate Truth Social posts on Thursday, accusing the lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL\".</p><p>\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand,\" he wrote. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"</p><p>His remarks were met with bipartisan condemnation and the president - who is the commander-in-chief of armed forces - walked back those statements in a Fox interview on Friday, clarifying that he was \"not threatening death\" against the Democratic lawmakers.</p><p>Reposting the Pentagon statement on X on Monday, defence secretary Pete Hegseth called the Democrats' video \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" referring to the lawmakers as the \"Seditious Six\".</p><p>He said that encouraging US warriors to ignore their commanders' orders \"undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline'\".</p><p>\"Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion — which only puts our warriors in danger,\" he wrote, singling out Kelly as the only one of the six who is still subject to the UCMJ.</p><p>\"As was announced, the Department is reviewing his statements and actions, which were addressed directly to all troops while explicitly using his rank and service affiliation—lending the appearance of authority to his words,\" Hegseth wrote.</p><p>He added that Kelly's conduct \"brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately\".</p><p>Thomas King, whose works centered around indigenous stories, said he feels as though he's \"been ripped in half\" after learning he is not part Cherokee.</p><p>The trial in Dresden comes shortly after the US designated the Antifa Ost group as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>Airlines are told to resume flights to Venezuela within 48 hours or risk losing their clearance to fly there.</p><p>Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites.</p><p>The medical examiner's office says no details about the 15-year-old's death can be released or posted on its website.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

The former royal has denied those claims.</p><p></p><p>Following the Northern Irish council's vote, staff said they would begin the name-changing process for the street, which will involve a public consultation.</p><p>Councillor Anna Henry, of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party, said the motion was \"sad but necessary\".</p><p>\"Regrettably the alleged actions of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor have made it impossible for this council to continue honouring him in the manner the good people of Mid and East Antrim have done in the past.\"</p><p>The councillor who brought the motion, Lauren Gray of the Alliance Party, said it would be fitting to rename the street after the UK's late Queen Elizabeth II, but stressed that the public should have a say in the process.</p><p></p><p>Renaming Prince Andrew Way will have implications for residents, such as changing addresses for bank accounts, credit cards, driver's licences and utility bills, the council said.</p><p>The street in Carrickfergus was given that title in 1986 to mark Mountbatten-Windsor's marriage to Sarah Ferguson.</p><p>Residents in other parts of the UK have also asked their local councils to rename streets named after the former prince, according to British media reports.</p><p>In recent weeks, pressure has grown on Mountbatten-Windsor to give evidence to a US congressional committee investigating Epstein.</p><p>On Monday, the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggested that the ex-prince should testify before the House Oversight Committee.

The US and Russia are currently holding meetings in Abu Dhabi about the US peace proposal.</p><p>Ukraine has agreed to a deal to end the war with Russia with only “minor details” outstanding, a US official said, even as President Volodymyr Zelensky said more work needed to be done.</p><p>Speaking as the US army secretary was in Abu Dhabi holding meetings with Russian officials about the Trump administration’s proposal, the official said: “The Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal.  There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal.”</p><p>The US statement appeared to go further than the public position of Ukrainian officials, who also have a delegation present in Abu Dhabi and who have been in contact with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.</p><p>In a post on X, Ukraine’s national security secretary, Rustem Umerov, wrote that the delegations had “reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva.”</p><p>“We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps,” Umerov wrote. He added that Ukraine looked forward to organizing a visit of Zelensky to the US to “complete final steps and make a deal with President (Donald) Trump.”</p><p>In a post on X earlier this morning, Zelensky said: “Following the meetings in Geneva, we see many prospects that can make the path to peace real.

Jeff Tolbert, a spokesperson for Driscoll, said, meanwhile, that the talks between the US and Russian delegations in Abu Dhabi “are going well and we remain optimistic.”</p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is holding meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The original US-drafted proposal to end the war included many ideas that have previously been put forward and rejected in earlier peace negotiations.</p><p>It put pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit the size of its military and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war, all long-standing Kremlin demands as Putin presses forward with his maximalist war aims.</p><p>The US proposal called for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine that Russia has illegally annexed but not captured – a longstanding red line for Kyiv. That area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended Ukrainian towns and cities, which are seen as essential for the country’s security.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously rejected Russia’s calls for Ukraine to surrender the eastern Donbas region in exchange for some Russian-held parts of the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.</p><p>The European Union also laid out three of its red lines on Sunday.</p><p>First, Ukraine’s “borders cannot be changed by force,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement on Sunday, as top US and European officials held talks in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Second, as a sovereign nation, there cannot be limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces that would leave the country vulnerable to future attack and thereby also undermining European security,” von der Leyen added.</p><p>“Third, the centrality of the European Union in securing peace for Ukraine must be fully reflected. Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” the EU chief concluded, adding that starts with Ukraine’s reconstruction and integration into Europe’s single market and defense industrial base.</p><p>CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova, Catherine Nicholls and Kara Fox contributed to this post.</p><p>Rescue workers have recovered the body of a man from under the rubble in northeastern Kyiv, Ukraine’s emergency services said Tuesday, bringing the death toll from the Russian strike on the Ukrainian capital to seven.</p><p>At least 13 others have been injured in the attacks, including a child.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and 260 drones into Ukraine overnight, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>Let’s catch you up on the main developments we’ve been reporting today, as peace talks involving the US, Ukraine and European allies aimed at ending the war in Ukraine continue.</p><p>• US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is holding talks in Abu Dhabi about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN.</p><p>• Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he had “nothing to report” about the talks, adding, “we are monitoring media reports and analyzing them carefully.”</p><p>• Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the amended peace plan must reflect the “spirit and letter” of the talks between Putin and Trump during their August summit in Alaska.</p><p>•  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron are due to hold a call of the “Coalition of the Willing” later today, which will be an opportunity for Ukraine’s allies to discuss the amended plan and how they will proceed.</p><p>• Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine traded deadly attacks overnight, killing and wounding civilians and damaging infrastructure.</p><p>Speaking after a call today with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country sees “many prospects” for peace, following talks over the weekend with US officials in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>“Following the meetings in Geneva, we see many prospects that can make the path to peace real. There are solid results, and much work still lies ahead,” Zelensky added.</p><p></p><p>After being blindsided by the original 28-point peace plan that emerged last week, Europe on Monday put forward a counterproposal that struck out some of the provisions seen to favor Russia. This was obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources.</p><p>Starmer is due to hold a call of the “Coalition of the Willing,” later today, as Ukraine’s allies take stock of the recent diplomacy and discuss the amended peace plan.</p><p>“We have coordinated our positions and the priority issues for discussion, as well as some of our next steps and contacts,” Zelensky said of the meeting.</p><p>US President Donald Trump’s push for an end to the war in Ukraine is motivated by his desire for a win, CNN’s European Affairs Commentator Dominic Thomas says.</p><p>“We’ve seen President Trump vacillate from unambiguous support for President Zelensky to a more lukewarm approach to him,” Thomas told Elex Michaelson on CNN’s The Story Is today. “Ultimately what he’s interested in is a win, is a peace treaty that he can take responsibility for.”</p><p></p><p>But Thomas said a sustained peace would only be possible were Russian President Vladimir Putin held accountable for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“That peace treaty will not be worth the paper it’s signed on unless there is recognition that the invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory is a violation of international law,” he added.</p><p>While Thomas said Trump’s “lack of consistency” had “undermined the process,” of implementing peace, he added the president’s presence is “absolutely incontrovertible.”</p><p>Moldova said six drones had crossed into its airspace Tuesday morning, during Russia’s long-range strikes on Ukraine.</p><p>Moldova’s government said the first drone to violate its airspace was detected close to Vulcănești, near the borders with Ukraine and Romania, and that five more drones were detected across the country.</p><p>One of the drones fell on the roof of a house in northern Moldova, the government said.</p><p>In neighboring Romania, NATO also scrambled fighter jets after at least one Russian drone entered its airspace overnight into Tuesday.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that an amended peace plan for Ukraine must reflect the “spirit and letter” of the talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump during their summit in Alaska in August.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said Russia had welcomed the original version of the peace plan, which surfaced last week and was seen as heavily favoring Moscow. Following US-Ukraine talks in Switzerland, the original 28-point plan has since been pared back to a 19-point plan, which has reportedly removed some of the provisions deemed unacceptable by Kyiv.</p><p>Lavrov accused Europe and Ukraine of trying to “twist” the original plan, which had been backed by US President Donald Trump, and said Russia was waiting to receive the amended version from the US.</p><p>“If the spirit and letter of Anchorage are lost in the key understandings we have documented, then of course the situation will be fundamentally different. But so far, I repeat, no one has officially communicated anything to us,” he said.</p><p></p><p>The Kremlin said Tuesday that the initial 28-point peace plan, which emerged last week and was widely criticized as being favorable to Moscow, could be a “good basis” for talks about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The 28-point plan, first reported last week by Axios, demanded that Ukraine cede territory to Russia, limit the size of its military, and abandon its ambition to join NATO. But following talks between the US and Ukraine in Switzerland, that plan has since been pared back to a 19-point peace deal more favorable to Kyiv, and some of the most difficult issues have been stripped out, a senior Ukrainian official told the Financial Times Monday.</p><p>The Kremlin has since said it favors the initial plan, which US President Donald Trump initially gave Ukraine less than a week to accept. That deadline has since appeared to be shelved.</p><p>“Trump’s plan is currently the only substantive one, and it could serve as a good basis for negotiations,” the Kremlin said.</p><p>It claimed that the draft of this plan was “based on the understandings reached” between the US and Russia during a summit in Alaska in August.</p><p>But the origins of the 28-point peace plan have been disputed. A US Senator described the plan as a Russian “wish list,” and analysts pointed out that the text contained several potential Russianisms, raising questions about which side wrote the draft. However, the State Department has insisted that the plan was authored by the US, “with input from both the Russians and the Ukrainians.”</p><p>The Kremlin said Tuesday that there was an “information frenzy” around the peace plan, “with many contradictory data and statements.”</p><p>There is a “slim chance” that a peace deal will be achieved during this phase of negotiations, according to an executive director at a Ukrainian security think tank.</p><p>Speaking to CNN’s Rosemary Church on Newsroom Tuesday, Alexander Khara, from the Centre for Defence Strategies, cast doubt over a Russia-Ukraine truce, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambition for widespread power as an obstacle.</p><p>Khara said Putin was “not willing to compromise” because Moscow wants “not just to control Ukraine but convert their losses into some geo-political gains in Europe and elsewhere.” He added that Russia had been using diplomacy as “a tool of war.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Khara said he believes Trump was “not interested” in Ukraine or the European continent, “So that’s why the war will go on,” he added.</p><p>“There is a slim chance of any peace deal coming out of this diplomatic activity,” he said.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today that he had “nothing to report” about US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll’s talks with Russian delegates in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>“We still have nothing to report. We are monitoring media reports and analyzing them carefully,” Peskov added.</p><p>The spokesperson said Moscow understands “some adjustments are being made to the previously published text,” referring to the 28-point plan to end the war that was leaked last week and which was broadly seen as being favorable to Russia.</p><p>“We understand that the text we unofficially received earlier has now been amended. But at some point, the time will probably come when we will establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information. For now, we have no new developments in this regard,” Peskov said.</p><p></p><p>For context: Driscoll, who now appears to be playing a prominent role in the peace talks, met with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine. Those talks are continuing today, a US official has told CNN.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could visit the United States in the next few days to finalize a peace deal with US President Donald Trump, a senior Ukrainian official has just said.</p><p>“Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,” Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s national security chief, wrote on social media. “We now count on the support of our European partners in our further steps.”</p><p>“We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine’s President to the US at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President Trump,” he added.</p><p></p><p>Umerov said Ukraine appreciated the “productive and constructive” meetings with US officials in Switzerland, as well as Trump’s “steadfast efforts to end the war.”</p><p>The Trump administration’s 28-point proposal to end the war in Ukraine has been criticized as highly favorable to Russia.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European counterproposal, obtained by Reuters and confirmed to CNN to be accurate by European sources, is much more in line with Ukraine’s wishes.</p><p>Here are some key differences:</p><p>On territorial concessions: The US plan says that Luhansk, Donetsk and occupied Crimea will all be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States. It also says that Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will be frozen along the line of contact.</p><p>The European draft differs starkly, according to the version obtained by Reuters. The text reads: “Ukraine commits not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means. Negotiations on territorial swaps will start from the Line of Contact.”</p><p>On NATO expansion: The draft US plan includes a provision that NATO will not expand further, and stipulates that Ukraine will agree to not join NATO.</p><p>The European draft removes those provisions, saying that “Ukraine joining NATO depends on consensus of NATO members,” according to the Reuters version. It notes that consensus does not currently exist, but the language leaves the door open.</p><p>On Ukraine’s military: The US plan notes that Ukraine’s Armed Forces “will be limited to 600,000 personnel.”</p><p>The European plan suggests that the Ukrainian military is “capped at 800,000 in peacetime.” On both drafts, Russia’s far larger army is not asked to make cuts.</p><p>On future elections: The US draft also calls for Ukraine to hold elections within 100 days of a sealed agreement – something that analysts say would be an impractically short window to allow for campaigning.</p><p>The European draft only says that elections should be held “as soon as possible” after an agreement is signed.</p><p>For context: It’s worth noting that there are several other versions of the European text that have been reported in American and British news outlets, which differ from the copy Reuters obtained. The US 28-point plan may also have evolved since its original version following top leaders’ discussions in Geneva.</p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN</p><p>As we’ve reported, Russia and Ukraine launched deadly strikes overnight, with both reporting deaths.</p><p>Russia’s strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv and targeted “the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.</p><p>The pictures below show the aftermath of the attack on Ukraine’s capital city.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine traded deadly attacks overnight, killing and wounding civilians and damaging infrastructure.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and 260 drones into Ukraine, killing six people and wounding 13, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>The strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv and targeted “the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going,” Zelensky said.</p><p>Ukraine, meanwhile, launched a major drone attack on Russia, killing three people and wounding eight, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry.</p><p>Russian forces intercepted and destroyed 249 Ukrainian drones, including 116 that were launched over the Black Sea, the ministry said. The strikes damaged residential buildings and homes in the Russian port city Novorossiysk, according to local officials.</p><p>The commander of Ukraine’s military drone unit, Robert Brovdi, hailed Tuesday as Kyiv’s “most productive” night in November, saying the drone attack did “deep damage” to Russia.</p><p>In Romania, NATO fighter jets were scrambled to protect its airspace as Russia attacked Ukraine overnight, according to Reuters. The jets took off after at least one Russian drone breached Romanian airspace near the border with Ukraine, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing Romania’s defense ministry.</p><p>Russia launched 22 missiles and more than 460 drones into Ukraine overnight, killing six people and wounding 13, said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p>The strikes caused “extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure” in Kyiv, Zelensky said on social media on Tuesday.</p><p>“There is also destruction in the Odesa region – the ports, food supplies, and infrastructure were hit, with no military purpose whatsoever,” Zelensky said.</p><p></p><p>Russia also struck Dnipro, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Cherkasy regions, Zelensky added.</p><p>“The primary targets were the energy sector and everything that keeps normal life going.”</p><p>Zelensky thanked Ukraine’s supporters and called on the international community to put “pressure” on Russia.</p><p>“What matters most now is that all partners move toward diplomacy together,” he said.</p><p></p><p>US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held meetings with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday about a proposed plan for ending the war in Ukraine, a US official told CNN.</p><p>Driscoll will continue the meetings today, which are meant to lay the groundwork for higher-level engagements, the official said.</p><p>The meetings follow days of intense diplomacy in Switzerland, where American and Ukrainian officials negotiated over the 28-point proposal, which was authored by the US with input from Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Svitlana Vlasova, Caitlin Danaher, Lauren Kent, Anna Chernova, Gul Tuysuz, Catherine Nicholls, Charlotte Reck, Michael Williams, Eve Brennan, Billy Stockwell, Morgan Rimmer, Lex Harvey and Donald Judd contributed reporting to this post.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

Not only could our potential allies not stand him, but neither could his own colleagues,\" Tsipras wrote.</p><p>Tsipras became leader of the radical left-wing Syriza party in 2008 and oversaw its meteoric rise, culminating in his election as Greek prime minister in 2015.</p><p></p><p>Having stormed to power on an anti-austerity agenda, Tsipras — backed by Varoufakis — appeared on track to lead Greece out of the eurozone in 2015.</p><p>Despite a referendum in which Greeks resoundingly rejected the EU's proposed bailout terms, Tsipras ultimately ignored the results and accepted a new package with even harsher austerity measures. Varoufakis resigned over Tsipras' decision to reverse course.</p><p>In the memoir, Tsipras said he had harboured doubts about his finance minister from an early stage of his tenure, claiming that Varoufakis was confrontational and egotistical.</p><p>\"Varoufakis had proved himself to be unsuitable for an agreement that required complex and delicate handling,\" Tsipras wrote.</p><p>\"He was the face of negotiation, the man who attracted publicity, who graced the covers of magazines the world over … he gave the impression he was enjoying his new role.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Varoufakis told Greek state TV ERT that he has not read the book, saying that he would instead \"wait for the movie to be released\".</p><p>\"Tsipras is the creditors’ greatest achievement,\" Varoufakis said. \"He had given them everything, and they punished him. They didn’t just want him to sign a memorandum, they wanted to humiliate him.\"</p><p>Greece's former prime minister, who left office in 2019, resigned from his parliamentary seat and left Syriza in October, fuelling speculation that he will form a new party.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Former Greek PM Tsipras says no one 'could stand' Varoufakis","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/25/former-greek-pm-tsipras-says-no-one-could-stand-ex-finance-minister-varoufakis","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-25T11:36:31.000Z"}

He has only spoken to his mother three times in the 11 months since her arrest.</p><p>Two weeks ago, he told the BBC the pair had embarked on a hunger strike in a \"cry out for help\" to push for better conditions, including more phone calls and to be able to visit her husband, who is being held in a separate cell.</p><p>Both are now eating again, although Mr Bennett had been told they were looking thin. They have not yet been able to visit one another.</p><p>\"My mum and Craig are British citizens.

The President of the United States has reportedly taken the time to push for a revival of his favourite buddy cop action-comedy franchise.</p><p>According to a Semafor report, which cites “a person directly familiar with the conversations,” Trump “personally pressed” Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison - the world’s second-richest man and one of Trump’s biggest financial donors - to revive the Rush Hour series.</p><p>The president apparently wants to see more 80s-90s style, male-driven action movies being made, with plenty of explosions, car chases and outdated jokes. Rush Hour 4 ticks all the boxes.</p><p></p><p>The original trilogy (1998 – 2007) starred Chris Tucker as James Carter from the LAPD and martial arts legend Jackie Chan as Chief Inspector Lee from the Hong Kong Police Force. Both officers relunctantly teamed up for plenty of fistfights and broad humour, including problematic sexual gags and a heaping dose of racial stereotypes.</p><p>All three films were directed by Brett Ratner, who has faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct over the years – including from a former talent agency employee who accused him of rape, as well as sexual assault and harrassment accusations from performers Olivia Munn, Natasha Henstridge and Elliot Page.</p><p>Warner Bros. took these allegations seriously and cut ties with the director in 2017.</p><p>Since then, Ratner has been persona non grata in Hollywood and immigrated to Israel in 2023, as the director is reputedly friendly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>He is attempting something of a “comeback”, having directed a documentary about Melania Trump, who also serves as exec producer on the project Amazon reportedly paid $40 million for. The doc, which sounds like a soft-focus puff piece on the First Lady, airs on Amazon Prime Video in January 2026.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, is this Rush Hour 4 demand simply another petulant call from Trump or does it hide something more problematic?</p><p>Well, there’s every chance that Trump’s cinematic request could become a reality. Ellison’s son David is reportedly in control of Paramount after completing a merger between Skydance and Paramount earlier this year. Ellison is also poised to take over Warner Bros. Discovery, using his fortune to outbid the likes of Netflix and Comcast to acquire Warner’s giant movie catalogue and production.</p><p>And when you consider that White House officials have reportedly spoken with Larry Ellison about firing anchors Trump isn’t a fan of at CNN, which is part of the Warner portfolio, it seems like the empire the Ellisons are building will gladly kowtow to the cultural preferences of the cinephile in chief. Especially since they need regulatory approval for the Warner deal.</p><p></p><p>With Trump's connections enabling his troubling influence on the media landscape in mind, the question isn’t whether or not we’re getting a Trump-mandated Rush Hour 4. The question is: Will he settle for an executive producer role or worse, a Home Alone 2 shaped cameo?</p><p>One thing’s for sure: Following his glorified Melania plug, the embattled Brett Ratner may find himself busy once more, delivering the completely sought-after and not at all obsolete thrills only a fourth Rush Hour film can deliver.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Browse today's tags</p>","headline":"Donald Trump reportedly wants to revive his favourite film franchise","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/11/25/donald-trump-reportedly-pressuring-studio-to-revive-rush-hour-his-favourite-action-comedy-","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-25T13:25:23.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>UK's Indo-Pacific Minister Seema Malhotra has defended her government's immigration proposals during a visit to India, while expressing concern about a rise in foreign students seeking asylum at the end of their studies.</p><p>Under the new plans, some migrants could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently in the UK and the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years.</p><p>The proposals will apply to an estimated 2.6 million people who arrived in the country since 2021. They have drawn criticism from some quarters, including a few Labour MPs, even though the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.</p><p>The reforms are \"in line with what countries around the world do\" to stop the abuse of their immigration systems, Malhotra told the BBC in the southern Indian city of Chennai, adding that there was a \"very strong message we also send, which is that we welcome those coming legally\".</p><p>According to Malhotra some16,000 international students from across the world had applied for asylum in the UK last year after completing their courses, which she said was evidence of abuse of legal migration routes.</p><p>A further 14,800 students sought asylum this year to June 2025, latest Home Office figures show. It is unclear how many of them are Indian nationals.</p><p>\"We've seen visa abuse in the case of legal routes, where people have gone legally and then sought to overstay when their visas weren't extended,\" Malhotra said.</p><p>\"If you see that level of abuse, it undermines your immigration system. It undermines public confidence, and the fairness and control people expect.\"</p><p>India remains one of the UK's biggest sources of international students, but demand is cooling.</p><p>The number of Indian students heading to the UK has fallen 11% from last year as tougher immigration rules kick in. This has triggered concern among UK universities which rely on foreign students and are already under financial strain.</p><p>According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, India was the top country of origin for foreign students in the UK in 2023-2024, making up 25% of arrivals. China followed at 23% while Nigeria made up 8%.</p><p>Malhotra said while Britain still \"very much welcomes\" Indian students, her government was working with universities to ensure they are genuine foreign students.</p><p>She said the recently concluded free trade agreement (FTA) between the UK and India had also encouraged UK universities to open local campuses in India, with Liverpool University announcing it will open a campus in Bengaluru city in 2026 last week.</p><p>The FTA, signed in July after years of negotiations, is forecast to boost the UK's GDP by £4.8bn annually and expand bilateral trade between the two countries by £25.5bn.</p><p>As part of the education chapter in the deal, nine UK universities have been cleared to set up campuses across India.</p><p>However, these wider trade ambitions face a domestic political climate that has hardened around migration.</p><p>During a visit to India in October, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would not relax visa rules for Indian nationals despite Delhi's long-standing push for easier mobility in return for trade concessions.</p><p>Malhotra rejected the idea that Britain wants deeper trade while shutting the door to Indian professionals, citing the nearly half-a-million visas granted to Indian nationals last year across work, study and visitor categories.</p><p>The UK is moving towards a \"contribution-based\" immigration system, where settlement and long-term stay depend on a person's economic contribution rather than the length of time they have lived in the country, Malhotra said.</p><p>The government's proposal to overhaul the UK's immigration system is part of a broader attempt to show firmer control over borders, but has drawn criticism from some Labour MPs and members of the House of Lords, particularly over their potential impact on international recruitment in sectors like healthcare and social care.</p><p>While the reforms are still under consultation, Malhotra, when asked about settlement routes for migrant professionals like nurses and care workers said, \"we are expanding routes for those with skills in areas that the UK requires\".</p><p>A survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had warned that up to 50,000 nurses could leave the UK if the government went ahead with its immigration proposals.</p><p>The report notes that the UK now has more than 200,000 internationally educated nursing staff, making up around 25% of the country's total nursing workforce of 794,000.</p><p>A significant number of these nurses and care workers are from India. Several investigations, including by the BBC, have shown that many of them have fallen prey to cross-border visa scams and lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p><p>But Malhotra said the UK was ramping up efforts to protect people from such exploitation and working with law enforcement agencies of countries like India to share intelligence and crack down on such gangs.</p><p>Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>England will face tournament debutants Italy at the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup while defending champions India and Pakistan will renew their rivalry in the group stage.</p><p>The general manager of a Buddhist temple was startled to see her \"opening her eyes\" as the coffin opened, AP news agency says.</p><p>South Africa are on the brink of a first Test series win in India for 25 years after reducing the hosts to 27-2 in pursuit of 549 on day four in Guwahati.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>India’s aviation regulator has asked airline operators to “strictly avoid\" volcanic ash affected areas.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Writer Amelia Mularz was on a Chicago-to-Los Angeles redeye earlier this year when a very drunk passenger plopped into the seat next to hers.</p><p>As the plane pulled back from the gate, the man ran to the bathroom and, she says, threw up so much that a cleaning crew had to be called in from the airport. The passenger was then removed from the flight and the plane took off an hour late.</p><p>But Mularz is far from being the only passenger who has been a first-hand witness to bad plane behavior.</p><p>When University of Texas at Dallas criminology professor Lynne M. Vieraitis analyzed years’ worth of in-flight passenger incident reports, she found one common theme.</p><p>“Alcohol. Alcohol. Alcohol.”</p><p>Vieraitis and her colleague Sheryl Skaggs went through 1,600 complaints filed with the Aviation Safety Reporting System, breaking down reports about misbehaving passengers into categories such as verbal abuse, physical violence and sexual harassment.</p><p>“People getting into fights, people arguing with each other, not putting luggage away, not listening to directions — alcohol. Sexual assault and harassment — alcohol. The overwhelming thing reported in all these narratives was alcohol.”</p><p>That news may not come as a shock to anyone who has witnessed a badly behaved passenger up close. According to a report from the Institute of Alcohol Studies, 60% of adults from the UK say that they have dealt with drunk plane passengers, and 51% of those surveyed believe there is a “serious problem” with intoxicated travelers on flights.</p><p>Stories about drunk fliers abound. There was the man who tried to open the plane’s emergency door mid-flight and was duct-taped into his seat, and the off-duty pilot who caused chaos on an Alaska Airlines plane last year. And there are plenty more where those came from.</p><p>Many, many people agree that drunk plane passengers cause problems on board — from being annoying at best, to assaulting other passengers and crew members at worst. What no one can agree on, though, is whose job it is to solve it.</p><p>Europe’s biggest airline wants a 2-drink limit for passengers at airports</p><p>The incident reports that Vieraitis found on ASRS were all submitted by airline staffers — either pilots, gate agents or flight attendants. Participation in ASRS is voluntary, but it can serve as a place for employees to vent about the companies they work for.</p><p>“If you look at surveys of flight attendants, they say they can report things to their employer, but they don’t feel like anything is done, they don’t feel like the airline has their back,” she says.</p><p>And the unique challenges of being a flight attendant can exacerbate issues, since their workspace is a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air. “You can’t kick somebody out of the bar,” says Vieraitis.</p><p>While some flight attendants receive specialized training for dealing with drunk, violent or abusive passengers, it’s not always enough when they’re expected to handle a belligerent flier while also serving food and doing safety checks.</p><p>“Flight attendants are highly trained safety professionals equipped with de-escalation techniques to manage disruptive passengers and protect everyone onboard,” a spokesperson for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants union tells CNN.</p><p>“Inflight passenger disruptions have never been — and will never be — tolerated.”</p><p>There are many reasons that passengers drink. Some report that alcohol helps calm their nerves if they have a fear of flying, while others say that having a drink or two helps them sleep on the aircraft. Others admit to drinking more than they planned due to a delay, or say they didn’t realize they were intoxicated until getting on board, where dehydration and cabin pressure can intensify the effects of alcohol.</p><p>Vieraitis believes there may be a link between poor customer service and unruly passengers. The average airplane seat pitch has shrunk from 31-35 inches to 30-31, and reduced overhead bin space may mean that travelers wind up paying a fee to check their carry-on bag because there’s no place left to stow it.</p><p>Frustrated passengers plus alcohol can be a dangerous combination.</p><p>Mularz, the writer who witnessed her drunk seatmate puke up his last few meals, says crew members did a great job handling the situation on her flight.</p><p>However, she adds, there were some rumblings of internal disagreements.</p><p>“The flight attendants said they were annoyed with the gate agent for not flagging the drunk passenger to begin with,” she says. “For a second I even wondered if I was supposed to flag that he was drunk, but then I realized how bizarre that’d be to tattle on a fellow adult.”</p><p>Mularz’s story highlights how disagreements about jurisdiction can make it difficult to deal with abusive passengers. In-flight crew members might pin the blame on ground staff, as they did in her story. But airlines themselves might say that airport bars and restaurants are responsible for letting people get drunk before they fly.</p><p>Budget carrier Ryanair, which is Europe’s busiest airline, has repeatedly called for airport bars and restaurants to impose drinking curbs in the face of repeated inflight incidents involving intoxicated passengers.</p><p>“It’s completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences,” Kenny Jacobs, who was chief marketing officer of Ryanair at the time, said in a 2017 statement. “Given that all our flights are short-haul, very little alcohol is actually sold on board, so it’s incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.”</p><p>Ryanair’s message hasn’t changed. CEO Michael O’Leary said that there is a direct correlation between substance use and violent outbursts on planes.</p><p>“In the old days, people who drank too much would eventually fall over or fall asleep,” he said in an interview last year. “But now those passengers are also on tablets and powder. It’s the mix. You get much more aggressive behavior that becomes very difficult to manage.”</p><p>O’Leary has called for a two-drink maximum in airports and says that cabin crew members on Ryanair flights to “party destinations” like Ibiza have complained to management about chronic problems with intoxicated travelers.</p><p>CNN reached out to United, Delta and American Airlines, all of whom declined to comment on onboard alcohol policies or how they train their staff to deal with intoxicated passengers.</p><p>Here’s why air travel makes us so cranky — and what to do about it</p><p>For flights within the United States, the FAA has jurisdiction for handling misconduct on board.</p><p>In 2022, the FAA handed out its largest fine ever to an individual passenger: $81,950 to a woman who “spit at, headbutted, bit and tried to kick the crew and other passengers” and was restrained with flex cuffs after trying to open a plane door mid-flight.</p><p>Airlines also have the discretion to ban specific passengers, like the man who got blocked from flying Spirit Airlines ever again after he was caught vaping in the airplane bathroom.</p><p>Still, there is one major reason that the industry is so loath to restrict alcohol: money. According to travel industry analysts, alcohol is one of the biggest money-makers for airlines and airports. The higher-priced seats in first and business class often come with unlimited alcohol.</p><p>More than a dozen airports around the world, from Sydney to London Heathrow, declined to state how much money they earn from alcohol sales.</p><p>But the number of people who support bans or restrictions on airport alcohol appears to be growing. The Institute of Alcohol Studies report about bad behavior on planes showed that 67% of respondents were in favor of a drink limit at airports, and 64% said they were OK with breathalyzers being used before letting passengers board their flights.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Budget days used to be symbolised by the chancellor of the exchequer smiling and holding aloft the famous Red Box outside Number 11. Inside is a red book that contains the measures to be read out in the Budget speech.</p><p>These days, however, it's a blue book that's in the spotlight. Or more precisely, a chunky chart-filled analysis of the Budget, assessing the cost of government policies, published by a team that sits in a far corner of the Ministry of Justice building - one that few people outside this closed world know much about.</p><p>Yet it's also a department that has extraordinary influence over economic policy.</p><p>Now a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy.</p><p>And indeed whether its chairman, Richard Hughes, a Harvard-educated former Treasury mandarin, has in fact become as important as the real chancellor.</p><p>Lou Haigh, a former Labour Cabinet minister, has called the OBR an \"unelected institution dictating the limits of government ambition\". And just last week the Trades Union Congress accused the \"unaccountable OBR\" of being a \"straitjacket on growth\".</p><p>So, ahead of Wednesday's Budget, is the OBR really the tail wagging the Treasury dog - and if so, could this partly be at Labour's own hand for having changed the department's role in the first place?</p><p>Back in March, just after the Spring Statement, I asked Richard Hughes for his response to the critique that had been prevalent even then that the OBR is all-powerful.</p><p>His answer, tinged with an uncharacteristic air of exasperation, was firm.</p><p>\"The only powers we have are the ones given to us by Parliament in legislation,\" he insisted. \"And those are the powers to produce a forecast, to scrutinise the cost of government policies and to assess whether the chancellor is on the course to meet her fiscal rules.</p><p>\"The chancellor chooses the policies she wants to implement. She chooses the rules she set for herself, and if she wants to change those rules, she can change those rules. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies.\"</p><p>Officially the OBR monitors the UK government's spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending.</p><p>Yet the irony in the timing of the questions around its influence is that they follow the chancellor herself giving the forecaster even more independence and authority.</p><p>What's more, she herself appoints, with the consent of the Treasury Select Committee, the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee, who lead the OBR.</p><p>When Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets.</p><p>At the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration's ability to announce those policy changes. The new law ensures this could not happen again.</p><p>It also gives the OBR the ability to question government assumptions about spending by departments, which it did not have before, and provides direct access to Treasury data to help them do this.</p><p>Empowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves's plan.</p><p>The Chancellor believed that giving the forecaster more independence and influence would improve credibility in UK tax and spending policy; the memories of the Truss-Kwarteng mini-Budget may well have been front of mind.</p><p>And yet by September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury's own reported frustrations with the OBR were circulating.</p><p>When I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that \"promises made are constantly not kept\" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: \"The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy.\"</p><p>Yet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR's true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest.</p><p>Even before Labour's law change, the then-director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, argued that we should be \"highly cautious\" about moving towards what he described as a \"more powerful fiscal technocracy\".</p><p>\"The OBR has brought discipline and transparency to the fiscal policymaking process, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing,\" he claimed. \"Choices over how much to tax, spend and borrow are not narrow, technical questions.</p><p>\"They are inescapably political.\"</p><p>At the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. Productivity plays a key role in long-term growth prospects and therefore can influence Budget decisions.</p><p>According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves's Budget black hole.</p><p>This all has knock-on consequences for any chancellor.</p><p>For example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024.</p><p>But the bigger issue is how much credit the government should get for \"pro-growth measures\", such as planning reform or easier post-Brexit trade terms with Europe. The more this is forecast to help medium-term growth, the smaller the gap in the Budget maths.</p><p>Some on the Labour left have identified the OBR as a core structural reason why a government with a massive majority cannot act decisively on its instincts. A version of that view has spread now to some on the Labour right too.</p><p>Praful Nargund, director of the Good Growth Foundation, who unsuccessfully stood against Jeremy Corbyn in last year's general election, said last week: \"The Office for Budget Responsibility was created to enforce austerity. But in its attempt to restore credibility, it has pushed us further down the spending-cut rabbit hole without an end in sight.</p><p>\"A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn't built for the task.\"</p><p>But Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them.</p><p>In late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled \"Reconstruction\".</p><p>British building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy.</p><p>It drew little attention, yet it was from this pamphlet that the idea of the OBR was born.</p><p>The office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011.</p><p>Yet Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was going to cause the coalition government some problems.</p><p>Take the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s.</p><p>It prompted my BBC colleague Norman Smith to describe the \"road-to-Wigan-pier\" style austerity, (a reference to the George Orwell's indictment of living conditions in the industrial north of England).</p><p>Since then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a \"deep state\" played a part in bringing down her brief government - \"the economic establishment, who fundamentally don't want the status quo to change\", as she put it.</p><p>As for the OBR, she once said: \"Treasury officials go from the Treasury to the Bank of England, to the OBR to the Resolution Foundation. They go to Goldman Sachs, they… it's the same people.\"</p><p>During the Johnson-Sunak era, the OBR also published charts that the sitting government would not have welcomed, which showed the tax burden reaching post-World War Two highs.</p><p>It is the Labour government that strengthened the OBR - and the distinguished CVs of the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee ensure that it is taken seriously.</p><p>Richard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Insiders have told me there will be important changes to how the dynamic between the OBR and the Treasury will function in future.</p><p>In essence, the OBR's judgement of the amount of room for manoeuvre - the so-called \"headroom\" calculation - will now only be made once a year, from this Budget onwards. So, the tense process of the Treasury waiting on every bit of number crunching from the OBR will happen only in the run up to a full Budget.</p><p>It is a recognition that the current system has led to an ever-spinning hamster wheel of tax rise speculation.</p><p>However, defenders of the OBR say it is not the fault of the forecaster. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advises the UK that raising the headroom is the best way to stop the doom loop of tax-rise speculation harming consumer and business sentiment.</p><p>The chancellor has all but announced her strategy to increase headroom figures at the Budget. The amount will be closely watched in the markets.</p><p>Ultimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR's role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.</p><p>Plus, even if the OBR did not exist, the government's Budget decisions would still be constrained by the reaction of markets.</p><p>The UK is, after all, reliant on the \"kindness of strangers\" - foreign buyers of our debt. As the Chancellor points out now, they are increasingly likely these days to be a foreign hedge fund than a UK pension or insurance company.</p><p>So, those who now want to diminish the role of the OBR, will have to demonstrate alternative and convincing means of proving their own credibility, both on the numbers and on their political authority to drive through policies.</p><p>And yet other countries do manage without institutions such as this. So, for now, there is a serious debate emerging at this Budget, not just about the Chancellor's policies. The role, record, and future of the OBR is definitively in play.</p><p>Top picture credit: Getty Images</p><p>BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

{"details":"<p>The Vatican has issued a warning against the rise of polyamory, insisting marriage is the stable, lifelong and exclusive partnership between a man and woman.</p><p>A new document defending monogamy, signed off by Pope Leo XIV, was written as “various public forms of non-monogamous unions – sometimes called ‘polyamory’ – are growing in the West,” the text said. It also followed discussions with Roman Catholic bishops in Africa about polygamy, which has been described as a “pastoral challenge” for the church in the region and was discussed by Vatican assemblies (synods) in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>Polygamy tends to refer to one man with multiple wives, while polyamory involves people having multiple consensual romantic relationships at once.</p><p>“Polygamy, adultery, or polyamory are based on the illusion that the intensity of the relationship can be found in a succession of faces,” states the doctrinal note, titled “One Flesh – In Praise of Monogamy.” “Our age, in fact, is experiencing various drifts with regard to love: an increase in divorces, the fragility of unions, the trivialization of adultery, and the promotion of polyamory.”</p><p>The 40-page document emphasizes the importance of marriage between man and a woman, with Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, the prefect of the Vatican’s doctrine office, saying it is aimed at setting out the reasons for “the choice of a unique and exclusive union of love, a rich and total belonging to one another.”</p><p>Catholic Church must do more to help sexual abuse survivors and hold church leaders to account, hard-hitting report says</p><p>The note also says it is highlighting a development in the church’s understanding of sex within marriage: namely that is about more than having children.</p><p>In Catholic understanding, sex within marriage has two aspects: the “unitive,” which brings the couple closer together and can reflect divine love, and the “procreative,” meaning having children. Catholic teaching forbids the use of artificial contraception – a prohibition upheld by recent popes but which has been hotly debated and rejected by some in the church.</p><p>The latest doctrinal note says that “unity is the founding property” of marriage and that the “unitive purpose of sexuality… is not limited to ensuring procreation.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Two months ago Liverpool's huge summer transfer spend looked like it had made the Premier League title a formality.</p><p>Arne Slot's side were five points clear at the top of the table after only five games, having strengthened their squad with £415m worth of talent.</p><p>Florian Wirtz was signed from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial £100m, rising to a possible £116m. Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak joined on deadline day for a new record transfer fee of £125m, which could be £130m with add-ons.</p><p>Nothing could go wrong, could it?</p><p>Both signings have struggled and Liverpool's form has nosedived, leaving them 12th in the league.</p><p>Wirtz has no goals or assists in 11 Premier League outings. Isak has yet to score a goal and has one assist.</p><p>It is way too early to write off two of the most expensive Premier League signings of all time.</p><p>After all, Thierry Henry scored only two goals in his first 17 appearances for Arsenal. By the end of that season he had netted 17 times in the Premier League, 26 in all competitions and went on to be one of the league's greatest-ever players.</p><p>But curiously, when you look down the list of the Premier League's biggest incomings, there are not too many 'huge' successes.</p><p>How do you judge this? I've looked at each deal and given my verdict relative to their own achievements and that of their clubs. Fees shown are without add-ons.</p><p>Of course this is very subjective and you are free to disagree (or agree) in the comments below!</p><p>Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo won the Club World Cup with Chelsea in the summer</p><p>These two Chelsea players are grouped together because they were both signed in 2023, seven months apart, and their success is intrinsically linked.</p><p>Fernandez arrived first from Benfica in the winter window, fresh from winning the World Cup with Argentina and taking the Fifa Young Player award.</p><p>Caicedo followed in the summer from Brighton, just when it seemed the Ecuador international was bound for Liverpool.</p><p>Two years on and they have won the Conference League and the Club World Cup. However, after a sixth-placed finish in 2023-24 and coming fourth last season, could you really say Chelsea have excelled?</p><p>There is no doubting both players are real assets and they are two of the first names on the team sheet, with Caicedo playing all 38 Premier League games last season.</p><p>There is plenty of time the duo to win major honours with Chelsea (count the Club World Cup if you wish), and they are the closest challengers to Arsenal for the title this season.</p><p>Verdict: Promising. Chelsea have spent a lot of money on their squad in recent seasons but need more silverware, and a title bid, to show for it.</p><p>Jack Grealish began to fall out of favour under Pep Guardiola after only two seasons</p><p>Could you really question a player who has won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup, the Uefa Super Cup and the Club World Cup?</p><p>Grealish did start all of City's cup wins in 2023, but at no stage did he manage to reproduce the kind of consistent form he showed at Aston Villa.</p><p>In 2021-22 it was six goals and four assists in all competitions for City. In 2022-23 it was five goals and 11 assists. Compare that to his last two seasons at Villa combined, when he scored 17 goals and set up 20 more.</p><p>In the summer of 2023, City signed Jeremy Doku from Rennes in a clear signal that Pep Guardiola wasn't satisfied with Grealish.</p><p>Across the next two seasons, Grealish only made 20 Premier League appearances in each, with a total of four goals and two assists. The writing was on the wall and he was loaned out to Everton for this season.</p><p>Verdict: This is controversial, but can a player who cost £100m and was effectively discarded after two seasons be truly considered a success? It would be harsh to call Grealish a failure because he won almost all there is to win at City. But at the same time he did not kick on from his electric Villa form. Perhaps it is somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Declan Rice has scored 18 goals in 121 games since joining Arsenal</p><p>If Grealish has the medals but not the kudos, then the opposite can be said of Rice.</p><p>Rice was a very good midfielder at West Ham, but he has now proven himself to be world class and earned a reputation as a set-piece specialist too.</p><p>The 26-year-old is a certain starter for England at the World Cup next year, and Arsenal look far less effective without him.</p><p>But in terms of this discussion, the only honour Rice has picked up at Arsenal is the Community Shield in his very first appearance.</p><p>Verdict: To be determined. Arsenal have been turned into genuine title contenders by signing quality players like Rice. But until Arsenal win silverware the outlay won't be fully justified. With the Gunners six points clear at the top of the table, maybe that will change this season.</p><p>Romelu Lukaku's frustrating second spell at Chelsea lasted only one season</p><p>The first of two entries for Lukaku, and it is the move that was supposed to make him Chelsea's main striker at the second attempt (he was also on their books 2011-2014).</p><p>Chelsea signed Lukaku in 2021 from Inter Milan, where he had scored 64 goals in 95 games in all competitions, won the Scudetto and was the Serie A Footballer of the Year.</p><p>Surely Lukaku would be a success? He did score four goals in his first four games, but his impact very quickly waned and after the turn of the year he netted only three Premier League goals from a total of 15 goals in 44 matches across all competitions.</p><p>After one season, he was gone again.</p><p>Verdict: Failure. Lukaku won the Club World Cup in February 2022 but that's scant return for such a huge outlay. He returned to Inter on loan after just one season and eventually left Chelsea permanently in 2024, joining Napoli for just £30m where he would again win the Italian title.</p><p>Paul Pogba twice left Manchester United for Juventus on a free transfer</p><p>All told, this is considered one of the worst pieces of transfer business.</p><p>Pogba had left Manchester United for Juventus as a free agent in 2012, and four years later they spent £89m to bring him back to Old Trafford.</p><p>Pogba did stay at United for six years in his second spell, but he was supposed to rejuvenate the team and there was little evidence of this.</p><p>A return of 39 goals in 226 games isn't terrible, but only in the 2018-19 season -where he scored 13 in the Premier League and was named in the PFA Team of the Year - did he ever live up to his price tag.</p><p>Verdict: Failure. United only won the Europa League and the EFL Cup during his second spell, with brief glimpses of his quality. At the end of his contract in 2022 he went back to Juve on a free.</p><p>Antony has won 16 senior caps for Brazil, but has not been called up since 2023</p><p>Signed by Erik ten Hag from Ajax in 2022 as part of his rebuild of the squad, Antony was supposed to bring pace and creativity to the attack.</p><p>The Brazilian had scored 24 goals and provided 22 assists in two seasons for the Dutch club. But at Old Trafford he looked a completely different player, devoid of confidence.</p><p>Antony scored only five Premier League goals and provided three assists in two and a half seasons before he was loaned to Real Betis, a move which then became permanent.</p><p>That he has excelled at Betis, with 15 goals and seven assists in 38 games across all competitions, makes his form at Old Trafford all the more mystifying.</p><p>Verdict: Failure. Antony did win the FA Cup (although he was an unused substitute in the final victory over Manchester City) and EFL Cup, but his performances did not come close to the huge price tag.</p><p>Harry Maguire is not a first-choice selection for Manchester United despite his huge transfer fee</p><p>Maguire became, and still is, the most expensive defender in the world when he moved from Leicester City in 2019.</p><p>But his name is synonymous with a continued period of decline at Old Trafford and he only has one EFL Cup medal (he missed the FA Cup final win through injury) to show for it.</p><p>Under Ten Hag he was stripped of the captaincy and came close to a cut-price move to West Ham in 2023. And since the 2021-22 season, he has not started more than half the club's Premier League games in any campaign.</p><p>Verdict: Failure. For the world's most expensive defender to win so little, never make the PFA Team of the Year and play relatively few games in his six seasons means the deal does not come close to a success.</p><p>Josko Gvardiol has only been at Manchester City for two years so still has the time to live up to his price tag</p><p>Signed in 2023 from RB Leipzig, Gvardiol became the second-most expensive defender of all time behind Maguire.</p><p>The Croatia international won the Uefa Super Cup, the Club World Cup and the Premier League in his first season at Manchester City.</p><p>Despite City suffering a poor season in 2024-25, Gvardiol was named the club's Player of the Season.</p><p>Verdict: The jury's out. Gvardiol had a good start at the Etihad, and he is only 23 so has the best years of his career ahead of him. His versatility and composure are an asset, but at the moment the transfer fee looks excessive.</p><p>Romelu Lukaku had a good first season at Manchester United but it was diminishing returns for his Old Trafford career</p><p>Manchester United thought they were solving their goalscoring problems in 2017 when they signed Lukaku from Everton, where he had netted 87 goals in 166 games.</p><p>But like every United player on this list, it was a case of overpaying to little tangible return.</p><p>Lukaku's numbers are not actually terrible. He scored 16 Premier League goals in his first season, and 27 goals in all competitions - one of only 11 players to break the 25-goal barrier since 1992-93.</p><p>What started promisingly soon drifted off, with 26% of his goals - or 11 out of 42 - being scored in the first two months of his Old Trafford career. The club's tactical approach did not help, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer  at times playing him out on the wing.</p><p>Verdict: Failure, though with a caveat as United did recoup £68.1m when he left for Inter Milan in 2019. Despite the initial goals, Manchester United won nothing in his two years.</p><p>Virgil van Dijk has won the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at Liverpool</p><p>We have had to to get to the bottom of the list to find the only player who can be considered to have truly lived up to his price tag.</p><p>Signed from Southampton in 2018, Van Dijk has earned a reputation as one of the world's very best defenders - with the trophies to boot - over an extended period.</p><p>The central defender has made 336 appearances for Liverpool, scoring 30 goals, and has been named in the PFA Team of the Year five times. He was also PFA Player of the Season in his first year at Anfield.</p><p>With one Champions League, two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two EFL Cups, the Uefa Super Cup and the Club World Cup to his name, he's won the level of silverware you'd expect for a player in this price range.</p><p>Verdict: Total success.</p><p></p><p>Follow your club with BBC Sport</p><p>Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast</p><p>Get football news sent straight to your phone</p><p>Have Premier League's most expensive signings been successful?</p><p>What next for friendly foes who see each other 'more than family'?</p><p>Captivating but confusing - what state is international rugby in?</p><p>Jimmy Cliff spoke about the film that brought reggae to the world</p><p>Historian Rutger Bregman examines today's un-serious elites</p><p>Chris explores the future of tech and what it holds for him</p><p>How do high-profile athletes manage their OCD?</p><p>Have Premier League's most expensive signings been successful?</p><p>What next for friendly foes who see each other 'more than family'?</p><p>Hampton voted BBC Women's Footballer of the Year</p><p>In Pictures: Sporting photos of the week</p><p>Ten-man Everton stun Man Utd after Gueye sees red.

{"details":"<p>Live Updates</p><p>• Key monthly metrics from the US government continue to be released on a lag after the shutdown delayed data gathering by federal statistics agencies.</p><p>• September data for the Producer Price Index showed that prices rose by 0.3%. The annual wholesale inflation level remained at 2.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>• A separate report, from the Commerce Department, showed that retail sales rose 0.2% in September. Economists were expecting sales rose 0.3% from the previous month. Retail sales are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.</p><p>Tuesday’s PPI data indicated that some firms are shielding their customers from the brunt of the steep and blunt tariffs on imported goods, wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p><p>He noted the trade services category, which tends to be quite volatile, measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. So, economists have been watching that category closely as a potential indication for how much businesses might be absorbing some of the tariff costs versus passing them along to consumers.</p><p>Trade services in September dipped 0.2%, following a 1.7% drop in August, PPI data showed.</p><p>“But the picture differs markedly by sector, with auto retailers accepting substantially lower margins, while most other retailers are passing on all the rise in acquisition prices to consumers,” Tombs wrote.</p><p>For consumers, September PPI could mean better news if they’re in the market for sneakers or sports equipment, less so if they’re wanting to buy a new computer or TV.</p><p>In addition to auto dealers, the industries showing some of the biggest hits to their margins (and potentially lower cost increases for the end consumer) included retailers of sporting goods, clothing, shoes and jewelry as well as wholesalers of machinery, paper and plastics, PPI data shows.</p><p>Industries with the largest increases in margins (indicating higher costs are potentially being passed on to consumers) were retailers of TVs, video equipment, computers, furniture and flooring – categories where the US is heavily reliant on imports.</p><p>US home sales based on contract signings rose in October to the highest level in nearly a year, in a sign that lower mortgage rates are spurring home-buying activity.</p><p>Pending home sales rose 1.9% in October from the prior month, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, bringing the index to its highest level since November 2024. Sales were up across the country except in the West, with the Midwest seeing a robust 5.3% monthly increase.</p><p>“The Midwest shined above other regions due to better affordability, while contract signings retreated in the more expensive West region,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a release. “Days on the market typically lengthen from November through February, providing better negotiating power to buyers during the holiday season.”</p><p>It typically takes about 30 to 60 days for a home sale to close after an offer was accepted. Mortgage rates have been steadily declining since May, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching this year’s lowest point in late October. Mortgage rates have increased since.</p><p>US home prices increased in September at the weakest pace since mid-2023 as affordability challenges in major markets across the country kept buyers on the sidelines.</p><p>The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index rose 1.3% in September, S&P Global said Tuesday, slightly down from August’s 1.4% gain.</p><p>The index has been steadily weakening since 2022, when the Federal Reserve began to hike interest rates to tamp down inflation. The central bank is now lowering borrowing costs, with its benchmark lending rate at its lowest point in three years.</p><p>“National home prices continued trailing inflation, with September’s (Consumer Price Index) running 1.7 percentage points ahead of housing appreciation,” Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables & commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a release. “This marks the widest gap between inflation and home-price growth since the two measures diverged in June, with the spread continuing to widen each month.”</p><p>Chicago, New York and Boston saw the strongest price gains in September, while home prices in Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas and Miami declined that month.</p><p>“Markets that were pandemic darlings — particularly in Florida, Arizona, and Texas — are now experiencing outright price declines,” Godec said. “Meanwhile, traditionally stable metros in the Northeast and Midwest continue to post solid gains, suggesting a reversion to pre-pandemic patterns where job markets and urban fundamentals drive appreciation rather than migration trends and remote-work dynamics.”</p><p>Wall Street started the day on a fairly quiet note as investors digested a batch of long-delayed economic data.</p><p>Within minutes of the opening bell the Dow was already up by close to 270 points, or 0.5%. The broader S&P 500 hovered in and out of the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%.</p><p>Stocks are coming off two days of strong gains as hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted markets. However, the S&P 500 and Dow are still on track for their first losing month since April. The Nasdaq is set for its first losing month since March.</p><p>Investors were keen to see how aspects of the economy – like retail sales – fared in recent months. Investors have embraced hopes for Fed rate cuts after recent comments from central bank officials suggested a cut could be on the table.</p><p>Treasury yields ticker lower Tuesday morning as investors leaned in to bets that the Fed will cut rates in December.</p><p>Gold futures rose 1.3%. Gold prices can rise when the Fed is expected to lower rates.</p><p>Wholesale goods prices leapt 0.9% in September – the sharpest monthly increase for the category in more than 18 months – and were the driver behind the overall September gain in the Producer Price Index, the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Tuesday.</p><p>Wholesale services prices were flat for the month.</p><p>Energy prices, particularly sharp-rising gas prices, accounted for about two-thirds of that goods index monthly increase. Within goods, categories such as meats, residential electric power and motor vehicles also moved higher.</p><p>When taking energy out of the equation, as well as food, the underlying goods inflation trend perhaps shows a silver lining:</p><p>“Core goods price gains slowed to 0.2% after a couple of larger pops, suggesting tariff pressure might be ebbing,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, wrote Tuesday in a note to investors.</p><p>The delayed data for September’s Producer Price Index showed that core inflation is “moving away from the Fed’s 2% target rate,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, in a note Tuesday.</p><p>“There is not no inflation and it is higher than the 2.1% year-on-year rate for core factory goods when the president took office in January,” he wrote.</p><p>Headline inflation mostly remained close to expectations.</p><p>The federal government on Tuesday released key economic reports on inflation and spending, but the numbers likely did little to sway the heated debate among Federal Reserve policymakers.</p><p>Central bankers are split on whether they should lower interest rates again at their upcoming meeting in December. They’ve lowered rates twice this year, in September and October, each time by a quarter point, bringing their key interest rate to its lowest level in three years.</p><p>One side — mostly members of the Fed’s Board of Governors — argues that the Fed should continue lowering rates to preserve the labor market’s health, while the other camp believes that officials should hold rates steady and get the job done on inflation, considering that it has remained above their 2% target for more than four years.</p><p>The latest data didn’t offer any clear indication that the economy urgently needs any relief from the Fed — nor that price pressures are getting out of control. The numbers, delayed by the government shutdown, are also dated.</p><p>Retail spending in September was on the weaker side, but it remained in positive territory. And inflation at the wholesale level that month came in mostly as economists had expected.</p><p>When economists and policymakers analyze inflation data, they often look to “core” indexes that strip out the categories of food and energy, which tend to be more volatile.</p><p>In the September Producer Price Index, that underlying trend looked fairly tame: Core PPI rose just 0.1% for the month, which brought the annual rate to 2.6%, the lowest since July 2025. This is better than the 0.3% monthly gain and 2.7% annual rate economists were expecting for core, according to FactSet consensus estimates.</p><p>PPI doesn’t translate directly to the inflation consumers see; however, sharp-rising goods prices – specifically in the areas of gasoline, food and electricity – could be foretelling that those key household purchases could get even pricier than they already are.</p><p>Sales at US retailers increased in September for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by low unemployment and a buoyant stock market.</p><p>Retail sales, which account for about a third of overall spending, rose 0.2% in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was a much slower pace than August’s 0.6% gain.</p><p>But after factoring in the 0.3% increase in prices that month, according to the Consumer Price Index for September, retail spending edged down 0.1%.</p><p>Spending was up across half of categories in September, increasing the most at so-called miscellaneous retailers by a solid 2.9%. Sales also increased at restaurants and bars, rising 0.7%. Meanwhile, sales were down at car dealerships, clothing stores, electronics retailers, department stores and online.</p><p>The report was originally due on October 16, but it was delayed because of the government shutdown.</p><p>The figures show that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, was somewhat weak heading into the current quarter, which stretches from October through December. In September, employers added jobs at a robust pace and unemployment ticked up but remained low.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a biting rebuke of the Federal Reserve, said members of the central bank should quit commenting publicly about the potential direction of rate-setting policy and focus instead on listening to Americans who are struggling with high borrowing rates.</p><p>“It’s time for the Fed to move back into the background like it used to, calm things down, work for the American people, [and] set monetary policy on a good course,” Bessent said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday morning. “This isn’t sport; it’s people’s lives. We just need to calm down all these speeches by these bank presidents that are redundant.”</p><p>Markets have moved – sometimes dramatically – in recent days after Fed governors and regional bank presidents commented on potential monetary policy decisions.</p><p>But Bessent said he believes the Fed should lower rates in December, arguing that the government shutdown hurt the economy.</p><p>“We know the economy hasn’t gotten better,” he said. “I’m not even sure what the discussion is here.”</p><p>US wholesale inflation picked up speed in September, an indication that prices could soon heat up even more for consumers.</p><p>The shutdown-delayed Producer Price Index for September showed that prices increased 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the annual inflation rate at 2.7%. In August, wholesale prices fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, largely because of compressed profit margins.</p><p>August’s annual increase, which was initially estimated at 2.6%, was upwardly revised to 2.7%.</p><p>Economists were expecting that producer prices rose 0.3% from August and was 2.6% for the 12 months ended in September.</p><p>Black Friday through Christmas will test America’s economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America.</p><p>High-income consumers keep spending like they’ve never heard of this affordability crisis people keep talking about.</p><p>Middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they’re fed up with their financial situations, are also still spending, in aggregate.</p><p>But Americans are all spending more in part because prices are higher. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up.</p><p>It’s one reason a poll published by Fox News this week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July.</p><p>Read more here.</p><p>Something in the US economy isn’t adding up, and it’s rattling the people charged with wrangling inflation and keeping the labor market intact.</p><p>US companies have sharply slowed their hiring this year, hesitant to invest without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump’s sweeping economic policies. The economy lost jobs in June and August, and the average pace of job gains for the three months ending in September was only around 62,000, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>Yet workers’ productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. And gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, has stayed robust.</p><p>That dichotomy of an expanding economy and a softening labor market presents a conundrum for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, complicating their efforts to determine whether the economy needs cooling or boosting.</p><p>A growing economy, boosted by resilient consumers and massive investments in AI, should be spurring hiring, especially now that the Fed has started lowering borrowing costs.</p><p>But that hasn’t happened — and there are fears it won’t.</p><p>Read more here.</p><p>President Donald Trump and his economic team often respond to concerns about the affordability crisis by touting how much cheaper gasoline is than under his predecessor.</p><p>For the vast majority of 2025, this was a legitimate bragging point for the White House.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>For the first time since the start of Trump’s second term, the discount between this year’s prices and last year’s has effectively disappeared.</p><p>The national average for regular gas stood at $3.055 on Tuesday, almost exactly the same as $3.056 a year ago under former President Joe Biden, according to AAA.</p><p>In fact, Tuesday breaks an eight-day streak where the national average was up on a year-over-year basis, according to AAA data shared with CNN.</p><p>It’s a big shift from earlier this year, when gas was 30, 40 and even 50 cents cheaper than the same point in 2024.</p><p>Read more here.</p><p>US stock futures were lower Tuesday morning as investors awaited a slew of economic data.</p><p>Dow futures fell 34 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.11%.</p><p>Stocks are coming off two days in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 2.69% on Monday, posting its best day since May.</p><p>Wall Street is trying to discern whether the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark interest rate at its policy meeting in December.  Traders on Tuesday morning were pricing in an 81% chance that the Fed cuts rates, according to CME FedWatch.</p><p>New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly in recent days have suggested they could support a rate cut in December, which helped send stocks higher on Friday and Monday.</p><p>Stock investors like lower interest rates because it encourages spending and business activity, boosting corporate profits, while lowering bond yields, making stocks relatively more appealing.</p><p>“During this holiday-shortened week, investors will receive a cornucopia of data now that the government is open again,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note. “Some of the data will be a bit stale. But they should indicate how [the third quarter] ended for the economy.”</p><p>CNN’s Fear and Greed Index hovered in “extreme fear.”</p><p>Next up in the pipeline of shutdown-delayed economic reports is the September iteration of the Producer Price Index.</p><p>This closely watched report provides a gauge on inflation at the wholesale level: It lays out the average change in the selling prices that producers receive for their goods and services. While PPI doesn’t directly translate to the Consumer Price Index, it’s viewed as a potential bellwether for the prices consumers may see in the months ahead.</p><p>That’s where things get interesting with this seemingly old-news report: The trajectory of the pricing trends in Tuesday’s report could provide a window into the price increases consumers are seeing currently and into the near future.</p><p>That could be especially salient considering the October CPI has been drastically marred as the shutdown hampered data-collection efforts.</p><p>Economists expect that producer prices likely rose 0.3% in September, which would be an acceleration from the preliminary 0.1% drop reported for August, a decline that was driven by compressed profit margins. The annual rate is expected to hold at 2.6%.</p><p>While the federal government is starting to release delayed economic data following the record-breaking shutdown, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that a lot of the data covering last month won’t be published in its usual form.</p><p>That’s because the shutdown prevented government statistical agencies from collecting all the necessary information to produce various reports.</p><p>As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced last week it will only be publishing limited October price data as opposed to the complete data included in monthly Consumer Price Index reports.</p><p>The agency also said it won’t be publishing an October jobs report. Rather, some of the data that would otherwise make it into that report will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.</p><p>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

{"details":"<p></p><p></p><p>Carlos Alcaraz</p><p>It is a rivalry that has swiftly come to be defined by its breathtaking quality on the court and, away from it, a close friendship founded on mutual admiration.</p><p>At the conclusion of the 2025 season, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner stand clear from the rest at the top of men's tennis.</p><p>As they continue to inspire each other to greater heights, there is no suggestion that the new duopoly in men's tennis will be broken up any time soon.</p><p>For a second successive year, Spaniard Alcaraz and Italy's Sinner split all four Grand Slam titles between them, taking their total major wins to six and four respectively.</p><p>Remarkably, in 2025 there was not a single tournament in which both Alcaraz, 22, and Sinner, 24, played that was not eventually won by one of them.</p><p>The generational talents have met in the past three major finals, having contested an unforgettable first at the French Open in May.</p><p>Their ever-tightening grip on the men's tour was further emphasised when they met in a final for the sixth time this year to decide the season-ending ATP Finals.</p><p>Yet, despite all that was at stake - the trophy, the world number one ranking, and a $5m jackpot - the pre-tournament favourites practised together before beginning their title bids in Turin, and later shared a selfie which has received more than half a million likes on Instagram.</p><p>Beyond the silverware and prize money, both are fully aware of the importance of the other in unlocking their full potential, with the story of their respective careers now inevitably intertwined.</p><p></p><p></p><p>24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic</p><p>A dizzying five-and-a-half hours of extraordinary drama answered, unequivocally, the question that lingered over men's tennis.</p><p>During the 'Big Three' era of men's tennis, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer captured 66 of a possible 81 Grand Slam titles over two decades of dominance.</p><p>The Roland Garros final heralded the undisputed succession of that rivalry as the much-hyped first showdown between Sinner and Alcaraz for a major title exceeded all expectations. It was a match that truly transcended the sport.</p><p>In truth, Alcaraz and Sinner had already long begun writing their own chapter.</p><p>They hinted at the epics to follow with a five-hour, five-set thriller in their US Open quarter-final in 2022 which ended at a record late finishing time of 2.50am in New York.</p><p>Another five-setter, extending beyond four hours, at Roland Garros in 2024 had further built anticipation of what might lie ahead.</p><p>Alcaraz had triumphed in the previous four meetings before his first Grand Slam final showdown with Sinner in Paris. He will begin the next encounter having won seven of the past nine.</p><p>It is a surprising imbalance between the game's heavyweights, and the statistics indicate Sinner's underperformance in their meetings has been the defining reason.</p><p>Sinner leads the ATP Tour for 'conversion score' - put simply, he is the most clinical finisher when presented with the opportunity to end a point.</p><p>When Sinner meets Alcaraz, he tends to waste chances he would normally seize - his conversion score plummets by 13% - while his serve quality also drops.</p><p>Conversely, Alcaraz leads the tour for 'steal score' - a measure demonstrating his unparalleled ability to absorb pressure and turn defence into attack.</p><p>Alcaraz thrives in their showdowns and raises the quality of his returns, forehands and backhands against Sinner.</p><p>Reassuringly for Sinner, in meetings in which he is able to be as clinical as against the rest of the tour, he can expect to edge their duels.</p><p>Nadal and Federer had Wimbledon 2008</p><p>Djokovic and Nadal had the 2012 Australian Open</p><p>Djokovic and Federer had Wimbledon 2019</p><p>This was the first battle between Alcaraz and Sinner for one of the sport's major titles.</p><p>But something exceptional will be required to replace the 2025 French Open as the enduring zenith of their rivalry.</p><p>The significance of the events in Paris was evident in the frenzied grandstands of Court Philippe Chatrier, the outpouring of praise from players, legends and fans on television and social media, the sight of Spain's footballers gathered on the pitch around a phone to follow their compatriots' fightback before their Nations League final.</p><p>Its status as an all-time classic could not have been foreseen as Sinner set up three championship points on Alcaraz's serve.</p><p>But that label was undeniable when the longest ever French Open final concluded, the crowd rising to their feet as an exhausted Alcaraz dropped to the clay after completing an astonishing comeback.</p><p>Alcaraz's eventual triumph, clinched with a stunning on-the-run forehand down the line to conclude the match tie-break required to separate them, was ultimately made possible by his bravery on the big points and his willingness to play aggressively in the key moments.</p><p>He is celebrated as a showman, competing with child-like joy and freedom. His propensity to favour the spectacular rather than safe option may have frustrated his team and supporters at times during his development - and he remains much more prone to in-game momentum swings than Sinner.</p><p>However, here it delivered a stunning climax.</p><p>He hit 17 more winners than Sinner in the French Open final. But, crucially, he produced 12 more than his opponent in the decisive games at the end of sets - and specifically those later in the match - to pull off a miracle.</p><p>Sinner had won 193 points to Alcaraz's 192.</p><p>Winners in last four games of a set</p><p>Set</p><p>Alcaraz</p><p>Sinner</p><p>Difference</p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>0</p><p>2</p><p>2</p><p>4</p><p>-2</p><p>3</p><p>6</p><p>1</p><p>+5</p><p>4</p><p>4</p><p>1</p><p>+3</p><p>5</p><p>9</p><p>3</p><p>+6</p><p>Last four game total</p><p>23</p><p>11</p><p>+12</p><p>Match total</p><p>70</p><p>53</p><p>+17</p><p>Alcaraz became only the third player in the Open era to win a men's singles Grand Slam final after saving match points, following Djokovic (Wimbledon 2019) and Gaston Gaudio (Roland Garros 2004).</p><p>But neither player, in their contrasting emotional states, was left in any doubt that they had been part of something greater.</p><p>Their admiration and respect for one another was clear - and both knew they would need to return with new tricks for their future battles.</p><p>Alcaraz to a devastated Sinner</p><p></p><p></p><p>BBC pundit Todd Woodbridge</p><p>For the first time since 2002 - when Sinner was less than a year old and Alcaraz not yet born - the Wimbledon men's singles final did not feature one of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic or Andy Murray.</p><p>For Sinner, the rematch on the grass of Centre Court was as much a test of his mental resolve as anything else - not least when he fell a set behind.</p><p>Sinner served a three-month doping suspension after retaining his Australian Open title in January as part of a challenging start to the year for the Italian.</p><p>Then came the devastation of Paris. But, just 35 days later, Sinner was able to exact revenge on Alcaraz in a ruthless display.</p><p>Having taken time to be at home with family before embracing an intense period of training, Sinner delivered a serving masterclass while dominating from the baseline.</p><p>Your browser does not support this video</p><p>To set up set point</p><p>So much so that it even caused Alcaraz to make an uncharacteristic show of frustration.</p><p>Your browser does not support this video</p><p>To set up break point</p><p>Alcaraz to his team during the Wimbledon final</p><p>Sinner had, at last, been able to unleash the devastating combination of power and precision by which he dominates all others.</p><p>Your browser does not support this video</p><p>To set up match point</p><p>Dictating with brutal, flat ball-striking against the tour's escape artist, Sinner once again earned three championship points. This time, he would not be denied.</p><p>He crouched to the ground and took a moment for himself, having rebounded from heartbreak to secure his first Wimbledon title.</p><p>The significance of the victory, beyond the tangible, was not lost on his team.</p><p>Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill</p><p>In south-west London, Sinner, so often stifled by Alcaraz, asserted his game and performed at a level more comparable to his tour average.</p><p>Not only did improved serving in the Wimbledon final allow Sinner to play more shots in attack - meaning those points where he received a low-quality shot, was positioned up the court, or was able to hit from a comfortable contact point - but he was able to capitalise on the opportunities that provided.</p><p>As he sought to close out victory, Sinner won 92% of points when positioned in attack as he comprehensively lay his demons to rest.</p><p>The fourth Grand Slam title of Sinner's career was, significantly, his first major title not on a hard court. It also ended a run of five consecutive losses to his main rival.</p><p>Sinner at Wimbledon</p><p></p><p></p><p>Alcaraz to Sinner in New York</p><p>Two months later, Alcaraz and Sinner became the first players in the Open era to meet in three consecutive major finals in the same season.</p><p>This time, it was Alcaraz who powered to a four-set win to edge their blockbuster trilogy in New York - and dethrone Sinner as world number one for the first time in 65 weeks.</p><p>Alcaraz and coach Juan Carlos Ferrero claimed to have quickly identified what they needed to correct after the loss to Sinner at Wimbledon.</p><p>While they chose to keep the details to themselves, a subtle change in the Spaniard's serve appeared to provide the foundation for success.</p><p>Former British player Tim Henman</p><p>Having highlighted the importance of improving his serve at the start of the year, Alcaraz ended the US Open having won a remarkable 97% of his service games.</p><p>In the final, the Spaniard increased the use of wide serves, to both sides, and added pace, in a bid to manoeuvre Sinner - and did so while maintaining a high first and second-serve win percentage.</p><p>That tweak created the attacking opportunities he needed to dominate, and which he had been starved of at Wimbledon.</p><p>In a near-faultless display, Alcaraz hit 10 aces - including one to clinch his third championship point - won 83% (45/54) of his first-serve points and fired in 41 winners.</p><p>Former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli</p><p>Having been comprehensively beaten, Sinner reflected on the challenge posed by being confronted by Alcaraz's variety in finals once he has blasted his way through the rest of the draw.</p><p>It was once again the Italian's turn to problem solve.</p><p>Sinner after losing the US Open final</p><p></p><p></p><p>Alcaraz to Sinner after the ATP Finals</p><p>The big question, at the end of a season in which their rivalry entered the stratosphere, is where it might go from here.</p><p>The answer is likely to lie in Sinner's admission that he needs to adapt. Specifically, to be less one-dimensional - and more like Alcaraz.</p><p>Alcaraz is, at present, the only player with the weaponry and unpredictability to truly unsettle Sinner, armed with his mastery of drop shots and slices, and willingness to come to the net.</p><p>By contrast, Sinner leads the ATP Tour in the use of core shots (88%) - those which travel through the opponent's baseline - meaning he plays with the least amount of variation of any player.</p><p>Quite often, he does not need to. Until he meets Alcaraz.</p><p>There have already been signs of a shift in Sinner's approach since the US Open.</p><p>While only a snapshot, Sinner's use of variation shots was an Alcaraz-like 25.9% in his opening match at the Vienna Open in October.</p><p>Their dominance does not look set to end any time soon.</p><p>Beyond their stranglehold on the majors, Djokovic is the only player other than Alcaraz and Sinner to claim more than 20 ATP Tour-level titles since the start of 2020. All three have won 24.</p><p>But at 38 years old, Djokovic remains without the outright record 25th major singles title he has been chasing since he equalled Margaret Court's all-time total at the 2023 US Open.</p><p>Few would bet against anyone denying Alcaraz and Sinner another sweep of major final showdowns next year, but fans will be keen to watch for signs that point to a third challenger in the new season.</p><p>After losing to 19-year-old Joao Fonseca in the final of the Swiss Indoors last month, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina identified the Brazilian as the only player who can rival Alcaraz and Sinner.</p><p>Fellow top-20 players Ben Shelton, Jack Draper, Casper Ruud and Jakub Mensik will each hope to kick on after winning ATP Masters 1000 titles this year.</p><p>But for now, Alcaraz and Sinner continue only to measure themselves against the other.</p><p>Alcaraz</p><p>Should their dominance continue in 2026, both players could complete the career Grand Slam by June.</p><p>For that to happen, Alcaraz would need to win his first Australian Open, before Sinner triumphs at the French Open.</p><p>It is a feat achieved by only eight men in history.</p><p>Alcaraz will begin the year as world number one, having regained the title at the ATP Finals - although Sinner went on to lift the trophy in Turin.</p><p>He leads by just 550 points - less than the 700-point gap between a Grand Slam winner and a runner-up.</p><p>And, wherever their rivalry resumes, it will do so with both players having won exactly 1,651 points of the 3,302 points they have contested across their 16 official matches to date.</p><p>Despite all they have already achieved, there remains the sense that they are only getting started.</p><p></p><p>Credits</p><p>Written by Harry PooleEdited by Amy LofthouseSub-edited by Sonia OxleyDesign by Scott McCallImages by Getty ImagesData provided by TennisViz</p>","headline":"What next for friendly foes who see each other 'more than family'?","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/extra/fqr8fcasop/alcaraz-v-sinner-the-evolution-of-a-new-duopoly","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-22T18:30:00.000Z"}

{"details":"<p>Ireland's Tadhg Beirne received a 20-minute red card against the All Blacks, which was later rescinded</p><p>The Autumn Nations Series has thrown up some superb rugby; from New Zealand's final-quarter blitz of Ireland in Chicago to the dramatic finish between Wales and Japan in Cardiff.</p><p>There's been Louis Bielle-Biarrey's brilliance for France, Argentina's amazing comeback against Scotland, England's emergence as a global force, and South Africa cementing their greatness with formidable victories in Paris and Dublin.</p><p>But while there is much to celebrate, there have been frustrations too, particularly over the officiating of foul play and the use of the television match official [TMO].</p><p>\"Bloody absurd\" is how Japan boss Eddie Jones has described, external the amount of time lost in the game to stoppages, while according to former England wing Chris Ashton, the officiating at times across the month has been \"bang average\".</p><p>After Ireland's defeat by South Africa lasted well in excess of two hours, with five yellow cards and the hosts at one point down to 12 men, former Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris said the game felt \"broken\".</p><p>So why is the sport in this predicament, and what can it do to improve?</p><p>There is a paradox at the heart of rugby union. An inherently physical - and, to some extent, dangerous sport - has faced an existential crisis over safety, with numerous ex-players embroiled in legal action against the game's authorities.</p><p>As a result, the law-makers have spent years trying to crack down on dangerous play by empowering referees to sanction illegal tackles with red and yellow cards.</p><p>But while there is an ambition to recalibrate the sport from a collision game back towards more of an evasion one, rugby union at the highest level has never been more brutal, as the Springboks showed in their dismantling of Ireland at the Aviva.</p><p>Understandably therefore, the officials are on red alert, desperate to ensure any dangerous tackles or collisions don't slip through the net. What does this lead to? TMO referrals. Stoppages. Time taken out of the game. A sport that is already complex and hard to referee, becoming even more so.</p><p>\"Name a sport where the officials are more visible than rugby?\" asks World Cup winner Paul Grayson.</p><p>\"It is a very difficult game to officiate anyway, without all the extra goings-on.\"</p><p>\"The only other game I can think of where there are that many contacts and situations is the NFL, and there are seven referees on the pitch, looking at everything,\" says England cap centurion Danny Care.</p><p>\"All the stuff that has slowed the game down and confusing it at the moment is the stuff that's happening off the field with referrals and TMOs and bunker reviews,\" adds Grayson.</p><p>\"It's the sheer amount of time people off the playing surface are interjecting, or being asked to interject, that's making the games at times a bit of a mess.\"</p><p>Japan's Harry Hockings was given a red card for a tackle on Wales' Alex Mann, which was later overturned</p><p>Two new officiating protocols have come into the sport in the last few years, as the powers-that-be grapple over the tricky balance of prioritising player safety with keeping the game flowing, all the while giving the referee a helping hand.</p><p>The bunker system was established in 2023, with the aim to defer decision-making for foul play to an off-pitch official, who has 10 minutes to pore over the footage in private and judge whether a yellow card should be upgraded to a red card, while the game continues.</p><p>Meanwhile the 20-minute red card is designed to make sure that the offending player is punished rather than the paying punter. While the guilty party can't return to the field, they can be replaced after 20 minutes in a bid to not completely alter the spectacle.</p><p>Both the bunker and the 20-minute red cards are very solid concepts in theory, but in practice they are not foolproof.</p><p>On the opening weekend, Ireland forward Tadhg Beirne had his yellow card upgraded to a 20-minute red against the All Blacks. It was then overturned by a disciplinary panel.</p><p>South Africa's Franco Mostert received a full red card against Italy a fortnight later; again, this was rescinded.</p><p>On the same weekend Japan's Harry Hockings was given a red against Wales, which was also later scrubbed off, while Ireland supporters were up in arms as Springbok talisman Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu escaped censure for a clumsy challenge on Tommy O'Brien.</p><p>The officials are in an invidious position. Too many TMO checks, and too many stoppages, will turn off the fans. On the other hand, missing acts of foul play will also be latched on by coaches and supporters.</p><p>But it has been hard to tell this month what constitutes a penalty, what constitutes a card, and what colour that card should be.</p><p>Even the most informed rugby followers are scratching their heads.</p><p>\"There has to be a way of getting this right, rather than consistently getting it wrong and cards being rescinded. No wonder you are going to get very angry fans voicing their opinions,\" says Care.</p><p>Springbok lock Franco Mostert was shown a straight red card for a high hit against Italy, but it was later overturned upon being adjudged that he initially made contact lower down</p><p>The Autumn Debrief</p><p>Three Boks, four Englishmen - who makes Opta's team of the autumn?</p><p>A Grand Slam should be seen as 'stepping stone' - Dawson column</p><p>Former England and Lions wing Ugo Monye, who sits on World Rugby's High Performance committee, adds: \"There needs to be a recalibration. On some of those decisions, it felt obvious [what the decision should be] but for some reason this month it seems to have been poorly managed. I can live with the team of officials getting it wrong, but I have less grace with the bunker officials getting it wrong.\"</p><p>One suggestion is to drastically reduce the amount of TMO interference, empowering the on-field referee to make quick and unilateral decisions.</p><p>Another is to have high quality referees as TMOs, to give the on-field referees the best possible guidance.</p><p>Officials centrally contracted to World Rugby could also help with consistency, given referees interpret the game differently from league to league, tournament to tournament, and hemisphere to hemisphere.</p><p>Meanwhile luminaries in the game, such as Eddie Jones, have long advocated limiting the number of replacements in a bid to increase fatigue, open up space, and reduce the number of collisions.</p><p>For Ashton, referees need to get pace into the game from the off.</p><p>\"The refereeing has been bang average and it is frustrating the life out of me,\" he says.</p><p>\"Luke Pearce was outstanding in the France v Australia game. From minute one he was speeding the game up. But then we come to England v Argentina, and the referee is letting a player tie his shoelace for a minute.\"</p><p>\"The whole thing has been put under the spotlight, and World Rugby probably has to get hold of it,\" Care continues.</p><p>Despite the concerns, England boss Steve Borthwick feels the international game is in rude health.</p><p>\"I think Test rugby is in a really good place. So many games are going down to the final quarter with one score,\" he told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.</p><p>\"I sat and watched the Ireland against South Africa game and I thought it was gripping. Yes there were [lots of] TMOs, but there was a whole lot of tension within them. I think from a spectator point of view, it is very good.\"</p><p>\"We don't need to change it all and risk tweaking the laws too much,\" adds Monye.</p><p>\"For the best part of 18 months, I don't think there have been too many complaints about the game and how it's been refereed.</p><p>\"But I do think it has come to a head this autumn and I would love to see how it filters into the Six Nations. A tweak is needed, but not an overhaul.\"</p><p>The aforementioned Six Nations will be hugely anticipated, and should be another classic, while 2026 also sees the inaugural Nations Championship in the men's game. There is lots to look forward to.</p><p>That is followed in 2027 by the Rugby World Cup, which promises to be the biggest yet.

{"details":"<p>A “once in 300 year” storm has battered southern Thailand, bringing floodwaters more than eight feet high that in one city cut off access to a maternity ward holding 30 newborn babies, staff and officials said.</p><p>At least 19 people across southern Thailand have died, mainly caused by electrocution and flood-related accidents, according to the public health ministry.</p><p>The heaviest rain was seen in Hat Yai city, a major center of transportation and trade in Songkhla province, which recorded “the heaviest rain in 300 years,” according to the country’s Royal Irrigation Department. That figure refers to how rare this kind of rainstorm is, with a probability of occurring once every 300 years, officials told CNN.</p><p>As of Monday, nine provinces across southern Thailand are still flooded, affecting more than 127,000 households, according to local authorities. Some places have recorded nearly 400 millimeters (15.7 inches) of accumulated rain – exacerbated by overflowing rivers and flash floods.</p><p>In Hat Yai, floodwaters reached up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) in depth, sweeping through the city and inundating homes. Photos from the city show entire roads underwater, with houses half-submerged and emergency crews on boats rescuing residents and delivering supplies.</p><p>Workers at Hat Yai Hospital described a frantic scene on Tuesday, with water supplies and electricity partially cut off since Monday evening.</p><p>There are about 30 newborns in the infant ward whose parents aren’t at the hospital. “The hospital must take care of them,” said hospital nurse Fasiya Fatonni, adding that the babies’ parents “are worried but they can’t get here, the water is rising and all transportation is cut off.”</p><p>She shared photos of the infant ward, showing nurses sitting in a dark room lit only by a single lamp; standing fans have been positioned around the room to keep the newborns cool in their cribs.</p><p>The ward is on the hospital’s third floor, hopefully high enough that they won’t need to evacuate, she said.</p><p>But another nurse, Pattiya Ruamsook, is worried about the rising floods. “Yesterday, water covered only the first floor, now it has risen to the second floor,” she said.</p><p>About 500 people were in the hospital as of Tuesday, including 200 inpatients, she added, urging authorities to help deliver more drinking water to those stranded.</p><p>The irrigation department said on Monday it was working with various other government agencies and local officials to respond to the regional flooding, including sending trucks to deliver supplies and evacuate those in high-risk areas.</p><p>They’re also working to drain the floodwater as fast as possible, installing dozens of water pumps and propellers to divert floodwater into the nearby Songkhla Lake and the Gulf of Thailand, off the country’s east coast.</p><p>When the heavy rain ceases, the flooding in the southern provinces is expected to “gradually ease,” though authorities are keeping “special vigilance” for low-lying areas, according to the irrigation department.</p><p>The days-long downpours have also impacted neighboring countries. In Malaysia, more than 15,000 people were in shelters, though no deaths have been reported, according to Reuters.</p><p>Meanwhile in central Vietnam, flooding and landslides killed 91 people in the past week and left 1.1 million households and businesses without power – though water levels began receding on Monday, Reuters reported.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behaviour.</p><p>\"I'll make sure it never happens again.\"</p><p>Moyes said Gueye's team-mates applauded when the player stood in front of the group and apologised.</p><p>\"Big enough to stand up and say he made a mistake. I've accepted it, we all move on,\" added the Scot.</p><p>The Premier League Match Centre posted on X after Gueye was sent off: \"The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR - with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"</p><p>The law for violent conduct defines a sending off offence as striking an opponent or any other person, on the head or face with their hand or arm, unless the force used was negligible.</p><p>However, United boss Ruben Amorim disagreed with Gueye's red card.</p><p>\"We can fight with team-mates,\" said the Portuguese. \"I know it's violent conduct because the referee explained but I don't agree.\"</p><p>According to Opta, it is only the third time on record (since 2000-01) a player has been sent off in the Premier League for clashing with their own team-mate, after Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer - for Newcastle against Aston Villa in 2005 - and Ricardo Fuller with Andy Griffin for Stoke in 2008 against West Ham.</p><p>Memorable team-mate bust-ups after Gueye red card</p><p>Latest Everton news, analysis and fan views</p><p>Ask about Everton - what do you want to know?</p><p>Despite playing most of the game with 10 men, Everton won thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal.</p><p>Match-winner Dewsbury-Hall described the confrontation between Gueye and Keane as a \"moment of madness\".</p><p>\"It was avoidable. Idrissa has apologised to us at full-time, said his piece and that is all we can do,\" added the former Leicester City and Chelsea midfielder.</p><p>\"We have moved on from it.

We brought brilliant support here. For 80 minutes we were on the back foot.</p><p>\"To get over the line took a big job.\"</p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, former Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart said \"something must have been brewing\" between Gueye and Keane before the red card.</p><p>\"The referee wasn't even close enough to hear what Gueye was saying but he was in  Keane's face, who is considerably bigger than him and shoved him off with one arm,\" added Hart.</p><p>\"When he came over to continue the argument, the referee just casually walked over and sent him off.

He had an unobstructed view and clearly saw Gueye slap Keane around the face, so in the laws of football that would constitute to violent conduct and a red card is the right decision.</p><p>\"For Keane's push to be violent conduct, it would need to be on the face as opposed to on the chest.</p><p>\"Of course you can still be sent off if you punch somebody in the chest, but I would suggest that Keane's push away was more him telling Gueye to get off him.\"</p><p>Former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, speaking on Sky Sports, said he was \"very surprised\" at the clash.</p><p>\"There is a bit of a misunderstanding between them,\" added the Portugal boss.</p><p>\"The referee has no choice, the law tells you that is a red card.\"</p><p>Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, also speaking on Sky Sports, added: \"We are talking about a slap. Can the referee manage the situation [differently]? When you look at the laws, it gives the ref an out.\"</p><p>When team-mates fight - Dyer v Bowyer</p><p>Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, said the clash was not on the same scale as \"Bowyer v Dyer\".</p><p>The Newcastle team-mates were sent off in disgrace for fighting during their side's 3-0 home defeat by Aston Villa in 2005.</p><p>\"The major anger he showed was after he was sent off. It looked innocuous,\" added Neville. \"My gut feeling is yellow would have been enough.\"</p><p>Phil in Oxford: I'm a Manchester United fan and while the little slap was quite unbelievable, I don't think it merited a straight red. A yellow card is fine. While I understand it is 'violent conduct', he is gaining no advantage by slapping his own team-mate.</p><p>Jim, Fulham: I haven't seen anything like this since Lee Bowyer/Kieron Dyer.</p><p>Alan, Aberdeen: I cannot believe Michael Keane has told Idrissa Gueye to get off and sent him on his way. There is no way that is a red card and Keane should've surely tried to defuse the situation. I'm not impressed with him.</p><p>Adam, Rotherham: It might sound reactionary, but he can't play for Everton again. That is appalling. There is no apology big enough.

None of the climbers has been publicly identified, but the New Zealand Mountain Guides Association said in a statement that one of those who died was a member of their organization and the other was that guide’s client.</p><p>Sgt. Kevin McErlain told The Timaru Herald the pair had been connected by a rope when they fell near the summit of Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook.</p><p>The authorities learned late Monday night local time that four climbers needed help on the mountain, which is on New Zealand’s South Island. Two of the climbers were rescued by helicopter in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Walker said.</p><p>They were uninjured. Searchers in two helicopters looked throughout the night for the other climbers, who were found dead hours later.</p><p>Aoraki is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of the South Island.

Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.</p><p>Foreign climbers and Nepali guides among 7 killed in avalanche on Nepal mountain</p><p>More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century. Dozens of those who died on the mountain have never been found.</p><p>This includes three men, two from the United States and one from Canada, who were believed to have died on Aoraki in December 2024. The Americans — Kurt Blair, 56, from Colorado and Carlos Romero, 50, of California — were certified alpine guides.</p><p>The climbers were missing for five days before New Zealand authorities halted a search for them, saying discoveries of their belongings suggested the men had fallen to their deaths.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>\"Don't wait for permission.\" That's rising star Ellis Howard's advice to young artists who are hoping to cut through.</p><p>The 28-year-old actor, from Liverpool, says the course of his career changed when a handful of Instagram videos helped him to secure a writing agent and a mentor.</p><p>His posts, discussing issues such as inequality, were what got him noticed.</p><p>\"Do things on your own terms, for yourself and don't seek permission,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.</p><p>\"Just make the kind of art that you wanted to see growing up.\"</p><p>Ellis followed this path when he took on the lead role of 15-year-old Byron in the BBC Three teen drama, What It Feels Like For A Girl.</p><p>The series, inspired by the autobiography of trans writer, journalist and campaigner Paris Lees, follows a teenager from a working-class town near Nottingham as they wrestle with their gender identity.</p><p>The series,  praised by some critics for being \"raw\" and \"heartfelt\", also drew attention to Ellis' talent.</p><p>He has now been named as one of 20 creatives on this year's Bafta Breakthrough list.</p><p>The initiative, supported by Netflix, aims to spotlight people within gaming, TV and film who are on the verge or in the middle of a breakthrough moment.</p><p>Ellis says being included in the line-up \"means everything\" as it feels like \"a stamp of approval\" on his work. After receiving free arts training in Liverpool at Rare Studio, he secured a place at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama.</p><p>His past work also includes featuring in the 2022 BBC horror series Red Rose, and he later made his West End debut in Aaron Sorkin's adaption of To Kill A Mockingbird.</p><p>But he says being included in the Bafta list off the back of What It Feels Like For A Girl is particularly special for him, as he believes having representation of LGBTQ+ experiences on-screen is the \"most important thing\".</p><p>Ellis, who describes himself as working-class and queer, says the show is a \"mirror\" for those who can see themselves within the characters, while for others it is a \"door into a community that they've never had access to before\".</p><p>\"I think it's really important to see yourself, to understand that your story is important, and that your life deserves dignity,\" he says.</p><p>The coming-of-age story was released just weeks after the Supreme Court ruled that the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\" in April this year.</p><p>The campaign group For Women Scotland had brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people who are born female. The Scottish government had argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate were entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women - but it was defeated.</p><p>After the ruling, the judge stressed the law still gives protection against discrimination to trans people, but some campaign groups said it rolled back years of understanding.</p><p>There are concerns from some advocacy groups that there is a wider pushback against LGBTQ+ representation in entertainment.</p><p>A recent report by US-based organisation Glaad (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) found a \"continual decline\" in the number of LGBTQ+ characters on broadcast television, but an increase on streaming services.</p><p>Newsbeat has been told media watchdog Ofcom collects some diversity data on actors and presenters employed directly by broadcasters, but not on characters within shows.</p><p>Also on the Bafta Breakthrough list this year is Stanley Baxton, a 26-year-old narrative game developer originally from Warrington.</p><p>He has created games which he describes as \"satirical, horrifying or queer\" and reflect specific aspects of his life as a trans man in the UK.</p><p>\"You never see just a realistic, down-to-earth 'this is what trans people experience',\" he says.</p><p>\"It's often fluffier or a: 'Oh, we have a trans person in this, but we're not really gonna talk about it or talk about their experiences'.\"</p><p>In his previous job at a well-known UK game studio, Stanley says at least half of his team-mates were queer, but their personal experiences weren't often reflected in what they were making.</p><p>\"If the games industry refuses to give us the perspective that we have, we just have to force it ourselves,\" he says.</p><p>\"I feel like a slight remedy is the kind of stuff that I'm doing here.\"</p><p>A report released by Glaad last year found that less than 2% of games on major consoles and PC include LGBTQ+ characters, but nearly one in five active video game players identified as LGBTQ+.</p><p>Stanley hopes the Bafta Breakthrough initiative can draw more attention to the indie games space, where he believes better work is being done to explore and portray a diverse range of experiences.</p><p>\"Work's being done, the camera's just pointed in the wrong direction,\" he says.</p><p>Also among this year's Bafta breakthrough cohort is Laura Carreira, the writer and director of On Falling, which follows a Portuguese warehouse worker in Scotland,  Akinola Davies Jr, the director and co-writer of UK's international Oscar submission My Father's Shadow, and the casting producer behind Love is Blind UK series one, Vivian Eguridu.</p><p>Past Bafta Breakthrough artists include Oscar-nominated actress Florence Pugh, One Day's Ambika Mod and The Last Of Us star Bella Ramsey.</p><p>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.</p><p>The ruling covers the case of a Polish couple who married in Berlin but Polish authorities refused to recognise their marriage.</p><p>Comedy writer Graham Linehan \"deliberately whacked\" a teenage trans woman's phone out of her hand, a court heard.</p><p>Rivals, based on the Jilly Cooper novel, won best drama while Ludwig won the best comedy award.</p><p>Sarah and Jen Hopley now have both their names on their son's document after a major legal change.</p><p>Bailey Smith says it took time to take off his ring after ending his relationship with Rebecca Fenney.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>Under the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.</p><p>She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.</p><p>Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.</p><p>Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.</p><p>That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.</p><p>The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.</p><p>To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.</p><p>\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\"</p><p>Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.</p><p>In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall.</p><p>\"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"</p><p>But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.</p><p>The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.</p><p>To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.</p><p>\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.</p><p>\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"</p><p>To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"</p><p>The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.</p><p>So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.</p><p>\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"</p><p>The results were striking.</p><p>Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"</p><p>Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"</p><p>The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation.</p><p>If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.</p><p>\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"</p><p>Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.</p><p>If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.</p><p>As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.</p><p>England will face tournament debutants Italy at the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup while defending champions India and Pakistan will renew their rivalry in the group stage.</p><p>The general manager of a Buddhist temple was startled to see her \"opening her eyes\" as the coffin opened, AP news agency says.</p><p>South Africa are on the brink of a first Test series win in India for 25 years after reducing the hosts to 27-2 in pursuit of 549 on day four in Guwahati.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>India’s aviation regulator has asked airline operators to “strictly avoid\" volcanic ash affected areas.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>A three-year-old boy has astounded doctors with his progress after becoming the first person in the world with his devastating disease to receive a ground-breaking gene therapy.</p><p>Oliver Chu has a rare, inherited condition called Hunter syndrome - or MPSII - which causes progressive damage to the body and brain.</p><p>In the most severe cases, patients with the disease usually die before the age of 20. The effects are sometimes described as a type of childhood dementia.</p><p>Due to a faulty gene, before the treatment Oliver was unable to produce an enzyme crucial for keeping cells healthy.</p><p>In a world first, medical staff in Manchester have tried to halt the disease by altering Oliver's cells using gene therapy.</p><p>Prof Simon Jones, who is co-leading the trial tells the BBC: \"I've been waiting 20 years to see a boy like Ollie doing as well as he is, and it's just so exciting.\"</p><p>At the centre of this remarkable story is Oliver - the first of five boys around the world to receive the treatment - and the Chu family, from California, who have put their faith in the medical team at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</p><p>A year after starting the treatment, Oliver now appears to be developing normally.</p><p>\"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing,\" says his mother Jingru.</p><p>The BBC has followed Oliver's story for more than a year - including how scientists in the UK first developed the pioneering gene therapy and how the medical trial they are conducting almost didn't get off the ground due to lack of funds.</p><p>We first meet Oliver and his dad Ricky in December 2024 at the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Manchester Clinical Research Facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. It's a big day.</p><p>Since being diagnosed with Hunter syndrome in April,  Oliver's life - like that of his elder brother, Skyler, who also has the condition - has been dominated by hospital visits.</p><p>Skyler had shown some late development in speech and coordination, but this had initially been put down to being born during Covid.</p><p>Ricky tells me his sons' diagnosis came as a complete shock.</p><p>\"When you find out about Hunter syndrome, the first thing the doctor tells you is 'Don't go on the internet and look it up because you'll find the worst cases and you'll be very, very disheartened'.\"</p><p>\"But, like anybody, you look it up and you're like, 'Oh my goodness, is this what's going to happen to both my sons?'\"</p><p>Children are born apparently healthy, but around the age of two they start to show symptoms of the disease.</p><p>These vary and can include changes to physical features, stiffness of the limbs and short stature.  It can cause damage throughout the body, including to the heart, liver, bones and joints and in the most serious cases can lead to severe mental impairment and progressive neurological decline.</p><p>Hunter syndrome almost always occurs in boys. It's extremely rare, affecting one in 100,000 male births in the world.</p><p>Until now, the only medicine available for Hunter syndrome was Elaprase, which costs around £300,000 per patient, per year and can slow the physical effects of the disease. The drug is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and so does not help with cognitive symptoms.</p><p>But today, Oliver is being hooked up to a machine and having some of his cells removed - the first crucial step in trying to halt his genetic disorder in this one-off treatment.</p><p>\"His blood is being passed through a fancy machine that is collecting a specific type of cell called stem cells which will be sent to a lab to be modified and then given back to him,\" Dr Claire Horgan, consultant paediatric haematologist explains.</p><p>Oliver's cells are carefully packaged and sent to a laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London.</p><p>In Hunter syndrome, a genetic error means that cells are missing the instructions for making an enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), essential for breaking down large sugar molecules which over time accumulate in tissues and organs.</p><p>Scientists insert the missing IDS gene into a virus, which has its genetic material removed so that it can't cause disease.</p><p>A similar method has been used in other gene therapies, such as the treatment for another rare inherited condition, MLD.</p><p>Dr Karen Buckland, from the Cell and Gene Therapy Service at GOSH and UCL senior research fellow, explains: \"We use the machinery from the virus to insert a working copy of the faulty gene into each of the stem cells.</p><p>\"When those go back to Oliver, they should repopulate his bone marrow and start to produce new white blood cells and each of these will hopefully start to produce the missing protein [enzyme] in his body.\"</p><p>There still remains the issue of how to get enough of the missing enzyme into the brain.</p><p>To overcome this, the inserted gene is modified so that the enzyme it produces crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently.</p><p>We next meet Oliver back at the clinical research facility at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.</p><p>This time he's with his mum Jingru, while Ricky has stayed in California to look after Skyler.</p><p>There is a sense of anticipation as a member of the research team opens a large metal cryopreservation tank where Oliver's gene edited stem cells are frozen, having been transported back from GOSH.</p><p>A small, clear infusion bag is removed and slowly brought to body temperature in a tray of liquid.</p><p>After multiple checks, a nurse draws the clear fluid containing around 125 million gene-modified stem cells, into a syringe.</p><p>Oliver is used to hospitals, but is fretful, and wriggles as the research nurse slowly injects the treatment, about a cup full, into a catheter in his chest.</p><p>Jingru holds Oliver steady in her arms. After 10 minutes, the infusion is done.</p><p>An hour later, a second, identical infusion is made. Oliver continues to watch cartoons on a portable screen, oblivious to the potential importance of what's just happened.</p><p>And that's it. The gene therapy is complete. It seems to be all over rather quickly, yet the ambition here is huge: to stop Oliver's progressive disease in its tracks, in a one-off treatment.</p><p>After a couple of days, Oliver and Jingru fly back to California. Now the family, and the medical team must wait to see if the gene therapy has worked.</p><p>In May, Oliver is back in Manchester for crucial tests to see if the gene therapy is working. This time the whole family is here.</p><p>We meet in a park in central Manchester and it's immediately clear that things are looking good.</p><p>Oliver is more mobile and inquisitive than I've seen him. Admittedly, he now has the freedom to play and is out of hospital, but he appears brighter and healthier.</p><p>Ricky is thrilled: \"He's doing really well. We have seen him progressing in his speech, and mobility. In just three months he has matured.\"</p><p>The really big news is that Oliver has been able to come off the weekly infusion of the missing enzyme.</p><p>\"I want to pinch myself every time I tell people that Oliver is making his own enzymes,\" says Jingru. \"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing.\"</p><p>She tells me he is \"so different\" from before the treatment, is talking \"a ton\" and is engaging more with other children.</p><p>It is lovely to finally meet five-year-old Skyler who is very protective and caring towards his younger brother.</p><p>\"My wish upon the star is for Skyler, to be able to get the same treatment,\" says Ricky. \"It feels like Oliver has got a reset in his life, and I want the same thing for Skyler, even though he's a bit older.\"</p><p>Initially it was thought that Oliver was too old for the trial, as the treatment cannot reverse existing damage, but tests showed he was still largely unaffected.</p><p>Skyler seems to take delight in the world around him, and is keen to hold my hand and chat as we walk to the park.</p><p>Ricky explains that Skyler has delayed development in speech and motor skills, but is undergoing infusion therapy, which gets the treatment to his body, but not his brain.</p><p>Oliver returns to Manchester every three months for a few days of follow-up tests.</p><p>In late August, further checks confirm the gene therapy is working.</p><p>Oliver is clearly thriving, and to date is now nine months post treatment.</p><p>Prof Jones, whom Oliver calls Santa because of his white beard, is beaming: \"Before the transplant Ollie didn't make any enzyme at all and now he's making hundreds of times the normal amount.</p><p>\"But more importantly, we can see he's improving, he's learning, he's got new words and new skills and he's moving around much more easily.\"</p><p>However, Prof Jones exercises a degree of caution: \"We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time.\"</p><p>On the rooftop garden at the hospital, Oliver plays with his dad.</p><p>\"He's like a completely different child. He's running around everywhere, he won't stop talking,\" says Ricky.</p><p>\"The future for Ollie seems very bright and hopefully this means more kids will get the treatment.\"</p><p>In all, five boys have been signed up for the trial, from the US, Europe and Australia.  None are from the UK as patients here were diagnosed too late to qualify.</p><p>All the boys will be monitored for at least two years. If the trial is deemed a success, the hospital and university hope to partner with another biotech firm in order to get the treatment licensed.</p><p>Prof Jones says the same gene therapy approach is being applied to other gene disorders.</p><p>There are similar treatments on trial in Manchester for MPS type 1 or Hurler syndrome and MPS type 3 or Sanfilippo syndrome.</p><p>Ricky and Jingru say they are \"eternally grateful\" to the Manchester team for allowing Oliver to join the trial.</p><p>They say they are astonished by his progress in recent months.</p><p>Oliver's now producing the missing enzyme and his body and brain are healthy.</p><p>\"I don't want to jinx it, but I feel like it's gone very, very well,\" says Ricky.</p><p>\"His life is no longer dominated by needles and hospital visits. His speech, agility and cognitive development have all got dramatically better.</p><p>\"It's not just a slow, gradual curve as he gets older, it has shot up exponentially since the transplant.\"</p><p>Researchers at the University of Manchester led by Prof Brian Bigger had spent more than 15 years working on creating the gene therapy for Hunter syndrome.</p><p>In 2020 the university announced a partnership with a small US biotech company Avrobio, to conduct a clinical trial.</p><p>But three years later the company handed back the licence to the university, following poor results from another gene therapy study and a lack of funds.</p><p>The first-in-human trial, which would soon help Oliver, was in jeopardy before it had even begun.</p><p>Prof Jones: \"We had to move very quickly to try to save the whole idea and find another sponsor and another source of funding.\"</p><p>It was then that British medical research charity, LifeArc, stepped in, providing £2.5m of funding.</p><p>CEO Dr Sam Barrell said: \"A huge challenge for the more than 3.5 million people in the UK living with rare conditions, is getting access to effective treatments – currently 95% of conditions have none. \"</p><p>The Chu family are relieved the trial didn't come to a halt and now hope Skyler may one day benefit from the same gene therapy as his brother.</p><p>\"I would walk to the end of the earth, backwards, forwards, upside down, barefoot, to make sure my kids have a better future,\" says Ricky.</p><p>Additional reporting Nat Wright and Brijesh Patel</p><p>Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.</p><p>Milkshakes and lattes to be included in UK sugar tax scheme for the first time.</p><p>Tributes are paid to the renowned surgeon who carried out the UK's first successful heart transplant.</p><p>Brain scans on thousands of people reveal the dramatic shifts the brain goes through between birth and death.</p><p>Felicity Rackstraw, from Stoke-on-Trent, ran the My Traitorous Tit blog.</p><p>Former addict John Wade says he gambled on \"anything and everything\" for 46 years.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>It was at a landmark architecture exhibition in Paris in 1925 that the Art Deco aesthetic first exploded on the scene.</p><p>In the 100 years since, the glamorous building style - evocative of neon-lit jazz bars and the golden age of big motion pictures - rapidly spread around the world.</p><p>It moved from the famous pastel hotel facades of Miami's South Beach to the sprawling necklace of mansion apartments along Mumbai's Marine Drive seafront.</p><p>Art Deco's distinct motifs - typified by geometrical ziggurats (step towers), sweeping curves, sunburst designs, nautical elements and circular or turreted rooftops - symbolised an unequivocal break from the past, celebrating the dawn of a new, unabashed, post-war 20th Century modern age.</p><p>In a short time, the style transcended architecture to influence the design sensibility of home interiors, furniture, fonts, jewellery and some of the world's most iconic cinema halls - from Radio City Music Hall in New York City to Regal, Liberty and Eros cinemas in Mumbai.</p><p>\"It represented hope, optimism and speed, coinciding with the emergence of the motor car and also concrete as a building material, which when compared with stone, could be worked with in a tenth of the time and fifth of the cost,\" Atul Kumar, founder of the Art Deco Mumbai Trust, told the BBC. He's also curator of a new exhibition conceptualised by the Art Deco Alive festival.</p><p>\"It was not elaborate like Victorian Gothic design that preceded it, and came with a classicism and simplicity that has survived the test of time,\" he said.</p><p>And nowhere has that been more apparent than in Mumbai, which, according to Mr Kumar, is home to the world's largest documented collection of Art Deco buildings. Other estimates put Mumbai in the second spot behind Miami.</p><p>What made Mumbai's tryst with Art Deco particularly interesting was how the city embraced its hallmarks in a truly all-encompassing manner.</p><p>Just like Miami, the style emerged in the city at a time of economic flux and transformation, spurred by its modern, mercantile port-city energy.</p><p>But unlike Miami where it \"arrived as a projection of leisure or spectacle\", in Mumbai the \"style resonated across various building typologies, including schools, cinemas, bungalows, petrol stations and banks,\" Mr Kumar said.</p><p>Art Deco buildings in Mumbai were, and still often are, hidden in plain sight, with even their occupants often blissfully unaware of their cultural moorings.</p><p>But their all-pervading architectural shadow over the city is perhaps why Art Deco is \"seeped into the larger public imagination, and remains relevant in Mumbai's emotional quotient\", Mr Kumar added.</p><p>The style was brought to Mumbai at a time when it was under colonial rule.</p><p>It was India's first bunch of home-grown architects - pivotal figures like Chimanlal Master, Laxman Vishnu Sathe and Gopalji Mulji Bhuta - who integrated it into their designs after returning home with degrees from the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.</p><p>\"They were suddenly exposed to new European sensibilities and wanted to bring them back to their country, which was deeply colonised by the imposition of Victorian buildings,\" Mr Kumar said.</p><p>But they adapted Art Deco and vernacularised it, throwing in native design patterns, drawing inspiration from disparate local elements including ocean liners docked at Mumbai's ports and even lattice screens that are so typical of Mughal architecture.</p><p>The British were initially dismissive, calling Art Deco \"lesser architecture\", but were presumably threatened, said Mr Kumar, as it signalled the dawn of a new age and of new identities that were shaping India's public spaces.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before South Mumbai's skyline would become a rich confluence of Indo-Saracenic, Gothic and Art Deco buildings.</p><p>Today, Mumbai is yet again a city in rapid flux - its building code governed by real estate moguls trying to maximise the floor space index, giving way to utilitarian rather than stylistic considerations.</p><p>Dozens of Art Deco buildings have been erased to give way to glass and steel facades, and hundreds more are under threat.</p><p>Over the past decade, Mr Kumar has documented more than 1,500 buildings that are truly representative of the style, but only 70-odd of those are protected.</p><p>Authorities are apathetic to their preservation, so his organisation is engaging directly with people, offering pro-bono repair and restoration consultancies to prevent them from giving away their properties to builders for redevelopment.</p><p>\"The response has been positive as people have seen the value of their real estate go up after the renovations,\" said Mr Kumar.</p><p>Then there are others, like architect and designer Nidhi Tekwani, who is re-imagining Art Deco objects and hoping to adapt them for a contemporary context.</p><p>For example, Art Deco furniture was often bulky, its light fittings were meant for high ceilings, and its dressing tables too elaborate for today's compact apartments. Ms Tekwani aims to design and launch products that are sleeker while preserving core Art Deco principles.</p><p>\"The hope is to translate it to something modern and well-fitting of our current lifestyle requirements,\" said Ms Tekwani of her efforts to keep Art Deco a living tradition in a city that's remaking itself between one blink and the next.</p><p>Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.</p><p>England will face tournament debutants Italy at the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup while defending champions India and Pakistan will renew their rivalry in the group stage.</p><p>The general manager of a Buddhist temple was startled to see her \"opening her eyes\" as the coffin opened, AP news agency says.</p><p>South Africa are on the brink of a first Test series win in India for 25 years after reducing the hosts to 27-2 in pursuit of 549 on day four in Guwahati.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>India’s aviation regulator has asked airline operators to “strictly avoid\" volcanic ash affected areas.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

I think it's great,\" he said. \"I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood.\"</p><p>Grint, 37, who played Ron in all eight of the franchise's movies, also revealed he has written a letter to the child actor playing Ron in the upcoming TV series.</p><p>\"It's quite strange to have the cycle happening again,\" he said. \"I'm really intrigued what it's going to be like.\"</p><p>Grint was speaking to BBC News at an event to switch on the Christmas lights in Highgate, north London, on Wednesday.</p><p>The actor, who lives locally with his partner, actress Georgia Groome, and their two daughters, drew a crowd of fans to the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution and Highgate Society.</p><p>As children, Grint and his co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had their lives transformed by their wizarding roles in the big-screen adaptation of JK Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.</p><p>Grint was 11 when he was cast as Ron - who is characterised as one of Harry Potter's best friends at Hogwarts - and now describes the experience as being \"crazy\".</p><p>\"It changed my whole life quite quickly,\" he said. \"I was a huge fan of the books, so for me it was like stepping into the books, and that was very special.\"</p><p>Grint has switched on the Christmas lights in Highgate in the past as well.</p><p>The festive free event was arranged by volunteers from the local community and funded by local businesses, schools and residents.</p><p>Since the Potter films ended, Grint has had roles in films including Into the White, and in Apple TV series Servant. He's also appeared on stage, and in a number of Ed Sheeran's music videos.</p><p>He told us he has \"a couple of things\" coming up next year, though he is not able to talk about them yet.</p><p>But compared with Radcliffe and Watson, Grint has found it relatively hard to break out of his Potter role.</p><p>Is he fed up of always being linked to a part he played decades ago? \"No, absolutely not, I love it,\" he said.</p><p>\"It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It's great. It gives me a lot of pride. It was such a huge thing.</p><p>\"I don't think I'll ever quite step out of his shadow, but I'm fine with that.\"</p><p>The three child actors who will play Harry, Ron and Hermione in the new HBO series were announced in May.</p><p>Earlier this week, Radcliffe revealed he had sent a letter to Dominic McLaughlin, who is taking over the role of Harry.</p><p>McLaughlin, 11, is also starring in a new iPlayer drama, Gifted, which starts on Monday on CBBC and iPlayer.</p><p>Grint told us he has also written a letter to Alastair Stout, who will play Ron.</p><p>\"I wrote him a letter, before they started, passing the baton as it were,\" he said.</p><p>\"It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience,\" he said.</p><p>Grint said that when the new actors were announced, it took him \"straight back\" to when he, Radcliffe and Watson were cast. \"I still remember every second of it,\" he said.</p><p>He sees \"a bit of family resemblance\" between himself and Stout.</p><p>\"I think it's great that it's a whole new thing. It's going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun,\" he added.</p><p>He wouldn't discourage his children if they wanted to take on roles in the TV adaptation in the future, though.</p><p>\"I don't see why not. It was so much fun,\" he said.</p><p>Grint added the films were \"still a little bit too scary\" for his five-year-old daughter, named Wednesday, but she has watched some clips. \"And she loves it,\" he added.</p><p>While Grint has largely been less prolific since the heyday of the Harry Potter films, in 2020, he was one of several stars of the Potter franchise who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author spoke out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.</p><p>As a row grew, the writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.</p><p>In September, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refused to \"cancel her out\" despite their differences on the subject.</p><p>But her remarks were met with a stinging response from Rowling, who dismissed her as \"ignorant\".</p><p>Grint, for his part, declined to comment on the row when we asked him about it on Wednesday.</p><p>Could the future spell a return to wizardry for Grint? When asked whether he would follow in the footsteps of co-star Tom Felton - who recently returned as Draco Malfoy on Broadway - he said: \"Maybe in the future. Never say never.\"</p><p>\"But for now, I think as much as I loved it, I'm enjoying stepping outside of that world,\" he added - even as Ron's shadow looms large.</p><p>And if that wizardry could offer him the benefit of hindsight, which Hogwarts house would he be sorted into?</p><p>\"I think I'm probably more Hufflepuff than Gryffindor,\" he admits.</p><p>\"I like the vibe of Hufflepuff, I think.

{"details":"<p>A woman in Thailand shocked temple staff when she started moving in her coffin after being brought in for cremation.</p><p>Wat Rat Prakhong Tham, a Buddhist temple in the province of Nonthaburi on the outskirts of Bangkok, posted a video on its Facebook page, showing a woman lying in a white coffin in the back of a pick-up truck, slightly moving her arms and head, leaving temple staff bewildered.</p><p>Pairat Soodthoop, the temple’s general and financial affairs manager, told The Associated Press on Monday that the 65-year-old woman’s brother drove her from the province of Phitsanulok to be cremated.</p><p>He said they heard a faint knock coming from the coffin.</p><p>“I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin, and everyone was startled,” he said. “I saw her opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin.

{"details":"<p>Hidden for decades from public view, the artist's Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer has now sold at auction for a record sum. Why is it so valuable?</p><p>A mysterious and relatively little-known painting by Gustav Klimt is now the most expensive work of modern art ever to sell at auction and the most expensive ever to be sold by Sotheby's. The teasingly complex canvas, a full-length portrait of Elisabeth Lederer, the daughter of the Austrian artist's most committed patrons, fetched $236.4m (£180m) in New York on 18 November, far outpacing the price paid two years ago for Klimt's Lady with a Fan, 1917-18, which broke records when it sold for $108m (£82m) in London in 2023, making it the most expensive painting ever sold at auction in Europe.</p><p>The sale saw Klimt's canvas pass Andy Warhol's portrait of Marilyn Monroe, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, 1964 (which sold at Christie's in New York in 2022 for $195m), to become the second priciest work of art ever to go under the hammer, behind Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World), c 1500, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m (£343m). But what is it about this nearly 2m-tall likeness of a 20 year-old heiress, whose eerily elongated figure seems to chrysalise in a cocoon-like gown of shimmering white silk, that commands such a jaw-dropping price tag?</p><p>On its surface, Bildnis Elisabeth Lederer (Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer), 1914-16, may seem to lack the overt opulence of better-known paintings from Klimt's so-called \"Golden Period\", the era in which he produced such glimmering works as his Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, 1907, and The Kiss, 1907-8. Where those sumptuous masterpieces glisten with the glamour of the Vienna Secession (the influential movement emphasising artistic freedom that Klimt helped found), the lyrical likeness of Lederer, created in the last years of the artist's life (Klimt died in 1918, aged 55), pulses with a more psychologically teasing intensity. The canvas's aesthetic riches are copious, if more concealed.</p><p>Seized by Nazi officials, who confiscated the Lederer's vast collection of Klimts after Austria's annexation in 1938, the portrait resurfaced into the market in the early 1980s. It was then that it entered the private holdings of the billionaire heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics fortune, Leonard A Lauder, who died in June 2025. Hidden for decades from public view, the portrait has, in a sense, been biding its time, waiting to return to the spotlight. Whatever the price tag, the mysterious work is poised finally to reveal its secrets. Its extraordinary story blurs fact and symbolism into a richly charged visual tapestry whose intrigue extends into and outside the painting's surface.</p><p>Undertaken in the opening years of World War One, the portrait's prismatic exaltation of Lederer – the daughter of August and Serena Lederer, one of Vienna's wealthiest Jewish families – can be read as the last glorious gasp of the Golden Age from which it emerged. At first glance, the elaborate array of deceptively ornamental East Asian-influenced motifs – that orbit the young woman in a dazzling timeless stage of celestial blue – and the implosive calm of her dark eyes transport us from the accelerating turmoil of European history, transcending time and place. The audacity of gold on which Klimt previously relied has not so much disappeared as been transmuted, in a kind of reverse alchemy, into a fearlessness of vibrant, evocative colour that borders on the boldness of Expressionism.</p><p>Look closer and the portrait bristles with teasing and culturally complex details. Within the design of Elisabeth's elaborate robe and gown, Klimt has woven an enchanting conspiracy of shapes. These echo the contours of symbols and forms drawn eclectically from East Asian art and from the world of microscopic medical imagery that was just coming into sharper focus within the scientific circles in which Klimt moved in Vienna. The dragons on her robe are reminiscent of Qing Dynasty textiles, where such creatures represent cosmic authority and the divinely sanctioned authority of the emperor. Their slow, circling movement around Elisabeth's thighs, rising from stylised waves, gives her an almost mythic presence as a tamer of the elements and supernatural beasts. By immortalising Elisabeth's beauty in such mythic terms, Klimt is not simply flattering his patrons. He is, in effect, reinventing Botticelli's Birth of Venus for a new age.</p><p>More like this:</p><p>• Why this 1768 painting could be the birth of modern art</p><p>• The clues hidden in a true crime masterpiece</p><p>• Why there's more to Man Ray's iconic nude than it seems</p><p>But there's more. Offsetting this grand, imported iconography from East Asia are subtler shapes that call to mind the infinitesimal biomorphic forms with which Klimt became preoccupied while attending lectures on cell theory and anatomy delivered by his friend Emil Zuckerkandl, the Chair of Anatomy and Pathology at the University of Vienna, in 1903. A closer look at Elisabeth's intricate garments reveals a scatter of ovoid and concentric circles that can easily be dismissed as mere floral decoration. These soft, looping amorphous forms and cell-like motifs rhyme richly with similar shapes that appear in several of Klimt's earlier works, where writers have linked their presence to the artist's growing interest in embryology, haematology, and the structures of early life.</p><p>Read across such works, including Klimt's earlier paintings Danaë, 1907, and The Kiss, these cellular shapes begin to cohere into an inchoate language that only Klimt could coin. By juxtaposing symbols of imperial power with hints of biological origins and bloodlines, he creates a portrait that works on ever deepening levels of ancient mythology and modern science.</p><p>More remarkably still, these subtle references to lineage and identity cast an uncanny light on what happened to Elisabeth years later, under Nazi rule. Decades after Klimt's death, in the late 1930s, Elisabeth found herself facing increasing restrictions and growing peril because of her Jewish ancestry. In an extraordinary act of self-preservation, she falsely claimed that Klimt, a non-Jewish artist known for his many romantic affairs, was in fact her biological father. Elisabeth's mother, Serena, corroborated her daughter's fabricated claim by signing a sworn affidavit. The authorities accepted the fiction and granted Elisabeth a revised status that protected her.</p><p>Elisabeth's story, both inside and outside the frame of Klimt's mysterious portrait, is one of extraordinary transformation, rebirth and metamorphic survival. Zoom back out from the tight tease of subtle shapes that define the texture of the exquisite garments that Klimt wove for her, and the young woman's very physique seems surreally to mirror the proportions of a butterfly (a recurring motif in Klimt's art) just breaking free from its silken chrysalis. Her colourful gown, falling elegantly behind her, suddenly has the look of slick, prismatic wings about to spread dazzlingly wide. Whether Klimt's late masterpiece is deserving of the astonishing sum it has just fetched, there is little doubting the power and pricelessness of his portrait's endlessly regenerative genius.</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Artist Dasic Fernández turns grey streets in New York, Santiago and Diriyah into colorful 3D landscapes.</p><p>Find out how the ornate ceramics known as Iznik tiles hold the key to a forgotten golden age of Turkish art.</p><p>Ancient documents made with washi, the hand-crafted Japanese paper, are proof of its remarkable longevity.</p><p>Passed down through generations in Gokayama, the Japanese tradition of Kokiriko honours the cycle of life.</p><p>The Japanese photographer who buried hundreds of photos and the journey to revive his legacy.</p><p>How America's first professional female tattooist broke through into an art form historically dominated by men.</p><p>BBC Click visits a simulator lab that allows musicians to practice performance in real-world conditions.</p><p>BBC Click heads behind the scenes of the Sydney Opera House to explore the tech powering the famous landmark.</p><p>In 1948 a famous artist and an innovative portrait photographer attempted to create something unbelievable.</p><p>Find out how Japan's renowned Wajima-nuri lacquerware is crafted through more than 100 intricate steps.</p><p>The BBC gets access to Michelangelo's 'secret hiding room' under the Medici Chapel in Florence.</p><p>We find out how AI blurs the line between creation and automation, raising questions about the essence of art.</p><p>The prehistoric paintings in Magura Cave in Bulgaria are made using a surprising material.</p><p>The 'Shahmaran', half-woman and half-snake, is a mythical figure popular in the folklore of Turkey.</p><p>Discreetly located in a sleepy Venetian square, Palazzo Fortuny surprises whomever ventures in.</p><p>Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has enjoyed one of the longest careers in operatic history.</p><p>Zeinab Badawi heads to Athens to celebrate the centenary of the birth of opera soprano Maria Callas.</p><p>Art critic Alastair Sooke travels to Doha to discover some of the treasures of the Museum of Islamic Art.</p><p>Art critic Alastair Sooke learns about a decorative 10th-Century treasure at Doha's Museum of Islamic Art.</p><p>Art critic Alastair Sooke learns about a masterpiece of the Islamic world at Doha's Museum of Islamic Art.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

For information about how the series is funded and more, check out our FAQs.</p><p>All the names of women have been changed at their request to protect their identity.</p><p>An hour north of the city, where urban sprawl gives way to hills, a boy in a Batman shirt waits by the front of his family’s small convenience store.</p><p>Eagerly, he accompanies us past the candy, snacks and lottery tickets, to the simple living space at the rear.</p><p>He tells us his name, that he is three years old, and he misses his mom.</p><p>The boy’s aunt Rose and his grandparents have been looking after him and his younger brother since April, when their mother, Lily, took what she thought was a customer service job in Taiwan.</p><p>Instead, Lily became one of hundreds of thousands of people who have been trafficked to work in the heart of Asia’s notorious scam industry. For months, Lily says she has been held captive and tortured in Myanmar – details Rose keeps from the rest of the family to protect them from further heartache.</p><p>In the few messages Lily has sent Rose, she says “she wants to die there,” Rose told CNN. Rose’s reply is always the same: “Please don’t do that…your kid always asks me when you will go home.”</p><p>Experts say traffickers are increasingly targeting women to fill roles in their expanding scam operations – using their faces and voices for online romance schemes. In some cases, the women are forced into sex work to serve the men inside compounds that function like self-contained cities.</p><p>In the Philippines, where stable, well-paid jobs are scarce, many women take higher-earning roles abroad and send money home to pay for their children’s education, buy homes or support their parents.</p><p>But when criminal networks exploit this hope and desperation, families like Lily’s are robbed of mothers, sisters, daughters – and breadwinners.</p><p>In a months-long investigation, CNN spoke to several women who described horrifying conditions inside the compounds, where they were forced to con victims – ordinary people from America to Australia – in romance scams, investment schemes and more.</p><p>Women working inside – who hail not just from Asia, but also from Africa and Europe – told CNN they were made to memorize scripts and use AI face and voice filters to lure victims. Those failing to comply are punished with violence and sexual abuse, they said.</p><p>Many of the scam compounds operating across Southeast Asia are run by Chinese crime syndicates. Rose says trafficked women like her sister “were promised a good life and a good salary… but when they go there it’s really the opposite.”</p><p>“It looks like hell.”</p><p>It’s a hell Casie knows well.</p><p>The single mother-of-four was already well-versed in working abroad to support her young family, having previously been employed as a sales assistant in Dubai. So, when she saw a job for a customer service representative in Hong Kong, advertised by another Filipina on Facebook in January, she didn’t hesitate to pack her bags.</p><p>The job in Hong Kong was a fake. Instead, Casie was trafficked to Cambodia and forced to run extortion scams.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Casie recited to CNN the script she was forced to read: “Hi, good day. My name is Casie. I’m calling from Verizon. May I speak to Mr. John?” Casie paused for a heartbeat before delivering her verbal blow: “Your SIM card is used for fraudulent messages, money laundering and buying an illegal gun. After two hours we report you.”</p><p>Casie said her company was one of dozens operating out of the same building – ranging from romance, investment and loan scams to other crimes like drug and wildlife trafficking.</p><p>Casie, though, wanted no part of it. One day she saw a Facebook post from her recruiter, advertising the sale of Filipino workers for 60,000 pesos (about $1,000) per person. It was more than she could bear.</p><p>Furious, Casie confronted the recruiter face-to-face. “Why would you do this to us? You’re also a Filipino. We’re Filipinos. Why would you do it to us? You lied to us!” she recalled yelling, as she punched the woman until she bled.</p><p>“Deep inside I was scared,” Casie said of the confrontation. After months of corporal punishment – forced standing and withheld meals – she feared she would be killed for fighting back.</p><p>Casie was rescued in April with the help of the Philippine Embassy in Cambodia. Embassies of countries with a large victim population have taken a leading role in negotiating releases and pressuring local governments to raid scam compounds.</p><p>But diplomacy only goes so far in Cambodia and particularly Myanmar, where the areas hosting compounds are fought over by armed groups. In some cases, trafficking victims have no option but to make a run for it on their own.</p><p>When women like Lily and Casey work abroad, others must step in to keep the household running. Usually, their earnings help — but when such women are trapped in servitude, those gaps become all but impossible to fill.</p><p>Charlotte’s daughter was trafficked to Myanmar in January, leaving six children behind. “It is so hard to raise them, to feed them, to send them to school,” she said of housing her grandchildren in her small home south of Manila. “I had to sell most of our things. We barely have electricity or water. There’s nothing left.”</p><p>For Charlotte, the local families of other trafficked women have become a lifeline – they meet in each other’s homes, share information and pass along updates from inside the scam compounds, no matter how gut-wrenching those messages may be.</p><p>She showed CNN photos of her daughter’s injuries – bruises across her body, even on her bottom. All of it, Charlotte says, is evidence of abuse.</p><p>On two occasions, Charlotte said her daughter told her she was ordered to strip naked in front of her bosses who filmed her for clients to watch. “She had no bra. She was naked. She was ashamed,” Charlotte said. “I cry when I remember it.”</p><p>Most women are trafficked to the compounds to work as scammers, Daniele Marchesi, Philippines country manager of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), told CNN. “But if you’re not performing, you might be moved to another building within the facility and given another kind of duty.”</p><p>Sex trafficking in the compounds can take many forms – from forced sex work to acts of sexual violence used as punishment, according to the UNODC.</p><p>Stories of sexual abuse inside scam compounds are common, though the details are often difficult to confirm.</p><p>For months, these families have been pleading with the Philippine government for help in bringing their loved ones back, to no avail.</p><p>“I want to ask them,” Rose said, “are you going to wait until somebody dies before you do something?”</p><p>Gilbert Cruz, former executive director of the Philippines’ Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, told CNN that the issue goes beyond his country’s control.</p><p>“This is a worldwide problem. If some countries allow these things to happen, our people will go there thinking that they will be earning more,” he said in September, while still in the role.</p><p>“As far as our country is concerned, we’re doing our best to protect our people and also to give them what’s right for them,” he said, listing things such as “having a decent life,” “a nice, decent job” and “access to education.”</p><p>Most of Southeast Asia’s scam compounds are located in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. However, in September CNN was given a rare glimpse of a former compound in a small town in the Philippines, three hours north of Manila.</p><p>The nearly 10-hectare property, complete with mansions and an Olympic-sized swimming pool for the bosses, was raided by the government’s anti-organized crime agency last year. Since then, it has remained largely untouched, offering a snapshot into the secretive world of the scam industry.</p><p>Stepping inside, cobwebs cover a sprawling office space that could easily seat a few hundred workers. Computer monitors are piled in a corner, and unused SIM cards are scattered on tables alongside notebooks with step-by-step guides to scamming. One such booklet titled “A Complete Guide to Advancing Relationships and Communicating (Five Phases)” teaches scammers how to woo victims and time their investment pitches. Scripted lines include: “I hope we’re in love now and can earn our future wealth.”</p><p>In what appears to be the boss’ office, a 24-pack of Red Bull energy drinks sits on the desk alongside migraine medication.</p><p>In the shared dorms, bras, makeup and snack wrappers are left scattered on a bed, as if the occupants were forced to leave in a hurry.</p><p>On the other side of the compound, a five-story mansion overlooks the city-sized camp. This is where Philippine officials said fugitive Huang Zhiyang, the accused China-born criminal boss, lived with his family and staff. Religious figurines adorn the house; an entire room serving as a shrine and offering a glimpse into Huang’s superstitions and efforts to protect himself.</p><p>On the top floor, behind double-bolted doors, lies Huang’s bedroom and study – a Montessori parenting book and English language textbooks sit on his bedside table and desk.</p><p>A wine cellar stocked with Macallan Scotch whisky and snake wine conceals a secret tunnel that Philippine authorities allege Huang used to escape the property. His current whereabouts is unknown, and officials have issued an arrest warrant on human trafficking charges.</p><p>The wealth on display offers an insight into the revenue generated by a single compound in this billion-dollar industry. It also raises questions about how a place like this could be built in a sleepy town without arousing suspicion.</p><p>In the past two years the Marcos administration has cracked down on scam centers, also referred to domestically as Philippine offshore gaming operators (or POGOs). The POGOs – offering online gambling services for largely Chinese customers – were initially welcomed by the former Duterte government for their investment and job opportunities. But they quickly morphed into staging sites for human trafficking and forced labor.</p><p>Dismantling the compounds littered across the country has proven tough for authorities; They say they have had to contend with some local officials allegedly involved in the scam operations and highly sophisticated criminal gangs.</p><p>Scammers are becoming more sophisticated, too. In Telegram chats, they share and sell tools and resources – such as photo packages to other scammers, so they can convince victims that they’ve holidayed in Paris, or have bought a house in Los Angeles with their newly acquired wealth.</p><p>Scammers are also sharing advanced automated translation models, and most importantly, AI face and voice filters, said Marchesi, from the UNODC.</p><p>Originally from South Africa, Sara told CNN she used these filters to play Asian characters while working as a “model” inside the notorious KK Park scam compound on the Thai-Myanmar border.</p><p>“I was Linda, I was Jenny. They were Asian girls, but they all have different personality,” she said. “One had a child, one didn’t have a child. One was outgoing, one was reserved.”</p><p>Sara said she was trafficked to the compound under the guise of an IT job in 2022. Bosses quickly took a liking to her perfect English and gave her the name Cessa, short for Princessa.</p><p>When a victim was ready to invest big, models like Sara would be brought in for a voice or video call to seal the deal. She said she was one of a handful of models assisting several hundred scammers in the company. With little notice, Sara said she would study the scammers’ chat histories and use AI face filters to become whoever they had been pretending to be.</p><p>“You basically become an actor, you have to memorize your scripts,” Sara said. “You haven’t slept, you’ve been tortured, and you have to remember these scripts.”</p><p>“You haven’t slept, you’ve been tortured, and you have to remember these scripts.”</p><p>Sara, a former scammer</p><p>“The worst part (was) you had to be sexual with them. You had to sext them,” she recounted.</p><p>For the models, there is real money to be made – though it could only be spent in the make-believe world of the scam compound and its malls, cinemas and hotels, according to Sara. Some models bought into it, doing their best to bring in large sums and make a cut themselves, she said.</p><p>A salary of up to $6,000 a month and a chance of a better life for loved ones back home made the risk worth taking for some. In what appear to be scammer and model audition tapes posted in Telegram channels, women from across Asia and Eastern Europe list their credentials. One says: “I have work experience as AI model for a year, dealing with US platform and also real face model dealing with Europe market. And also, I have basic knowledge in cryptocurrency and I’m a fast learner and I can work under pressure, and I hope you guys can give me a chance.”</p><p>CNN spoke with several women and their loved ones from countries in Central Asia and Eastern Europe who, at least initially, willingly entered the scam industry as models.</p><p>One of their employment contracts in Cambodia detailed the model’s job duties and the standards they are held to. It instructs them to “answer calls and videos according to customer needs, handle difficult questions, understand the customer’s chat history, and adjust emotions accordingly.” Models are also told to study “luxury goods, golf, rugby, luxury cars, and the lifestyles of the wealthy.”</p><p>Sara says as essential as women were to the operation, they were also the easiest to control through the constant threat of sex slavery.</p><p>“They would be like, ‘You want to go be a sex slave?’” she recalled. “They know that’s our greatest fear.”</p><p>After nine months, Sara was allowed to leave KK Park under the condition that she would return after caring for her sick mother. She didn’t.</p><p>Casie has been home since April but is still working out how to pay back huge debts her family accrued while she was trapped in Cambodia. “After that tragedy, after human trafficking happened, I really don’t know how to start again,” she said.</p><p>Lily finally returned home to the Philippines in November, to the boy in the Batman shirt and his little brother. Like Casie, she must put on a brave face and begin rebuilding a life for her young family. The children are relying on her.</p><p>Reporter: Teele Rebane</p><p>Correspondent: Hanako Montgomery</p><p>Field producer: Yasmin Coles</p><p>Editors: Sheena McKenzie, Hilary Whiteman</p><p>Cameraperson: Dan Hodge</p><p>Video editor: Exxon Ruebe</p><p>Senior video producer: Ladan Anoushfar</p><p>Visual editor: Carlotta Dotto</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>In Marseille, France’s most diverse city, a new wave of restaurants is redefining fine dining by blending haute cuisine with community solidarity.</p><p>Behind the ornate facade of Marseille restaurant Le République, lunch service is in full swing. Smoked mullet with sea fennel butter arrives as a starter, invoking the salty history of France's second city. Hay-smoked cheese with rice flour follows, singing with flavour from the surrounding Provençal countryside. Tourists and locals savour organic ingredients prepared by Michelin-starred chef Sébastien Richard.</p><p>But Le République is a gourmet restaurant with a few big differences. First, the staff include a recently released prisoner. Second, around 40% of diners will pay just €1 for their three-course feast. And, finally, several diners have never set foot inside a restaurant before.</p><p>Le République is a restaurant solidaire – one of around 10 in Marseille – run as a social enterprise in aid of community solidarity. Other examples include L'Après M, a former McDonald's taken over by its redundant staff when the franchise closed. The team purchased the premises and reopened it as a social enterprise, serving gourmet burgers created by a three-star Michelin chef served to the beat of Algerian rap, while operating a free food-delivery service of healthy takeout for people in need.</p><p>Marseille's newest restaurant solidaire is Chaleur, which opened in June 2025. When I visited, it was packed with patrons enjoying chilled cucumber soup adorned with clams, figs and roasted pumpkin seeds. A blowout lunch with wine costs around €25 (£21; $29). But if a patron explains that they're in a penurious position, they can enjoy the exact same menu for a tarif suspend – a \"suspended rate\" – of just €8 (£6.90; $9.29). Across Marseille, prices vary by philosophy. Some, like Le République, partner with charities to subsidise €1 meals, while others, like Chaleur, operate on trust.</p><p>Chaleur's popularity begs an obvious question: with food this tasty, why not make a profit?</p><p>\"Benevolence is a selfish way of saying that I want to be fulfilled in what I do,\" says Chaleur co-founder Raphaël Raynard. \"What enriches us is knowing our work is contributing to creating connections and helping people.\" The team regularly serves espressos to homeless neighbours and recently donated 300 meals to a workers' strike.</p><p>Chaleur's co-founder Nausicaa Roux believes Marseille's status as a \"lighthouse city\" is key to understanding the popularity of restaurants solidaires. Around 2,600 years of migration – including Greeks settlers in classical times to Iberian Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition and Armenians in the 20th Century – has made Marseille one of France's most diverse and religiously tolerant cities.</p><p>\"As a result, there's a real way of living together that I don't think exists in Paris or London,\" Roux said. \"Folks feel duty bound to help the one in five Marseillais who are born abroad. \"There is an openness not found in other cities in France.\"</p><p>These emigres didn't arrive empty handed. They carried ingredients like orange blossom water from the Middle East, which is used to make Marseille's iconic navette biscuits. Dates entered Europe via the Vieux Port, the city's ancient harbour, and probably tomatoes and bananas too. The dynamic city dialect includes words in Amazigh, Occitan and Italian, with phrases blending together like a linguistic bouillabaisse, the local fish stew made from imported saffron and regional seafood. Marseille is, quite literally, a global melting pot.</p><p>Thanks to Marseille's culinary history, food is Marseille's most powerful social tool. Few districts need it more than La Cabucelle, the city's former soap-making area, located high above the Vieux Port. Here, incomes hover around €975 (£849; $1131) per month – some €500 less than the Marseille average – and there's no youth centre or social space. That's why Léna Cardo opened her restaurant-daycare-social space Le Réfectoire, which started serving organic meals in April 2024.</p><p>Le Réfectoire's large, white-washed interior is a restaurant, library, nursery and information exchange rolled into one. \"Every Monday, we have a history teacher,\" says Cardo. \"She voluntarily gives up her time to teach French history to a dozen mums.\" Every Tuesday, a counsellor offers employment advice for free. \"We can be a place for a parent to learn French or a young adult to find a job.\"</p><p>However, what keeps customers coming back is Le Réfectoire's sublime food. Daily specials cost around €12, with recent offerings including a sea bream fillet on a bed of Provençal potatoes and tabbouleh topped with a goat's cheese galette. On Wednesdays, local chefs originally hailing from countries like Congo and Morocco take turns in the kitchen and share the revenue. Any excess profit is funnelled into local socio-cultural activities.</p><p>More like this:</p><p>• Is the future of French cheese at stake?</p><p>• Marseille: France's 'good natured' city</p><p>• The French Riviera's picture-perfect car-free island escape</p><p>Travellers are slowly discovering La Cabucelle, with its Moorish facades and Armenian churches. Everyday bar Monday, an epic Marché aux Puces (flea market) bustles with antiques, home clearance treasures and vintage Olympique de Marseille football jerseys. Cardo hopes they will book Le Réfectoire when they come. \"If you're buying something here,\" she says, \"you give money for activities to people who need them.\"</p><p>The walk from La Cabucelle to Marseille's rejuvenated docklands feels like a veritable world tour. E-scooters flit like barracudas through streets serving Tunisian lablabi soup and Comoran breadfruit crisps. An influencer could hook 1,000 followers with snapshots of Laotian spring rolls and staircases painted in colourful rainbows. In the docks themselves, ferries make nightly runs to Tangier, Tunis and Algiers, while container ships arrive from around the world.</p><p>Back at Le République, chefs are preparing evening starters like leek vinaigrette with a Parmesan biscuit and grated bottarga. Aside from serving €1 meals to diners in need of nutritious cuisine, the restaurant's central theme is \"insertion professionnelle\" – helping marginalised people back into work.</p><p>\"[We've employed] people with autism, single mothers who haven't been able to work for 20 years, people who can't read,\" says Sylvain Martin, who co-founded the restaurant with chef Sébastien Richard. \"We have had so many profiles that I can't list them all!\"</p><p>Some staff have come to Le République from Baumettes Prison, Marseille's toughest jail, where the last person in the Western world to be executed by guillotine took place in 1977. The prison is now home to Marseille's most curious restaurant solidaire, Les Beaux Mets, which translates as \"the beautiful dishes\" and is a play on the maximum security penitentiary's name. The fine-dining restaurant, open for lunch only, was created by the godfather of Marseille cuisine, Gérald Passedat (also the brains behind the L'Après M's gourmet burger) after learning that former offenders tended to return to crime in the absence of meaningful work.</p><p>\"Taking people from Baumettes is one of the hardest insertions we have,\" admits Martin. \"They say yes to anything until the judge is confident enough to release them.\" He says that some ex-prisoners fail to show up for work but the ones that apply themselves are \"very, very motivated\", having learnt teamwork and timekeeping skills behind bars. The prison confirmed that 75% of inmates who trained at the prison restaurant achieved employment or training upon release, thanks in large part to Le République.</p><p>The evening service at Le République ends with a turmeric-golden poached pear topped with tongue-numbing Sichuan pepper. There's an unspoken question at the caisse (counter): how can anyone enjoy a €1 dinner?</p><p>\"We have signed agreements with 100 charities who can book a meal at the price,\" explains Martin. All patrons receive their bill discreetly after dining together, ensuring dignity for those paying a reduced tariff.</p><p>And what if a diner games the system to bag a discount meal?</p><p>\"If you are selfish enough to cheat, then do it,\" says Martin. \"It's your problem every morning in front of the mirror.\"</p><p>--</p><p>If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.</p><p>For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Originating in Topkapi Palace where it delighted Ottoman sultans, this delicacy has a surprising ingredient.</p><p>'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.</p><p>The Braai tradition in South Africa is more than just a BBQ, it's a phenomenon that ties the nation together.</p><p>Mangal 2, a fixture on the London food scene, is redefining Turkish cuisine in a city constantly evolving.</p><p>AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.</p><p>Food writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.</p><p>At Michelin-starred Semma, chef Vijay Kumar brings deeply personal dishes from his childhood to the plate.</p><p>At Icca, Japanese sushi master chef Kazushige Suzuki blends ancient methods with other cuisines.</p><p>As part of its mission, Silo uses a nose to tail and root to tip approach to cooking out of respect for nature.</p><p>The menu at the Icehotel, the world's first hotel made out of ice and snow, is served on plates of ice.</p><p>How this one simple mistake gave birth to the 50-billion-dollar US chicken industry.</p><p>London's Darjeeling Express is ground zero for chef Asma Khan, a champion of women's empowerment.</p><p>Foraging is one of Finland's favourite hobbies and an essential part of the culture.</p><p>Floating in the middle of a Norwegian fjord, Restaurant Iris takes diners on an 'experiential dining' journey.</p><p>Deniseea Taylor is a mixologist who teaches what she jokingly calls 'drunk Black History'.</p><p>Taste of China: How chef Andrew Wong takes diners on a culinary journey across China's provinces.</p><p>Reel takes you to Italy to explore how the world's rarest and most expensive ingredient ends up on our tables.</p><p>What we eat, it turns out, can have an impact on how well our memory works.</p><p>American baker and chef Nancy Silverton explains the difference between British and American scones.</p><p>A huge recall of frozen fruits is currently happening across the US due to contamination fears.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>In three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive.</p><p>Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated.</p><p>The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the \"COP of truth\".</p><p>The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat</p><p>But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted.</p><p>And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting.</p><p>Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible.</p><p>So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP.</p><p>The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations.</p><p>Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that.</p><p>While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return.</p><p>Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas.</p><p>To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion.</p><p>It made matters worse.</p><p>Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy.</p><p>The EU were given short shrift by major producers.</p><p>\"We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,\" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer.</p><p>Ouch!</p><p>Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP.</p><p>These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain.</p><p>They are the richest group of nations still in the Paris Agreement but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour.</p><p>While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of.</p><p>The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft.</p><p>The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the \"tripling\" word stayed in the text.</p><p>So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in.</p><p>\"Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,\" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics.</p><p>\"This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union.\"</p><p>The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front.</p><p>The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself.</p><p>Two often heard positions:</p><p>How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words?</p><p>How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks?</p><p>The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore.</p><p>\"We can't discard it entirely,\" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News.</p><p>\"But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far.\"</p><p>Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people.</p><p>It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore.</p><p>Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an \"implementation cop\" and put a lot of focus on the \"energy agenda\". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant.</p><p>COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance.</p><p>For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an \"orchestrated\" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G.</p><p>'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking.</p><p>The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it.</p><p>They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - \"unilateral\" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive.</p><p>The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad.</p><p>If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves.</p><p>Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials.</p><p>The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization.</p><p>The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways.</p><p>US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here.</p><p>Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals.</p><p>And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels.</p><p>\"China kept a low political profile,\" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society.</p><p>\"And they focussed on making money in the real world.\"</p><p>\"Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position.\"</p><p>Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

{"details":"<p>Salehe Bembury is imagining what his career retrospective might look like. The lauded footwear designer, who is credited with spearheading Versace’s entry into the sneaker market, has no shortage of work to exhibit. From catwalk to high street, he’s designed for Yeezy, New Balance, Crocs, Puma, Moncler and more. However, he’s fantasizing about a “forbidden room” in the show; somewhere “you can see what I’ve worked on that no one’s known about.”</p><p>Yes, Bembury, despite his inimitable work, has ghost designed — and for big names too. He just can’t talk about it due to nondisclosure agreements. One day he might be able to spill the tea. But not today.</p><p>The 39-year-old designer confessed he forgot he’d mentioned this in his new book.</p><p>“Salehe: I Make Shoes” is the much-awaited art book telling the story of Bembury’s remarkable career to date. Combining interviews, essays, illustrations and candid photography, the book takes readers inside the niche and complex world of luxury sneakers. “I don’t think there are that many books that honor this space that we’re in — sneakers, hype culture,” he said.</p><p>“To any young designer that’s trying to figure out their path and trying to understand how to pivot or move or jump to the next gig, or deal with your uncertainty or your vulnerability — this book has that in there through my stories and through my experiences,” he added.</p><p>“This is a job of communication and millimeters.”</p><p>Salehe Bembury</p><p>Sneakers are a multibillion-dollar industry, though few designers are household names. The brand is generally king. Only a handful of exceptions have crossed into popular culture, Nike legend Tinker Hatfield chief among them. Bembury is heading that way.</p><p>Bembury came from the culture. As a kid in the ’90s, whether he was watching the NBA or “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,” he looked at what was on people’s feet. He grew up in New York, a few blocks from the bootleg vendors on Canal Street, though he cherished the real deal too much to buy knock offs. He was drawn to Nike — Jordan 11s, the Presto, the Air Footscape — and the narratives it built around new releases. But he wasn’t tribal; he could still appreciate a sneaker like the AND1 Too Chillin, which broke the mold and made him look at footwear differently.</p><p>Bembury knew early that he wanted to design sneakers. The dream was for Nike. His parents were artistic, but when it came to his future, they nudged him toward a practical middle ground. He majored in industrial design at Syracuse University — a decision that ended up being “extremely helpful,” he reflected, “because this is a job of communication and millimeters.”</p><p>Since then, he’s been on what he calls a “utilitarian quest.” “I’m not only looking to make things that look cool, they need to work,” he explained. “Because if it doesn’t work, it’s art.”</p><p>Bembury got his first break in 2011, when he was hired by the innovation team at Cole Haan, which was owned by Nike at the time. With a mandate to experiment, he played around creating hybrid concepts in a “Willy Wonka chocolate factory of creative expression,” he writes. From there he jumped to footwear startup Greats, where more of his designs were released. He began participating in marketing and cultivating a following of his own. Then in 2015 the artist formerly known as Kanye West (now Ye) came calling.</p><p>The designer decamped to the West Coast to join Ye’s team, where he created military-style boots for Yeezy’s third and fourth collections.</p><p>As a boss “(Ye) was an extremely motivated, inspired one,” he recalled. “My job there was to be his pencil, bring his ideas to fruition and try not to get in his way.”</p><p>“Getting to learn from him and be kind of like a voyeur in that space was extremely educational,” he added. The designer found himself floating in new, influential circles —with fashion-forward artists like 2 Chainz and designers like the late Virgil Abloh. “Yeezy was kind of the doorway,” he said.</p><p>“During this period, anyone that worked with Kanye was then knighted with some kind of Kanye dust. That allowed me to step into the high fashion space and be respected and be listened to.”</p><p>But after leaving Yeezy in 2016, Bembury hit a rough patch. He freelanced for a while. With funds running low, he fired out a series of pitches to people on LinkedIn. One of them was Dean Quinn, then-design director of Versace.</p><p>“I’ve kind of omitted this part of the story as of late because people get a little too caught up in it, but I was actually on the toilet when I sent the message,” Bembury confided.</p><p>Bembury argued Versace was missing out by not tapping into the sneaker market, and that the strength of the brand would translate. (Gucci, in comparison, had been making sneakers since the ’80s.) Three days later, he writes, Donatella Versace emailed him with an invite to Milan. In September 2017, Bembury began reporting directly to her as head of sneaker design.</p><p>His biggest hit at Versace was the Chain Reaction, which pulled from the fashion house’s iconography, including a chunky sole that looked like a thick gold chain. They became a fixture at gigs and catwalk shows — on the runway and in the front row.</p><p>Bembury, meanwhile, was carving out creative freedoms of his own. His contract with Versace allowed him to engage in a limited number of collaborations with other companies. He chose Chinese sportswear company ANTA and New Balance.</p><p>Even more of his personality was on display: bright, high-contrast colorways and elaborate, high-tech sole construction on the ANTA SB-01 and New Balance Yurt.</p><p>On the latter he famously added a whistle to the heel. “Truthfully, I came up with the whistle before I even came up with the why,” he said. But he says he’s regularly sent videos of trail runners trying it out in the woods. “The consumer doesn’t know what they want until you show it to them,” Bembury added — “shout out (to) Steve Jobs.”</p><p>By the time he left Versace in 2020 he was vice president of sneakers and men’s footwear. As a fully-fledged independent designer with a following, Bembury entered his mercenary era, hired to flip brands on their heads, make them cool and widen their audience.</p><p>Crocs was a prime example: In 2021 he created the Pollex Clog, a swooping, ribbed riff on the classic Crocs silhouette. It had Bembury’s fingerprints all over it — literally, as the 3D design was an amalgam of the designer’s own finger and thumbprints. He’d been toying with a fingerprint as his hallmark, and as the first collaborator Crocs had allowed him to design a shoe from scratch, which “seemed like the perfect opportunity,” he said.</p><p>It exploded. They were for adults and kids; Marc Jacobs and the man or woman on the street. Bembury said people would DM him saying, “‘You’re the reason I’m wearing Crocs for the first time.’” Crocs execs took note (he re-upped his deal with the brand in 2023).</p><p>“The Crocs moment was a pivotal one,” said Bembury. “I had been living in this very niche hype streetwear space, and this was something that was meant for everybody.”</p><p>Bembury had transcended the sneaker bubble and proved his designs could bring new consumers to a brand. Even more companies wanted a piece of him: Clarks, Vans, Moncler. He designed outerwear for Canada Goose and cover art for rapper Wiz Khalifa. He doubled down in the mainstream sneaker market with a significant partnership with Puma.</p><p>Still, he didn’t accept all offers. The Wall Street Journal reported Bembury was approached by Nike — his childhood dream — a few years ago and he turned them down, citing the terms of the deal. “While I’ll say that is a factual moment, I don’t really care to speak about it beyond that,” said Bembury, who was unhappy this tidbit had “taken over the dialog.”</p><p>Even those who couldn’t get him were looking to him for inspiration. “I don’t want to be   messy, but I had a designer from a company basically tell me that my work is the most seen stuff on their mood boards. That then helped me maybe confirm some speculation,” Bembury said.</p><p>Despite all evidence, the designer is uncomfortable with the idea he has clout. “I don’t know if there was a moment where I was like, ‘I’m the s—t,” he said. But he accepts he has “an audience,” one that he’ll need for his next venture — his own sneaker brand, Spunge, which launched in October.</p><p>“It’s time to execute everything I’ve learned.”</p><p>Salehe Bembury</p><p>The move is “long overdue,” he explained. “There are very few people within footwear that have been able to cultivate the audience that I have; had the success that I have. And it’s all under — was under, I guess — the title of a different brand. It makes complete sense that this person that has continuous success within a space to kind of venture out on their own.”</p><p>“It’s time to execute everything I’ve learned,” he added.</p><p>Spunge’s first model, Osmosis, retails for $150 and bridges sleek sports sneaker and rugged trail shoe, with colorways leaning toward the latter (Bembury is an outdoorsy guy). He says two more designs are “pretty much ready to go” and a third is in development.</p><p>The shift has been large for Bembury. The man who was once Ye’s pencil now has his own team to delegate ideas to — “initially a very uncomfortable experience” he admitted, but necessary to execute his vision.</p><p>“This is not a hype play. This is not a drop. This is not a moment,” Bembury said. “This is a forever brand. This is ownership.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>At this year's UN climate summit (COP30), under way in Brazil's Belem city, all eyes are on India - the world's third largest carbon emitter.</p><p>India has not yet submitted a key climate plan that countries are required to do every five years, even as international assessments have deemed India's climate action as being \"worryingly inadequate\". Delhi has argued otherwise.</p><p>Known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the updated plan from each member country to the UN Framework Climate Convention (UNFCC) is expected to have more ambitious carbon reduction targets as the world has failed to make the required level of cuts to avoid dangerous global warming.</p><p>So far, around 120 of the 196 member countries of the UNFCCC have submitted their updated plans and India is among the remaining ones.</p><p>The Paris climate agreement signed in 2015 has the goal of limiting average global temperature rise to well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C to avert drastic climate change.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says that by 2035, annual emissions will have to be reduced by 35% and 55%, compared with 2019, to align with the goals of the Paris agreement.</p><p>But emissions have continued to rise almost every year since then, and the climate plans submitted to the UNFCCC until 10 November show that there will be emissions reduction of only around 12% by 2035 – that too if countries fully implement their policies.</p><p>UNEP warns that current emission policies put the world on track for 2.8C of warming this century, underscoring the need for far more ambitious carbon-cutting targets.</p><p>The first deadline for the updated climate plan (NDC3) was February, but it was extended until September as more than 90% of member countries failed to meet it.</p><p>All eyes were on top emitters like China, India and the European Union, also because US President Donald Trump once again announced his country's exit from the Paris agreement, leaving the world wondering if other major emitters would offer to plug the gap.</p><p>But many countries missed the September deadline too. While some began to submit their plans before COP30, there were expectations that the remaining would do so during the climate meet in Belem.</p><p>Some have done so, but India kept the world guessing until environment minister Bhupender Yadav, who led the country's delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its plan only by the end of December.</p><p>So, why has India delayed submitting its climate plan, even though it could mean inviting negative press during COP30?</p><p>Though it has not explained its stance, Delhi appears keen to highlight a view shared by many developing nations: that rich countries bear historic responsibility to slash emissions and provide far greater financial support to the developing world.</p><p>A week before COP30 kicked off, Yadav wrote an opinion piece in the Economic Times newspaper where he argued that \"global climate progress can't come from endless discussions alone\".</p><p>\"For too long, the world has been caught in a cycle of negotiations, while the planet's distress signal grows louder. While dialogue is important, action is imperative,\" he wrote.</p><p>While delivering India's statement at COP30, Yadav seemed to expand on this argument.</p><p>\"Developed countries must reach net zero far earlier than current target dates and deliver new, additional and concessional climate finance at a scale of trillions, not billions,\" he said.</p><p>Indian officials, like many negotiators from the developing world, argue that their updated climate plans with more ambitious carbon reduction targets will mean nothing if they do not receive financial and technological support from developed countries.</p><p>The Paris climate agreement requires developed countries to provide financial support to the developing world, but it has remained a contentious issue.</p><p>The last COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, saw angry reactions from the developing world when developed countries said they would provide $300bn (£229bn) annually as climate finance by 2035, while poor countries were demanding more than $1tn.</p><p>Developing countries also say there has been no clarity and transparency on how the $300bn will be provided, and that developed countries are pushing for private finance which will burden poor countries with loans.</p><p>Meanwhile, some developed countries have argued that fast-emerging economies like China and India should also contribute to the global climate finance pot.</p><p>\"The best way to make sure that Europe can sustain that [the climate finance it has been providing] is by inviting others who have the ability to do so… to chip in,\" Wopke Hoekstra, climate commissioner at the European Commission, told a press conference at COP30.</p><p>Without naming any country, he said in many cases (such other countries) have far higher GDP per capita than a vast majority of European member states.</p><p>India says it shouldn't be pressed for a more ambitious climate plan as it has already met a key pledge - to have 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources - years ahead of the 2030 deadline.</p><p>Global assessments praise this but also flag other challenges.</p><p>Climate Action Tracker - an independent scientific project that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris agreement - has rated India's climate targets and actions as \"highly insufficient\".</p><p>It has pointed out that coal's share in India's total electricity generation continues to be around 75%, while it must drop to at least 19% to align the country's climate action with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C.</p><p>Another report released at COP30 has also underscored India's over-dependence on coal.</p><p>In the Climate Change Performance Index, published by environmental think-tank GermanWatch, India slipped 13 spots over the past year to rank 23rd on the list of 63 countries and the EU.</p><p>\"India's national pathway is still anchored in coal and there is no national coal exit timeline and new coal blocks continue to be auctioned,\" a report by the think-tank noted.</p><p>According to the recent UN emissions gap report, India saw the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year, followed by China and Indonesia.</p><p>But the world's largest carbon emitter China, usually India's ally at climate negotiations to counter developed countries, has already submitted its updated climate plan.</p><p>And now COP30 is also discussing whether there should be an announcement of a roadmap for the world to transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>It remains to be seen if criticism around India's dependence on coal will influence its updated climate plan, which it has committed to submit before this year ends.</p><p>England will face tournament debutants Italy at the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup while defending champions India and Pakistan will renew their rivalry in the group stage.</p><p>South Africa are on the brink of a first Test series win in India for 25 years after reducing the hosts to 27-2 in pursuit of 549 on day four in Guwahati.</p><p>Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.</p><p>India’s aviation regulator has asked airline operators to “strictly avoid\" volcanic ash affected areas.</p><p>More than 14,000 students on study visas sought asylum this year to June 2025 according to Home Office figures.</p><p>Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"details":"<p>EDITOR’S NOTE:  Examining clothes through the ages, Dress Codes investigates how the rules of fashion have influenced different cultural arenas — and your closet.</p><p>When you think of clothing silhouettes that evoke power and presence, 1980s-era padded shoulders might come to mind, the kind seen on Grace Jones when she wore a sharply tailored Giorgio Armani suit for her 1981 “Nightclubbing” album, or more recently, Doja Cat, whose exaggerated take at the 2025 Met Gala was designed by Marc Jacobs.</p><p>But long before power shoulders entered our lexicon, oversized sleeves were a status symbol at court in early modern Europe. They did much more than cut a striking figure — they were separate pieces that showed off one’s access to tailoring; used additional, expensive fabric as a flex during a period of luxury-limiting sumptuary laws; and represented one’s aptitude for the latest trends.</p><p>“The whole point of the style was to show off how much fabric you could possess,” said Darnell-Jamal Lisby, a curator at the Cleveland Museum of Art, who recently organized the exhibition “Renaissance to Runway: The Enduring Italian Houses,” which explores the historical connections between Italian Renaissance art and modern Italian fashion.</p><p>Today, billowing sleeves conjure romance and femininity, with detachable versions returning to bridal collections, while recent runways from Thom Browne, Louis Vuitton, Chloé, Valentino and Saint Laurent have all featured different takes on the shape. The actor Zoë Kravitz wore one of Saint Laurent’s off-the-shoulder voluminous sleeved gowns at the Academy Museum Gala in October, while Julia Fox donned a dramatic white puffed silhouette by Marc Jacobs at London’s amfAR Gala the same month.</p><p>These sleeves each point to different time periods when big sleeves reigned. In the 1830s and 1890s, to maximize size, they were often supported by soft padding from down pillows or structured with wiring for “lantern-like forms,” according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the 1930s, the fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli incorporated them into dinner suits and evening gowns, and the 1980s, they reemerged at proms and weddings with equally large hair. Sleeves have been a focal point of dress since humans began weaving clothes — the earliest known woven garment, the 5,000-year-old linen Tarkhan Dress, features pleating that embellishes the shoulders and arms.</p><p>But many periods of oversized, puffed-sleeve styles trace back to the Italian Renaissance, known for its sweeping artistic and cultural influence across Europe, when fashion began to rapidly speed up for the first time.</p><p>Dress Codes: Fashion’s most playful print has a fascinating history</p><p>In the early 16th century, sleeves that gave the illusion of bursting outwards were considered key to one’s it-factor, or “sprezzatura,” according to “Renaissance to Runway.”</p><p>Today, the term is more often associated with effortlessness and sophistication in menswear, but, at the time, was equally aspirational for both men and women.  Sprezzatura was a north star for court dressing and demeanor, a type of performative nonchalance that the elite could evoke and could — maybe — trickle down to the non-aristocratic classes as well, Lisby explained. It originated in Baldassare Castiglione’s popular “Book of the Courtier,” from 1528.</p><p>“When I think about television shows that are about making a pop star, whoever’s playing the manager in a show, will be like: ‘Well, you’ve got to be the pop star that the girls want to be and the guys want to have sex with. That’s basically what sprezzatura was,” Lisby said.</p><p>In art, he continued, “sleeves and hair are the best immediate way to tell not only where somebody’s from, but the time period that they’re living in.” In 16th-century Italy, wide barrel sleeves, sometimes layered or padded for effect, began to taper at the forearm, while the baragoni — the sleeve’s decorative upper part — transformed in shape, first resembling a cupcake, Lisby said, then narrowing to a doughnut. The colors of layered outer or under sleeves could signal one’s municipality — Milan was colorful, Florence subdued, he explained — or geopolitical alliances, with French-style sleeves influencing the north, and Spanish-style sleeves appearing further south. Italy’s aristocratic families, too, were “all canoodling with each other,” he added, cross-pollinating their sartorial influences.</p><p>It was a feature of dress that artists paid close attention to, as well, as traveling artworks became a primary vehicle for promoting fashion. A Lorenzo Lotto painting from the 1530s shows a man, possibly a high-ranking official, in a sumptuous doublet with padded velvet sleeves, arm outstretched. (In “Renaissance to Runway,” the portrait is paired with a fall 2022 runway shot of an oversized faux-fur ensemble by Diesel for its textures and shape.) Portraits by Raphael show the sprezzatura-imbued ease of early 1500s tie-on barrel sleeves, and, in 1518, the dramatic red hanging sleeves of the vicereine of Naples, Doña Isabel de Requesens y Enríquez de Cardona-Anglesola, when the region was under Spanish rule. One of the most stylish figures of the period, the duchess of Florence Eleonora di Toledo — who has notably been a reference point for designer Alessandro Michele, the exhibition notes — was famously painted by Bronzino, along with her son, in striking, highly embellished silk brocade.</p><p>“The sleeves are very telling — you can see where the pins are; you can see the emphasis on the more cupcake-style baragoni,” Lisby said. “She was ahead of the curve.”</p><p>These portraits have influenced style shifts for hundreds of years as later artists and designers looked back to the Italian Renaissance to revive it in fashion, art and architecture. Other bulbous sleeve crazes — including the 19th-century gigot revival in Victorian England — similarly translated prestige and might into sleeve size, as have contemporary designers when exaggerating silhouettes. With the sharper lines of suiting, bold shoulders eventually took over as a more modern signal of power — and a new way to take up space.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

{"details":"<p>Anna Wintour described the American philanthropist and former journalist Lauren Sánchez Bezos as a “great lover of costume and obviously of fashion” when asked about criticism surrounding the Bezos’s role as sponsors of the 2026 Met Gala.</p><p>Speaking to CNN in Doha, Qatar, at the inaugural Franca Fund Gala dedicated to the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, Wintour said she believed Sánchez Bezos would be a “wonderful asset to the museum and the event.”</p><p>“We’re very grateful for her incredible generosity,” Wintour told CNN, “so we’re thrilled she’s part of the night.”</p><p>Jeff Bezos and Sánchez Bezos’ were unveiled as lead sponsors of the event last week, along with secondary sponsors French luxury brand Saint Laurent and Vogue publisher Condé Nast.</p><p>Wintour relinquished her title as Vogue US’s editor-in-chief earlier this year, but remains Vogue’s global editorial director and chief content officer for Condé Nast, which means she still oversees the annual Met Gala.</p><p>The announcement of Bezos’s sponsorship drew immediate backlash on social media, with critics arguing that their involvement highlights a shift towards billionaire control of cultural institutions. Others have argued that the money could be better spent on other causes.</p><p>“Great theme,” wrote one user under a video on The Metropolitan museum’s official Instagram announcing that next year’s would be “Costume Art,” before adding: “However, stop platforming Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez with art and fashion, two places that these two awful, unfettered capitalists will never belong in, no matter how much money they want to throw around to buy culture they have never cultivated and will never inhabit.”</p><p>Met Museum unveils 2026 Met Gala theme: ‘Costume Art’</p><p>Traditionally, the gala and its accompanying exhibit have been supported by luxury houses, including this year’s event, which was backed by Louis Vuitton. However, past sponsors have also included big tech firms such as TikTok, Instagram (owned by Meta), Apple, Yahoo, and even Amazon. The latter sponsored the Met Gala in 2012 and Bezos, its founder, served as an honorary chair.</p><p>For some, the decision to sponsor the event is indicative of the couple’s ambition to gain cultural and fashion legitimacy, with parallels being drawn between Sánchez Bezos and Kim Kardashian’s rise within the fashion industry. It was only a decade ago that Kardashian — a friend of Sánchez Bezos — transformed her image from reality TV star to become a significant figure within high fashion circles, thanks in part to a nod of approval from Wintour and a Vogue cover with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, with whom she had a seven-year marriage.</p><p>While Sánchez Bezos has not publicly discussed her intentions, the move marks a deeper foray into the fashion world. The couple missed the 2025 Met Gala due to their wedding celebrations but attended the event in 2024 and posed for the cover of Vogue US in June this year. They were recently spotted at Paris Fashion Week, where they attended shows for Chanel and Balenciaga, wearing archival vintage looks curated by celebrity stylist Molly Dickson (whose clients also include the singer Lana del Rey and actor Sydney Sweeney). Sánchez Bezos’s Earth Fund also this year announced a $6.25 million partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to promote sustainability in fashion.</p><p>As part of their announcement, the Met also revealed that a gallery space would be named after the late founder of Condé Nast, in recognition of a donation (the amount of which was undisclosed) from the media company.</p><p>Amy Odell, the New York-based author of Wintour’s biography “Anna,” observed that the timing coincided with recent layoffs at the publisher, which impacted multiple titles including Teen Vogue — a decision that “people were very emotional about, because they cut the young, diverse voices who were doing political coverage for a young audience,” said Odell in an Instagram video. “Condé Nast is making cuts. The gala is going on. Rich people are ‘riching.’ The optics are kind of uncomfortable. Maybe these are just going to be the optics of the gala every year until something changes with income inequality in this country.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

{"details":"<p>Rose Dexter was just a month old in August when she developed constipation, gas and tummy discomfort, symptoms that her pediatrician chalked up to normal baby development.</p><p>“Looking back at the photos, she was losing weight. She looked sick,” said her dad, Stephen Dexter. “And the entire time during the decline, Mom had been saying something was wrong.”</p><p>That something turned out to be infant botulism, a condition caused by the spores of a bacteria that was growing in her gut, producing a toxin considered to be the most powerful in the world. It was poisoning her nerves and gradually paralyzing her.</p><p>Rose is one of at least 31 infants who have developed botulism after consuming powdered formula from the company ByHeart.</p><p>The California Department of Health conducted tests of an opened can of formula that had been fed to an infant, and those tests found Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that makes the toxin, spurring a nationwide recall of certain batches. Days later, the recall expanded to all ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans and Anywhere Pack products. Last week, an independent company hired by the manufacturer also found the bacteria in unopened cans of formula.</p><p>The number of illnesses in this outbreak may rise as officials reopen investigations into cases of infant botulism from earlier in the year.</p><p>Already, it is “certainly the largest foodborne illness outbreak that I’ve heard of in 32 years due to infant formula,” said attorney Bill Marler, who specializes in litigating food poisoning cases and is representing the Dexters and two other families in lawsuits against ByHeart. “This outbreak has me very worried.”</p><p>Dr. Steve Abrams, a neonatologist and expert on pediatric nutrition at the University of Texas at Austin, says he also doesn’t remember ever seeing this many patients sickened by baby formula.</p><p>“This is an insane level of patients, babies affected. I think you’d have to go back very far to find this many babies affected by a disease state from contaminated formula,” he said.</p><p>Despite growing numbers of illnesses, he’s worried that people aren’t aware of the recall or the severity of the outbreak.</p><p>“We have these disturbing reports of 10 days after the recall, people are going into stores and still find cans of ByHeart,” Abrams said last week. “This recall is testing some real untested waters that we haven’t seen before.”</p><p>ByHeart would not comment on pending litigation, but the company said in a statement that it is “doing everything we can to ensure this investigation reveals solutions and aids in understanding cases of infant botulism broadly. That’s what parents, the medical community, and you deserve.”</p><p>Although ByHeart said November 11 that it had recalled all its infant formula, the FDA said last week that it has received reports that some of the product is still on store shelves in multiple states, including at major chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger and Sprouts. It has also been sold through online marketplaces, including to some customers overseas.</p><p>“Consumers worldwide should not use any ByHeart brand infant formula as all ByHeart products are included in this recall,” the FDA said.</p><p>Marler said that it’s a retailer’s responsibility to remove recalled product from the shelves and that it’s not clear why the word hasn’t gotten out to all stores.</p><p>It’s also not clear how the formula – which is made with organic whole milk from grass-fed cows and advertises itself to health-conscious consumers as a “patented protein blend that’s as close to human breast milk as possible” – became contaminated.</p><p>ByHeart said Wednesday that it is working with the FDA to examine “every facet of our process – from ingredient-sourcing to our manufacturing process and facilities, packaging, transportation, everything.”</p><p>Botulinum is a unique problem in food poisoning. Adults get sick from ingesting the toxin that’s made by the bacteria, often by eating improperly canned food. Babies, whose guts aren’t yet fully developed, fall ill after ingesting the spores of the bacteria, which then colonize their guts and begin producing the toxin.</p><p>“If you think about seeds, like plant seeds, spores are like the same version, only produced by bacteria,” said Dr. Kristin Schill, a food microbiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Food Research Institute. “They package their DNA and kind of like a protein shell, like a seed, that prevents them from being killed in harsh environments.”</p><p>Spores can survive pasteurization, the heat treatment that destroys other types of pathogens in milk.</p><p>ByHeart formula uses whole milk powder as an ingredient, as well as whey and other dairy ingredients.</p><p>“Any of those ingredients really could be a source of spores. There could be an accumulation of spores on the equipment, I don’t know,” said Schill, who previously worked as a research microbiologist for the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Schill said botulinum spores have been found in milk powder in the past, though at very low concentrations. A case of infant botulism linked to powdered infant formula was published in a medical journal in 2005.</p><p>It will be critical to find out how high the concentrations of spores are in the formula that’s been tested, Schill said, and those levels may help point investigators in the right direction.</p><p>Stephen Dexter said he bought the first can of ByHeart formula for Rose after they got home from the hospital and his wife, Yurany, had trouble making enough breast milk.</p><p>“It was kind of a desperate move,” he said. He wasn’t sure what to get and went to a natural grocery chain, “assuming they would have some alternative selections.”</p><p>He looked for the most expensive formula, figuring that would be higher quality. ByHeart sells for about $40 a can. “It said all the things I was looking for. It said all the things that I thought I would not want, as it had a bunch of ‘no’s’ on there, which seemed good to me, and so I purchased that,” he said.</p><p>Rose did well on the formula, Dexter said, until she didn’t.</p><p>After a few weeks of subtle changes, he tried to wake Rose one day for a normal feeding, but she wouldn’t wake up. It was “the moment of ‘Oh, we gotta go.’ … That’s when we took her to the to the emergency room.”</p><p>“She couldn’t move her arms or her legs,” Yurany Dexter said. The doctors tried to gently lift Rose’s head and shoulders to see whether she could hold them up, and she couldn’t.</p><p>They did blood tests and then used a needle to collect the clear fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain. Doctors told the baby’s parents that they suspected muscular dystrophy or botulism.</p><p>Infant botulism “happens a little bit from the top of your head down. So you first might notice droopy eyelids or some parents notice, like, their infant’s expressions are not as expressive,” said Dr. Erica Pan, a pediatrician who is the state public health officer with the California Department of Health. “It’s a slow progression.”</p><p>That makes the early symptoms hard to spot. Each year in the United States, fewer than 200 infants develop this type of botulism, and as long as they are diagnosed in time — the condition can be fatal if it paralyzes their lungs — the cases all eventually come to the California Department of Public Health, which has an Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program.</p><p>The program is the legacy of Dr. Stephen Arnon, chief of the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program at the California health department, who dedicated his life to finding a treatment for infantile botulism.</p><p>That treatment is called BabyBIG, for botulism immune globulin. It’s made from the plasma – the clear part of the blood – of donors who’ve been vaccinated against botulism. It’s the only treatment available in the world for the condition.</p><p>It’s also an orphan drug, meaning it’s not profitable for pharmaceutical companies to make. The process is expensive and there’s not a large market for it. So the California Department of Public Health makes it.</p><p>It’s still very expensive, costing nearly $70,000 per treatment. But it’s so effective that it cuts the time a baby may have to spend in the hospital by an average of three and a half weeks, meaning it easily saves more money than it costs.</p><p>The California health department says it has treated nearly 2,200 infants with BabyBIG since it was approved by the FDA in 2003. From August 1 through November 19, it said 107 infants nationwide have received BabyBIG treatment.</p><p>The doctors gave Rose a dose of BabyBIG partly on faith: They didn’t have confirmation that she had botulism when they treated her. But soon after she got it, her condition began to improve. Stool testing finally confirmed botulism just a few weeks ago.</p><p>The California infant botulism program does a thorough case investigation for each patient. They ask about exposure to dust or honey, which can be another source of the spores. They also ask about what formula the child uses.</p><p>“Often, we just don’t find a source,” Pan said.</p><p>Starting in August, Pan said, the agency began to get more calls than usual to the infant botulism hotline. In taking the case histories, they learned that about half the babies were formula-fed, and about half of those had consumed ByHeart.  That was a red flag since ByHeart accounts for only about 1% of all formula sales nationwide.</p><p>“It’s a much, much higher proportion than you would expect, and that’s what raised the alert,” she added.</p><p>The state contacted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to its findings and issued a nationwide alert November 8, when just two specific lots of the formula were recalled.</p><p>The Dexters had no idea that the formula they were feeding their daughter might have been the source of her illness. They continued to give it to her even after she got home from the hospital.</p><p>Then they got a call asking whether they’d fed Rose from either of two specific lots of the ByHeart formula. Stephen, who repairs pianos for a living, had kept all the cans to store the parts he uses. “None of my numbers match the recalled numbers,” he said, but they stopped giving the formula to Rose. Additional products were recalled on November 11.</p><p>After weeks of panic and worry about their daughter, they were relieved she was back home and getting better. But the recall has stirred all those emotions up again.</p><p>“I feel like it was a nightmare, all the things that happened for us,” said Yurany, who still regrets that she wasn’t able to breastfeed.</p><p>“You just keep getting more and more angry, just kind of reflecting and going, how did this happen?” Stephen said.</p><p>Rose is recovering. She continues to see a gastroenterologist every few months to make sure her gut is healing.</p><p>For now, investigators are racing to find the exact cause of the infections before more babies get sick.</p><p>“I hope we can find the source of the outbreak to prevent future infant botulism outbreaks,” Schill said. “It is heartbreaking that such a vulnerable population can be subjected to a horrible disease.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk said her organization’s efforts to support a potential JD Vance presidential campaign in 2028 are “in the works.”</p><p>Kirk’s comments on an episode of The Megyn Kelly Show that was released on Monday were not unexpected.</p><p>Her late husband, Charlie Kirk, was an early advocate of Vance during Donald Trump’s vice presidential selection process in 2024, and the two remained close friends until Kirk’s assassination in Utah in September.</p><p>But the promise of the group’s backing is a critical acquisition for Vance’s hypothetical future presidential campaign. While Vance remains the most obvious apparent heir to Trump’s MAGA movement, other prominent Republicans have been making subtle moves to position themselves as candidates in 2028.</p><p>Turning Point, which Charlie Kirk co-founded in 2012 and ran until his death, has transformed into one of the most influential organizations in MAGA politics and has been credited with helping to galvanize young people to support Trump in the 2024 election. Erika Kirk took over the organization and vowed to keep it going in her husband’s memory shortly after he was killed.</p><p>Erika Kirk told Kelly that one of the last conversations she had with her husband was about “how intentional he was about supporting JD for ’28.”</p><p>But she emphasized the organization’s first priority is the midterm elections next year.</p><p>“Let’s start with the midterms before we start jumping to ’28,” she said. “And let’s enjoy the fact that we do have Donald Trump in office, and we worked really hard to make that happen, my husband did.”</p><p>“So I just want to enjoy that for a minute before we start jumping ahead,” she added.</p><p>In August, Trump acknowledged that Vance is “most likely” the heir of his MAGA movement. But then he quickly also name checked Secretary of State Marco Rubio and mused that Vance and Rubio could appear together on a future, hypothetical ticket.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>President Donald Trump has leaned into his clemency powers during his second term, dishing out pardons to more than 1,000 January 6 US Capitol rioters, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, baseball legend Darryl Strawberry, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani — and now: Gobble and Waddle.</p><p>Justice will be served at the White House on Tuesday as Trump pardons a pair of turkeys for fowl reasons, participating in the 78th annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation.</p><p>The president will make much ado about stuffing and appeal to his baste at the Thanksgiving roast, a yearly opportunity for a cornucopia of puns and a moment to give thanks — providing some levity amid a range of global crises and plenty of political upheaval.</p><p>Unlike previous years, just one turkey will take part in the ceremonial pardon, injecting little suspense into the process. (Both turkeys, according to the office of the first lady, will ultimately be spared.) First lady Melania Trump’s office invited the American people to vote for which turkey would participate by texting “Gobble” or “Waddle” to 45470.</p><p>Hatched last July in North Carolina, Gobble and Waddle weigh in at 52 and 50 pounds, respectively, and rode the gravy train to Washington. They spent their young lives training for their pardon, getting acclimated to loud sounds, big crowds and bright lights ahead of a luxe stay in a suite at the nearby Willard InterContinental Hotel.</p><p>Following Tuesday’s festivities, the birds will retreat to North Carolina State University’s Prestage Department of Poultry Science in Raleigh to live out a relieved retirement.</p><p>White House holiday festivities get underway despite ballroom construction</p><p>Rumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as Abraham Lincoln’s administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln’s young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>A competitive version of the ceremony became national news in 1920, when a turkey from Texas sent to Woodrow Wilson in a White House-shaped crate battled outside the People’s House with a turkey from Kentucky. The Kentucky bird emerged victorious, according to the White House Historical Association.</p><p>The National Turkey Federation became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947, and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since Harry Truman’s tenure. Truman had asked Americans to observe poultry-less Thursdays to support rationing in Europe after World War II, according to the National Archives. The policy wasn’t very popular, and the federation presented Truman with a live turkey as a sign of protest, kicking off the annual tradition. While Truman was the first to accept a turkey from the group, he did not offer it a pardon.</p><p>The first documented turkey pardon was given by John F. Kennedy in 1963, though it didn’t catch on right away. Even though Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, neither decided to pardon any turkeys as president.</p><p>Turkey pardoning became the norm in 1989, when George H.W. Bush revived the tradition, now a staple of the White House holiday season.</p><p>This will mark Trump’s fifth turkey pardon, and, like his recent predecessors, he has peppered the event with topical political jokes.</p><p>Trump poked fun at the impeachment inquiry against him in 2019, telling a crowd that the turkeys “have already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff’s basement,” referring to the California Democrat, then a congressman.</p><p>Former President Joe Biden nodded to the 2022 midterm election dynamics when he pardoned Chocolate and Chip: “The votes are in, they’ve been counted and verified, no ballot stuffing, no fowl play. The only red wave this season is going to be if German shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce.”</p><p>And Barack Obama employed his signature rhetoric in 2016: “I want to take a moment to recognize the great turkeys who weren’t so lucky, who didn’t get to ride the gravy train to freedom. Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren’t chicken.”</p><p>“Yes, we cran,” Obama added.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

This will feel like quite a shock compared to last week when many of these areas saw highs pushing into the 70s and 80s.</p><p>This cold plunge is just an appetizer for some parts of the country.  A strong push of Arctic air is expected to arrive in the central US Thanksgiving weekend into early next week. That will bring another round of below-average temperatures to the Rockies, Plains and parts of the Midwest to end November and start December. Low temperatures might plunge below zero in parts of Montana and North Dakota by Sunday or Monday Morning.</p><p>New York City will see temperatures drop into the 40s late Wednesday with gusty northwest winds sticking around through Thanksgiving and Black Friday.</p><p>Blustery conditions will make crowds shiver at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, where wind chill temperatures will stay in the 30s. Gusts could reach 20 to 30 mph at times. That’s below the threshold for grounding the big character balloons, but handlers may need to keep a tighter grip.</p><p>At least the weather should stay dry with peeks of sun for the crowds lining the parade route.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.</p><p>In June, dozens of biodegradable pods fell from the sky over the forests of Hawaii. Each one, delivered by drone, contained about 1,000 mosquitoes.</p><p>These weren’t just any mosquitoes — they were non-biting, lab-reared male mosquitoes carrying a common bacterium that results in eggs that don’t hatch when the males mate with wild females. The hope is that they will help to control the archipelago’s invasive mosquito population, which is decimating native bird populations, such as rare Hawaiian honeycreepers.</p><p>The birds, which are key pollinators and seed dispersers and also play a central role in Hawaiian culture, are in dire straits. There were once more than 50 known species of honeycreepers in Hawaii, but today there are only 17 left, most of which are endangered.</p><p>Last year, the ‘akikiki, a small gray bird, went functionally extinct in the wild, and less than 100 of the yellow-green ʻakekeʻe are estimated to remain.</p><p>Development and deforestation have had an impact, but according to Dr. Chris Farmer, Hawaii program director for the American Bird Conservancy (ABC), the “existential threat” is avian malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes.</p><p>The insects are not native to Hawaii, but were first reported in 1826, likely unintentionally carried over by whaling vessels. “They caused waves of extinction,” says Farmer, as many native birds, such as the honeycreepers, had no resistance to the disease.</p><p>Since mosquitoes thrive in the warmer tropical habitats in the low elevations of Hawaii’s islands, the remaining honeycreepers found a refuge higher up in the mountains of islands such as Maui and Kauai, he explains.</p><p>Now, this is changing. “With climate change, we are seeing warmer temperatures and we’re watching the mosquitoes move up the mountains,” he says. “(In places like Kauai) we’re watching the populations of birds there just completely plummet.”</p><p>“It’s a constant march of mosquitoes moving up as the temperatures allow them and the birds getting pushed further and further up until there’s no habitat left that they can survive in.</p><p>“If we don’t break that cycle, we’re going to lose our honeycreepers,” he adds.</p><p>Conservationists have been searching for a solution to control mosquito populations and provide a lifeline to the honeycreepers. But dealing with mosquitoes on a landscape scale is difficult, says Farmer, who explains that the use of pesticides, for instance, would also damage native insect populations such as damselflies and fruit flies that are vital to ecosystems.</p><p>Because mosquitoes are also such a huge threat to human health, spreading human malaria, dengue fever and the zika virus, among others, scientists have been studying the problem for decades, coming up with various solutions, including the incompatible insect technique (IIT).</p><p>This involves releasing male mosquitoes that have a strain of naturally occurring bacteria called Wolbachia, which causes non-viable eggs when they mate with wild females. Over time, with repeated releases, the wild population should decline as a result.</p><p>Related article\n      The world’s smallest elephants are facing extinction. One woman has a plan to save them</p><p>In 2016, ABC, together with Birds, Not Mosquitoes, a multi-agency partnership dedicated to protecting Hawaiian honeycreepers, decided IIT had the best chance of succeeding in Hawaii and started to investigate how to apply the same technique to mosquitoes transmitting avian malaria.</p><p>“The mosquito that transmits avian malaria is different from the one that transmits human malaria,” explains Farmer, so they began testing various strains of Wolbachia within the southern house mosquitoes found in Hawaii to determine which one was most effective.</p><p>The process took several years, due to “a combination of the science, community engagement and the regulatory process,” says Farmer, adding that, naturally, “whenever you say, ‘I want to release millions of mosquitoes in the forest,’ people have a lot of very legitimate questions.”</p><p>In 2022 they started ramping up production, rearing millions of mosquitoes with the chosen Wolbachia strain in a laboratory in California. The following year, they started releasing the insects in areas where the honeycreepers live in Maui, dropping them in biodegradable pods from helicopters.</p><p>“We have a rough estimate for how many mosquitoes there are in the wild, and we try to release 10 times as many of these Wolbachia mosquitoes, so (that they) find these females and are able to mate with them, and then their eggs don’t hatch,” says Farmer.</p><p>“Right now, we’re releasing 500,000 mosquitoes a week on Maui and 500,000 mosquitoes a week on Kauai,” he adds, using both drones and helicopters.</p><p>According to Farmer, it’s the first example globally of IIT being used for conservation purposes. If successful, he hopes it will inspire uses elsewhere. He warns, however, that while in Hawaii they felt confident using the technique because mosquitoes are an invasive species that have only been around for 200 years and therefore play no major ecological role, in other countries where they are native, the technique could have unintended repercussions to the ecosystem.</p><p>One of the major barriers to releasing the insects in Hawaii has been the remote, mountainous terrain, prone to strong winds and unpredictable weather. The program has had to rely mainly on helicopters for releases, but these are expensive to run and there are a limited number on the archipelago, with competing needs for firefighting, safety and tourism, says Farmer. Often, missions have had to be called off last minute due to weather, he adds.</p><p>This is where drones come in. After months of testing the aerial vehicles in demanding conditions, checking their range, and designing protective, temperature-controlled parcels that can safely carry mosquitoes and be fixed onto the body, they successfully started deploying mosquitoes by drone in June.</p><p>It is the “first known instance of specialized mosquito pods being dropped by drones,” says Adam Knox, project manager for ABC’s aerial deployment of mosquitoes. “We have more flexibility with deployment timing in areas that generally have very unpredictable weather and it’s safer because no humans need to ride in the aircraft to deploy the mosquitoes.”</p><p>It also “reduces costs, team flight times, emissions and noise, which in turn means cheaper, more sustainable deployments,” he adds.</p><p>Farmer expects it to be a year or so before they will see the results of the deployments and whether the IIT technique is working. However, he is hopeful that it will help “buy time” for the birds to recover.</p><p>A study from San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute found there is still time to save honeycreepers like the ʻakekeʻe from extinction if IIT mosquito control efforts are successful.</p><p>Christopher Kyriazis, postdoctoral researcher from San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and lead author of the report, told CNN that their modeling demonstrated the urgency of the situation: “If you wait even a couple years, the window narrows really quickly.”</p><p>While IIT is “ambitious” and has never been used on this scale for these sorts of conservation aims before, he believes “there is hope for the species, if it can be effective.”</p><p>If mosquito populations were under control, there is the possibility that the honeycreepers would have time to replenish populations and with more genetic diversity, and may even develop their own resistance to avian malaria. There are already signs of that happening with one honeycreeper species, the ‘amakihi, on Hawaii Island, says Farmer.</p><p>Related article\n      The fish collectors hoping to save rare species from extinction</p><p>However, Kyriazis cautions that “even if a (protective) mutation did arise at this point, for it to be able to spread through the population fast enough to save it is very unlikely.”</p><p>A safer environment would also give the opportunity to reintroduce captive populations of birds like the ‘akikiki; although it is extinct in the wild, some are being bred at bird conservation centers in Hawaii.</p><p>For Farmer, being at the forefront of this effort and seeing birds go extinct is “soul shattering.” But it also drives him.</p><p>“We have the ability to save these species,” he says. “If we don’t save these birds in this decade, then they probably won’t be here for the future. And so the ability to make a difference in the world, make a difference in the future, motivates us all.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.</p><p>Deep within Nelson Lakes National Park, in New Zealand’s South Island, lies a magical blue-violet lake. Surrounded by steep alpine forests and spring-fed from the glacial waters of Lake Constance, it is small but not insignificant.</p><p>It was first discovered by Ngāti Apa, a Māori iwi, or tribe, who named it Rotomairewhenua, meaning “the lake of peaceful lands.” It became a sacred place where they cleansed the bones of the dead, believing this would secure the spirit a safe journey to the ancestral Māori homeland of Hawaiki.</p><p>In more recent history, hikers passing through the national park have commented on the lake’s extraordinary color and ethereal energy, but it was only around a decade ago that scientists discovered that the water of the sub-alpine lake had “exceptional optical purity” with a visibility of between 70 and 80 meters. That’s in line with that of pure water, which they said made it “the most visually clear freshwater yet reported.”</p><p>The title of “clearest lake in the world” and photos of the stunning landscape have since been shared widely on social media, making the lake a popular tourist destination between December and March (during New Zealand’s summer). But conservationists and the Ngāti Apa now fear that this increased popularity could threaten the purity of the lake.</p><p>Their biggest concern is the spread of lindavia, a microscopic alga known colloquially as “lake snow” or “lake snot” for the slime it creates that hangs just below the surface of the water. The alga is already present downstream of Rotomairewhenua (also known as Blue Lake) in lakes Rotoiti, Rotoroa and Tennyson, and is at risk of being carried up the trail on hikers’ boots or in their water bottles.</p><p>An invasive species to New Zealand, lindavia most likely made its way there from North America, possibly via fishing gear, speculates Phil Novis, a senior research scientist specializing in algae at the government-owned environmental institute Landcare Research. The first records of it in the country are in the early 2000s and since then it has spread fairly widely. “Humans are the main vector,” he says, explaining that in previous research his team collected and tested sediment cores from 380 lakes in New Zealand, and the only ones with lindavia present were those easily accessible to humans.</p><p>Just one small speck of it could change the ecology of a lake forever, he adds, and it can be carried fairly easily in water droplets. He recalls one instance when he found a sample of lindavia on the chest hair of a man who had swum a couple of kilometers through Lake Wānaka, in the Otago region of New Zealand.</p><p>While it is not known to be toxic for humans, the alga excretes long viscous strands known as mucilage that when concentrated can become a nuisance – known to clog up fishing lines, boat filters or hydroelectric power systems. In the case of Rotomairewhenua, the film of slime it creates could obscure the lake’s exceptional clarity.</p><p>“We are deeply concerned,” says Jen Skilton, ecologist and Taiao advisor (environmental manager) for Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō Trust, a non-profit organization that supports the iwi. “If this invasive microorganism enters the lake, it has the potential to have far-reaching consequences, affecting the water quality and overall health of the lake.”</p><p>She adds that this would be devastating for the Ngāti Apa, for whom Rotomairewhenua holds immense cultural and spiritual significance. While they no longer use the lake for ancient rituals, it is a part of their identity, she says: “We maintain a living connection to our ancestral traditions and ensure that Rotomairewhenua is preserved for future generations.”</p><p>Since 2013, when the research on the lake’s clarity was published, visitor numbers have more than doubled, according to New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, which collects voluntary data provided by hikers at the visitors’ hut near Rotomairewhenua. Most people trek to the lake via two or seven-day circuits, or as part of the Te Araroa long distance trail, which spans the entire length of New Zealand.</p><p>Related article\n      A New Zealand mountain has been granted personhood. Here’s why that matters</p><p>The title of “clearest lake in the world” and the resulting social media buzz has definitely contributed to its popularity, says Melissa Griffin, senior biodiversity ranger for Nelson Lakes at the Department of Conservation. “Before then it was a beautiful place that was known, but not many people went there. Then when it got the title, that really started to increase the amount of trampers (hikers) that were going to the lake.”</p><p>As a result, the Department of Conservation, Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō Trust and Te Araroa Trust, have been working together to introduce biosecurity measures along the route. They have installed cleaning stations beside the lakes where lindavia is present, with educational signs requesting that hikers clean their shoes and gear before traveling on towards Rotomairewhenua, and potentially taking new species with them.</p><p>Most of all, through signs and videos broadcast on the Te Araroa trail app, they are urging visitors not to touch the water – be it swimming, wetting a towel to cool down, or dipping in a GoPro to get an underwater shot. This is not only due to the biosecurity risk but also out of respect for the place: “The water of Rotomairewhenua is ‘tapu’ (sacred) and entering the water is a violation of that,” says Skilton.</p><p>During the summer, a warden – often someone from the Department of Conservation or a Ngāti Apa representative – stays for an extended period at the lake to watch over and talk to hikers, explaining the biosecurity risks, the lake’s cultural significance, and potential human impact.</p><p>So far, there are signs that people are respecting the guidance, and fewer examples of visitors recklessly dipping themselves or a towel in the water after a long and sweaty hike. But surveys show there is still a gap between understanding the risk and being proactive about averting it. Janet Newell, biodiversity ranger for the Department of Conservation, says that while people acknowledge they have read the signs at cleaning stations and understand why they are there, that doesn’t necessarily translate into them using them. There’s a belief that “it’s not me that’s the problem, it’s other people,” she says.</p><p>As Rotomairewhenua is part of a national park, restricting visitor numbers would be difficult, and it’s not a measure the Department of Conservation wants to take. Instead, the message it wants to get out is for people to go and enjoy these pristine environments but consider the wider impact that they are having.</p><p>Related article\n      Light pollution is getting worse, but there is a movement to make our skies dark again</p><p>When working as a hut warden, Griffin’s role included picking up rubbish and cleaning the toilets. “The increase in numbers has meant that the number of times we need to empty those toilets is increasing,” she says. “So then you have costs of helicopters, the carbon of getting a helicopter into the backcountry: these are all things to consider when you think about the number of people that are going into the backcountry.”</p><p>But at the same time, “You want people to go and enjoy and be able to see it, and sit there and sit with it,” she says, recalling her first visits. “There’s something really special about getting there, standing next to the lake, and it’s just peaceful. You hear lots of birds, but the water is peaceful, and seeing into it is crazy, it’s so stunning.”</p><p>In the end it comes down to a fine balance, says Skilton: “The growing number of visitors brings both opportunity and responsibility. It is crucial that all who visit understand the significance of this place and take the necessary steps to minimize their impact.</p><p>“By adhering to the rules and guidelines, we can protect the lake’s unique ecological features and safeguard its cultural importance for future generations.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

But don’t be fooled, this small marsupial is not as adorable as it looks. When threatened by a predator, the bettong will eject its tiny joey from its pouch and bounce off in a different direction to evade capture.</p><p>Sacrificing one’s own young might seem brutal, but it’s an essential survival strategy for a species that, until recently, was extinct in South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula.</p><p>Brush-tailed bettongs (also known as woylies) once inhabited more than 60% of mainland Australia. However, the European colonization of the country brought with it predatory feral cats and foxes, and the destruction of much of the animal’s native grassland and woodland habitats.</p><p>Between 1999 and 2010, the species’ population size declined by 90% – a drastic drop that some research suggests may have resulted from the spread of blood parasites, alongside other factors. Today, the brush-tailed bettong is limited to just a few islands and isolated mainland pockets in Southwestern Australia: a mere 1% of its former range.</p><p>“We are on a mission, if you like, to bring back some of these native species that have gone missing in our landscape since European colonization,” says Derek Sandow, project manager of Marna Banggara, an initiative dedicated to restoring some of the Yorke Peninsula’s historic ecological diversity.</p><p>Formerly known as the “Great Southern Ark,” the project, which was launched in 2019 by the Northern and Yorke Landscape Board, was renamed to honor the region’s native Narungga people, who are heavily involved with the initiative.</p><p>“Marna in our language means good, prosperous, healthy, and Banggara means country,” says Garry Goldsmith, a member of the Narungga community who works on the project.</p><p>The team initially erected a 25-kilometer predator-control fence across the narrow part of the Yorke Peninsula to create a 150,000-hectare safe haven for the first species to be brought back: the brush-tailed bettong, known as yalgiri to the Narungga people. “We’ve reduced fox and cat impacts to a level that’s low enough for these yalgiri to be reintroduced and for them to actually find refuges, find food, and to survive themselves,” says Sandow.</p><p>Related article\n      Rare species discovered deep within Cambodian mountains</p><p>Between 2021 and 2023, the team introduced almost 200 brush-tailed bettongs to the protected area. Sourcing these individuals from various remaining populations across Western Australia helped to “increase the genetic pool,” says Goldsmith.</p><p>Sandow adds that boosting species diversity is important as these individuals “hold the genetic footprint for the future of the species here.”</p><p>Brush-tailed bettongs feed on bulbs, seeds and insects, but their primary food source is fungi growing underground; to find it, they must dig. “They’re nature’s little gardeners,” says Sandow, “a single yalgiri can turn over two to six tons of soil per year.”</p><p>That’s why they’re the first species being reintroduced to the region, he says. All this digging aerates the soil, improves water filtration and helps seedlings germinate – benefitting other animals that rely on the ecosystem.</p><p>So far, the reintroduction program is “probably even exceeding expectations,” says Sandow. Almost 40% of the individuals captured in a recent monitoring survey were descendants of those originally introduced to the area and 22 of the 26 females were carrying pouch young. This means that “they’re breeding and healthy,” he says.</p><p>“The really important part of this is to learn from the process,” says Goldsmith. If all goes to plan, the team hopes to return more locally extinct species to the region over the next few years, including other marsupials like the southern brown bandicoot, red-tailed phascogale and western quoll.</p><p>Sandow insists that improving the region’s ecosystem through species reintroductions and predator control can also have positive knock-on effects on industries such as tourism. “It can benefit local businesses, it can benefit local agriculture, it can provide those conservation benefits,” he says. “It doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive.”</p><p>Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

{"details":"<p>UCL</p><p>Champions</p><p>League Drama</p><p>Photos: Getty Images; design: Demetrius Robinson</p><p>Andres Iniesta’s first night at Barcelona’s renowned La Masia youth academy was one of the worst of his life.</p><p>Aged just 12, and having spent his whole upbringing until then surrounded by family in his small village of Fuentealbilla (population 2,400, in the southern Spanish province of Albacete), he was now alone, hundreds of miles from home.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>He was fulfilling a dream, but the experience left a mark on him. Iniesta says the “traumatic” change “took its toll” and he believes it may have played a role in the depression he would later suffer at the peak of his career, even if “things returned to normal”.</p><p>Now aged 41, the former Barcelona and Spain midfielder retired from football in October last year. He still uses the present tense when he talks about the game, though — perhaps because you never stop being a footballer, or perhaps because he has not yet fully come to terms with not setting foot on the pitch in an official match ever again.</p><p>“I think I will feel that nostalgia my whole life,” he says in an exclusive interview with The Athletic. “I do miss it. The thing is, you come to realise that football is not just those 90 minutes (of a game), but that it requires a lot of preparation. In the end, that is what wears you out.”</p><p>This autumn marks the first anniversary of Iniesta’s new life — and it seems as if the club of his career, Barcelona, are paying tribute to him with some of their Champions League trips this season.</p><p>Earlier this month, they played out a madcap 3-3 draw at Club Brugge’s Jan Breydel Stadium — the ground where, in 2002, Iniesta made his senior debut aged 18.</p><p>Today (Tuesday), they visit Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge, where the midfielder scored one of the most important goals of his career, and in Barca’s history, to take them to the 2009 Champions League final. There, a side then managed by Pep Guardiola would complete the treble for the first time.</p><p>Iniesta is most associated with Guardiola’s Barcelona and his longtime midfield partners in that team, Xavi and Sergio Busquets. He won everything there is to win at club and international level — including nine La Liga titles, six Copas del Rey and four Champions Leagues with the Catalan club, and the 2010 World Cup, either side of two European Championships, with his country.</p><p>In 2010, he scored the extra-time goal against the Netherlands to earn Spain football’s most prestigious trophy and completed the Ballon d’Or podium alongside his club team-mates Lionel Messi, the winner, and runner-up Xavi.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Before Barca’s return to Stamford Bridge, The Athletic sat down with Iniesta to analyse his style of play and some of his most memorable goals — even if, for him, it was never just about scoring.</p><p>Iniesta cannot help but smile when I mention the croquetas.</p><p>His signature dribble, passing the ball from one foot to the other, was given that name for its similar movement to that of a croquette when it rolls in a frying pan or on a plate.</p><p></p><p>Messi used to do it, as did Michael Laudrup, but it is Iniesta who is perhaps most associated with the move in the modern game. The midfielder had a talent for making the complex look easy. When you saw him on the pitch, there was something hypnotic about his way of playing.</p><p>Where did he get it from?</p><p>“My idols were Guardiola and Michael Laudrup (a Danish forward who played for Barcelona from 1989 to 1994),” Iniesta says. “Laudrup’s dribble, which he did so wonderfully, inspired me. Then I would try it in training, in a match, and in the end it became part of my game. It was something I felt comfortable with, and I usually did it quite well.”</p><p>Before joining Barca as a 12-year-old, Iniesta played as a holding midfielder for Albacete’s youth teams, and he continued in that role at La Masia — a role Guardiola filled for the club’s senior side.</p><p>In his first appearances with the Barcelona first team, Iniesta continued in the same position. He had a privileged reading of the pitch, but was physically limited by what the modern game was beginning to demand.</p><p>Watching videos of him on his debut against Brugge, he stands out for having the vision of a veteran but the legs of a youth player aged 14 or 15.</p><p>So his position changed, with Barcelona’s head coach at the time Frank Rijkaard moving him out to the left wing.</p><p>“What I liked was playing, wherever that was,” Iniesta says. “I’ve always felt most comfortable as an attacking midfielder. But I believe that systems of football have to do with how you understand the game, how you understand the team-mates around you.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“In that sense, the early years were a learning experience, when I was switching positions more often. It taught me a lot in terms of knowing what you have to do, or not do, in a certain position. Then, as time went by, perhaps it was in that attacking midfield position where I remained most stable in the centre, but it all depends on the moment, it depends on the match, it depends on many things.”</p><p>That stability came with Guardiola after his promotion to the first team in 2008. He put Iniesta in the centre of the pitch, alongside Xavi and Busquets.</p><p>It became one of the best midfields ever — yet there was a belief within the club then that Xavi and Iniesta could not play together as attacking midfielders as the team would be physically unbalanced; a view that now looks ridiculous.</p><p>The understanding between Iniesta and Xavi seemed telepathic, perhaps because Xavi also grew up mirroring Guardiola. Can that connection be trained?</p><p>“Like when you live with someone, time allows you to get to know them much better, to know their habits, their movements, what they feel comfortable with and what they don’t,” Iniesta says. “It also depends a lot on the intelligence of the other people. Both Xavi and Busi are among the best players there have ever been, so obviously that makes it easier to understand each other.”</p><p>How did they make one another better?</p><p>“In every aspect,” Iniesta says. “When you make a move and you know that person is going to give you the ball at the right moment, in the perfect place, for example, to enter the area and be able to go one-on-one with the goalkeeper, all those situations make you better.</p><p>“Beyond talking about things or not, we were very intelligent people mentally, but also visually. The fact that when you arrive young at the first team, you’re watching how Xavi moves on the pitch, how he positions himself, how he touches the ball, all those things are part of the learning process. It’s almost without you realising it, but you observe it every day. You learn on a daily basis. It’s an overall improvement. Being around the best makes you improve.”</p><p>Together, Xavi and Iniesta were magical. They moved the ball around quickly thanks to triangular passages of play and quick thinking. They worked like magnets attracting each other, as if connected by an invisible thread — partly thanks to their constant scanning during matches.</p><p>“Being a midfielder forces you to be aware of everything around you,” Iniesta says. “You’re in the middle, you have to know how to see what’s in front of you, behind you, and to the sides. The midfield is the engine, or the thermometer, of the team.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“I consider myself a very cerebral person. When I’m in places, from the moment I walk in, I know how everything is, I have everything pretty much under control. And in football, it’s the same. I’m constantly scanning everything that’s going on.</p><p>“Football is movement. An opponent is in one place one second and, two seconds later, he’s gone. That intuition or knowing what might happen, what’s behind you before you receive the ball, all those things give you those seconds of advantage to make a decision. Having all that under control always goes with personality.”</p><p>During those glorious years for the Catalans, until Xavi left for Qatari side Al Sadd in 2015, the team were nicknamed ‘El Barca de los bajitos’ (Barca of the Short Ones). Between Iniesta, Xavi and Messi, their main stars’ average height was 170cm (5ft 7in).</p><p>The Athletic asks how Iniesta and his team-mates turned that physical disadvantage in their favour.</p><p>“The most important thing is balance,” he says. “That team and that national side didn’t just have players who were 1.70m tall and weighed 68kg (150lb; 10st 10lb). There was much more to it than that.</p><p>“You have to know what kind of player you are, where your strengths and weaknesses lie. If you’re up against a player who is 1.80m tall and strong in the air, you’ll probably try to avoid a lot of aerial challenges or try to position yourself better or stay further away from him to receive the ball. Football boils down to intelligence about what you have to do and how to do it. The defender will have other tools, another way of seeing it. You have to find a way to do what you do best.</p><p>“It was more of an external perception of where football was going. There was a lot of talk about physicality and so on. We opted for a style of play. We wanted to build on our strengths, where we were good, and it worked out well because we trusted that type of play, that type of footballer, and it got results, which is what gives you strength in what you do.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Iniesta did not score many goals — 57 in his 674 appearances for Barcelona, 13 in 131 Spain games — but some of the ones he did were historic.</p><p>“I wasn’t known for long-range shots,” he says. “But my most iconic or memorable goals came from powerful shots. Even though I haven’t scored many goals, I’m happy with the ones I’ve scored.”</p><p>15 octubre 2008</p><p>Golazo de Iniesta a Bélgica en la victoria de España en Bruselas camino de la Copa del Mundo.</p><p>Han pasado 17 años.</p><p>📹: tve pic.twitter.com/oAq32nVS3A</p><p>— @Memorias_Futbol (@Memorias_Futbol) October 15, 2025</p><p></p><p>In October 2008, in a World Cup qualifying match away to Belgium, Iniesta scored the equaliser. After a defensive error, the ball reached Cesc Fabregas’ feet. He passed to Iniesta, who ran into the opposition area, nutmegged goalkeeper Stijn Stijnen with a croqueta and scored.</p><p>Iniesta smiles as he watches the move again 17 years on.</p><p>“For me, it’s one of the most beautiful goals I’ve ever scored,” he says. “It was really beautiful in every way. Because of the play, because of the difficulty in the little space there was. I nutmegged the goalkeeper as he came out. It had everything.”</p><p>Six months later, Barcelona faced Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals. The first leg at the Camp Nou ended goalless, and Barca were trailing 1-0 in the 90th minute in London. Iniesta scored in the 93rd minute to take them through, on the since-scrapped away goals rule, to the final. In Barcelona, it became known as ‘el Iniestazo’.</p><p>“It (the semi-final) was practically all lost,” Iniesta recalls. “I remember when Dani (Alves) was bringing the ball up the wing. It would have been practically the last chance we had. I remember going up to see what would happen.</p><p>“There was no clear idea. Once I was there, I was outside the area in case the cross was cleared and went out. I remember when Leo (Messi) tried to make space to shoot and the Chelsea players came out and left him behind. Then the shot was spectacular — the only place I think it could have gone (into the net). Besides, Petr Cech is a goalkeeper who is practically two metres tall. It was almost impossible for that ball to go in. It was a crazy moment.”</p><p>🙌 Hay goles que son 𝐈𝐍𝐎𝐋𝐕𝐈𝐃𝐀𝐁𝐋𝐄𝐒‼️</p><p>¡ESTO de @andresiniesta8 #TalDíaComoHoy en 2⃣0⃣0⃣9⃣!#UCL pic.twitter.com/jzYem9asPH</p><p>— Liga de Campeones (@LigadeCampeones) May 6, 2024</p><p></p><p>And then came that World Cup final goal in Johannesburg’s Soccer City stadium the following July, after 116 minutes of deadlock with the Dutch.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“It was different from the Chelsea match,” he says. “We went into extra time, we had chances to score, they went down to 10 men. The goal had to come, but there were only a few minutes left before penalties. I was feeling very strong in that match and I thought, ‘Ugh, we have to do whatever it takes to avoid penalties.’</p><p>“I was entering the area when (Fernando) Torres was on the left to make the pass. When Cesc got the ball there, I positioned myself to receive it. He’s very fast, very intelligent, and he passed me the ball. Being a little off-balance, my intention was to cross the ball. It turned out great, didn’t it?”</p><p>Minuto 116.@AndresIniesta8 para la historia. 🏆🇪🇸@SEFutbol | #CopaMundialFIFA pic.twitter.com/ZwgpG1LigX</p><p>— Copa Mundial FIFA 🏆 (@fifaworldcup_es) April 5, 2025</p><p></p><p>He celebrated by revealing a white undershirt with a message, written in blue marker-pen, which has gone down in history: “Dani Jarque, siempre con nosotros” — ‘always with us’.</p><p>Jarque was Iniesta’s friend, who played in Barcelona for Espanyol and had been a Spain youth international. He died suddenly in August 2009, aged 26, of a heart attack while at a hotel during his club’s pre-season. Iniesta had already been struggling with his mental health and tried to cope with his depression by continuing to play and ensuring fans did not notice.</p><p>“I was pretty much at rock bottom,” Iniesta says. “I started to recover once I put myself in the hands of professionals and with a lot of dedication, a lot of hard work, overcoming bad moments, average moments, good moments.</p><p>“At first, I found it very difficult to get through a training session. It was very difficult, but I had the mindset to try, even if it was only a little, to go to training. I understood that those minutes, those 10 minutes, were grains of sand that you were putting into the positive side for the days that were to come. Fortunately, with the help of many people, I was able to get through it. Those were very difficult times.”</p><p>Three years after moving to Barcelona, in 1999, Iniesta captained their team in a youth tournament final against their counterparts from Argentine side Rosario Central and scored the winning goal. Guardiola handed him the award for best player of the final as well as the competition’s overall trophy.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“In a few years, I’ll be in the stands watching you do everything you’ve done today, but with the first team,” Guardiola whispered in his ear.</p><p>“I think I have a shirt signed with that phrase,” Iniesta recalls with emotion. “It’s one of the most special moments I’ve experienced in my career. Imagine that: years later, your idol becomes your coach and what happened, happened.”</p><p>Before saying farewell, and being keenly aware he is not someone who likes to talk about himself, I read Iniesta something former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said in a news conference before that 2009 Champions League final, which Barca went on to win 2-0.</p><p>“I’m not obsessed with Messi — Iniesta is the danger,” Ferguson said. “He’s fantastic. He makes the team work. The way he finds passes, his movement and ability to create space is incredible.

Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.</p><p>When Lisa Michele Burns set out to photograph Australia in 2022, she didn’t quite realize how enormous it was.</p><p>She recalled a growing sense of panic on the second of her two four-month road trips as she drove down the never-ending highway to the outback, surrounded by nothing but rust-orange dirt, spiky spinifex grass, and the occasional gray-green mulga tree.</p><p>“That road, it’s just — it’s so straight,” said Burns. “There was a point where I had to pull over and go, ‘What are we doing? This place is so big.’”</p><p>Despite growing up in Australia — moving from its southern coastline, where bushland rolls into the sea, up to the Whitsunday Islands in central Queensland — Burns, 40, has spent most of her career abroad, capturing images of Alpine peaks, serene bamboo forests and Mediterranean coastlines.</p><p>“I probably knew more about Greenland than I did the center of Australia,” she said.</p><p>But during the coronavirus pandemic, she found herself at home, unable to travel abroad. “It became an opportunity for me to see Australia.”</p><p>Focusing on the “vibrant color palette” of Australia’s landscapes, Burns traversed the country, accompanied by her partner, to capture its diversity, from ocean blues to white sand beaches, dense green forests to rich red desert plains.</p><p>Exploring places she’d never visited, Burns found a new appreciation for her birthplace — and hopes that the images, compiled in her photobook, “Sightlines,” published last December by Images Publishing Group, can preserve the “indescribable magic” of Australia’s landscapes while sparking conversations about how to protect much-beloved natural wonders.</p><p>“I think it’s important to appreciate the variety of landscapes across Australia, but to also document them as they are today, because they are changing,” said Burns.</p><p>Due to pandemic restrictions and seasonal weather, Burns planned the trip in two halves — the first around the East coast, covering Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and the second half across South and Western Australia, and the Northern Territory — spending around eight months of 2022 on the road.</p><p>While Burns plotted the route on Google Maps and researched locations ahead of the trip, she found that on the road, often different “palettes and patterns” grabbed her attention.</p><p>“A lot of the places that became my favorite spots weren’t actually ones that I’d researched,” she said.</p><p>After finishing up early at a location in Southern Australia, Burns turned down a small road that led to Sheringa Beach, a location that became a highlight of her trip. “There was nobody else there, just us and these dunes that just roll into the turquoise sea,” she recalled.</p><p>In Western Australia, Burns visited Gantheaume Point, a “touristy spot” famous for its fossilized dinosaur footprints that surprised her with unusual patterns and vibrant colors formed in the sandstone over millennia. “I was mesmerized for days,” she said.</p><p>The photos in “Sightlines” focus more on the “smaller details within a landscape,” said Burns, providing a deeper understanding and connection with the environment. For example, the desert often appears barren and inhospitable, a huge stretch of empty sand and sky with “nothing really surviving,” said Burns: “But once you take a closer look, there are so many beautiful flora and fauna that exist in these extreme conditions.”</p><p>While Burns describes herself as an optimist and focused on the beauty of the country’s landscapes, she could see the impacts of climate change.</p><p>In the past decade, Australia has seen increasingly extreme weather events as a result of environmental damage, including intense droughts and storms, bushfires and rising sea levels.</p><p>For Burns, this was most visible around the reefs and coastlines, where rising temperatures cause coral bleaching, which reached “catastrophic levels” in the Great Barrier Reef in 2024. Last year was the hottest year on record globally, and Australia’s average temperature has increased by 1.51 Celsius since 1910, when records began.</p><p>And while driving through Southern Australia, Burns saw the aftermath of the 2019-2020 bushfires, during which more than 10 million hectares of land burned and over a billion animals are estimated to have died. “That was incredible to see. That’s where my family’s from, and I knew how huge the fires were and the impact that they had,” she said. But across the scarred landscape, Burns could “see the forest regenerating.”</p><p>“I think it is important to form a collective visual of what these landscapes look like today,” she said, adding: “Photography can raise awareness about climate change, even if it’s through beautiful imagery rather than hardcore documentary imagery. A good balance of the two across media is really important.”</p><p>Even for a landscape photographer, though, some scenes cannot be captured.</p><p>When Burns finally reached the Red Center, a landscape she’d heard so much about but never seen for herself, she felt the indescribable awe of Uluṟu — one of the world’s largest sandstone monoliths and one of Australia’s most iconic landmarks — and its red hue against the blue sky: “I didn’t realize how significant that would feel.”</p><p>Nearby, in the Valley of the Winds, no photos are allowed because it is sacred to the Aṉangu people: but for Burns, it was “one of the highlights of the entire trip,” giving her a new level of connection with the landscape.</p><p>“We lay on a platform and listened to the wind funneling down between the domes, and the birdsong,” she said. “That was really magic, because you do need to look around and observe to get those creative ideas. You just need to put the camera down, sometimes.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

{"details":"<p>They talked real estate, debated complicated zoning code, and mulled over how to get a utility giant to bring down electricity rates.</p><p>Then, they talked about what it takes to build housing in America’s largest city and how the health of the five boroughs hinges on the streets being safe.</p><p>Those were some of the topics New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump covered during a nearly hourlong meeting at the White House last week.</p><p>Mamdani, who arrived in Washington, DC, for sit-down Friday, made his way through the West Wing of the White House alongside three top aides, senior adviser Morris Katz, press secretary Dora Pekec and his chief of staff, Elle Bisgaard-Church, according to a person familiar with the meeting.</p><p>When it was finally time to enter the Oval, only Bisgaard-Church was invited. Inside was Trump and his own chief of staff, Susie Wiles.</p><p>“Our conversation focused on New York City, and I think that is a point of shared focus,” Mamdani told CNN on Sunday. “A point of shared admiration for the city that we both call home, and a city that is in danger of becoming a museum where working people once were.”</p><p>The meeting then turned into a tour, with Trump taking Mamdani into the Cabinet Room, which overlooks a now paved-over Rose Garden. The room is also home to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidential portrait. Mamdani and Trump posed in front of the painting; Trump flashed a smile and posed with his signature thumbs-up. Mamdani clasped his hands and offered a faint smile yielding a new image — three men from New York who have shaken politics in their own ways.</p><p>“It was a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani, the new Mayor of New York City!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday, sharing photos of the two after the meeting.</p><p>When the doors opened to allow cameras into the room, Trump heaped praise on Mamdani, suggesting he and the man he often falsely referred to as a “communist” actually had quite a bit in common.</p><p>“Some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have,” Trump said while sitting at his desk as Mamdani stood beside him. “We agree on a lot more than I would’ve thought.”</p><p>It was a surprisingly positive ending to a high-stakes meeting between two diametrically opposed politicians who have spent several months trading barbs.</p><p>“I can only take one meeting at a time, one conversation at a time,” Mamdani told CNN on Sunday. “All I hoped to do in that conversation was to establish a working relationship and to have a productive meeting that focused on the work itself, focused on the people that many of the two of us know, and people across these five boroughs that we never met.”</p><p>Mamdani told CNN he spoke to Trump about immigration during their meeting — with the looming question of whether the president will ramp up his immigration crackdown in New York, like he has in some other blue cities.</p><p>But even without that, the presence of federal officers and enforcement action is being felt across the city’s immigrant communities.</p><p>Advocates have reported an uptick in apprehensions and targeted operations. In response, immigrant rights organizations have started to organize, distributing “know your rights” pamphlets and training citizen patrols to spot Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and alert people who may be at risk.</p><p>While Mamdani would not say whether Trump agreed to not increase immigration enforcement in the city, he said he told the president New York City law enforcement is willing to collaborate with the federal government as long as it stays within the existing parameters. New York’s “sanctuary city” rules say local law enforcement are only required to collaborate with federal agencies on immigration enforcement only when people convicted of violent or serious crimes are involved.</p><p>“The concern comes from beyond those crimes,” Mamdani said. “The many New Yorkers who are being arrested, they’re being detained, they’re being deported for the crime of showing up to a regular court appearance at 26 Federal Plaza for the crime of simply being present in New York City.”</p><p>Trump has previously said he did not believe immigration action had gone far enough when he was asked about officers violently detaining people inside courtrooms and on city streets. On Saturday, the president appeared to back down from his previous threats to send federal reinforcements into New York City, telling reporters he would do so only if the city needs it.</p><p>Mamdani would not tell CNN on Sunday whether the president agreed with him on how to handle immigration enforcement in the city.</p><p>“I’ll let the president speak for himself, but I did make very clear that our focus comes back to public safety,” Mamdani said. “Knowing that there may be disagreements between the president and myself, and there will continue to be, and I will always make the case for each and every person that calls this city home.”</p><p>Mamdani spent the weekend in the capital after his meeting. On Friday evening, Mamdani, a fierce critic of the Israeli government, stopped at a Palestinian restaurant in Virginia for dinner.</p><p>Back in New York City on Sunday, Mamdani spoke to the congregation at Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church in the Bronx.</p><p>“My responsibility is to work,” Mamdani told the crowd. “And to do that work means to work with anyone, means to work with those who were opposed to my candidacy, work with those who belong to a different party, work with those with whom I hold deep disagreements.”</p><p>The comments came after Mamdani earlier in the day doubled down on his attacks against Trump, despite the friendly meeting.</p><p>On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the mayor-elect was asked to clarify whether he believes Trump is fascist. During the Friday meeting, Trump cut him off, jokingly telling Mamdani it was “OK” to call him one when he was asked the same question by a reporter.</p><p>“Everything I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” Mamdani responded on Sunday. “I said yes, and that’s something that I’ve said in the past.

An irate Gueye had to be restrained by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who separated the two players. Keane could be seen pointing to his head before Gueye was led down the tunnel. Pickford, along with Gueye’s Senegal team-mate Iliman Ndiaye, pleaded with him to keep his cool as he headed off.</p><p>The 37-year-old is usually a calm head and it was unusual to see him this angry. Although he did apologise to Keane, Everton and the fans over his Instagram story after the game.</p><p>“Emotions can run high but nothing justifies such behaviour,” he said. “I’ll make sure it never happens again.”</p><p>It was a remarkable incident with likely recriminations. There is now a chance Gueye will not play for Everton again before next month’s Africa Cup of Nations. It remains to be seen whether Everton take further action against either player for their role in Monday’s drama.</p><p>The Premier League match centre confirmed during the first half that the sending-off was reviewed by VAR.</p><p>The on-field referee’s decision was upheld as the action was “deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane”. The strike falls under ‘violent conduct’, which is a red-card offence.</p><p>#MUNEVE – 13’</p><p>The referee’s call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.</p><p>— Premier League Match Centre (@PLMatchCentre) November 24, 2025</p><p></p><p>Violent conduct is defined by the Football Association as: “When a player uses or attempts to use excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball, or against a team-mate, team official, match official, spectator or any other person, regardless of whether contact is made.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“In addition, a player who, when not challenging for the ball, deliberately strikes an opponent or any other person on the head or face with the hand or arm, is guilty of violent conduct unless the force used was negligible.”</p><p>The fact that Keane is Gueye’s team-mate, therefore, does not affect the decision. The action, clearly deliberate, would only have been excused by the law if the force had been “negligible”. In this instance, Harrington and VAR decided it had met this threshold.</p><p>The most recent case of a player being sent off for fighting a team-mate was in December 2008 when Stoke City’s Ricardo Fuller slapped his own captain, Andy Griffin, during a match against West Ham United. Stoke eventually lost 2-1.</p><p>“The funny thing is Rick and Griff get on very well,” manager Tony Pulis said at the time, per the Guardian. “They even had a party over Christmas at which they exchanged shirts.”</p><p></p><p>Another well-known example was in 2005 when Newcastle United team-mates Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer were sent off after exchanging punches in their top-flight home defeat by Aston Villa.</p><p>Spot the pattern.

{"details":"<p>The first time Mwezi Mugerwa saw the African golden cat, he didn’t know what it was.</p><p>While reviewing camera trap footage at Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the conservation biologist spotted an unfamiliar creature around twice the size of a domestic cat in the grainy black-and-white footage.</p><p>None of his colleagues could identify it; “but, when I talked to the hunters and communities who lived around the park, they knew the species,” Mugerwa recalls.</p><p>Known as Embaka in the local language, the “cryptic” golden cat was often caught accidentally in forest snares.</p><p>“That was really concerning for me — that we may lose this species before we even get to know about it,” says Mugerwa.</p><p>Over the past 16 years, Mugerwa has dedicated his career to “Africa’s least known, least understood, least studied big cat.” Found in dense tropical forests across Central and Western Africa, the species is so elusive that the last IUCN assessment — over a decade old — has no population estimates, and in all his years of fieldwork, Mugerwa has only managed a fleeting glimpse of the African golden cat three times with his own eyes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world’s largest environmental network of government and society organizations, tracks threatened wildlife.</p><p>“They’re really, really difficult to see in the wild,” says Mugerwa, who won the Indianapolis Prize Emerging Conservationist Award earlier this year for his work on the species.</p><p>But, realizing that accurately counting the big cats was the first step to protecting them, he set out to conduct the first population census across the species’ range, expected to publish next year.</p><p>Meet the Welsh puppies that are stopping wildlife poachers in Africa</p><p>Mugerwa knew that gathering data on the African golden cat wasn’t something he could do on his own. So, in 2019, he founded the African Golden Cat Conservation Alliance (AGCCA), a network of 46 conservationists across 19 countries.</p><p>Together, they launched a standardized camera trap survey across the cat’s suspected range, supported by funding from the National Geographic Society.</p><p>But manually reviewing thousands of images from 30 sites across 19 countries — the largest camera trap grid for any African wildlife species, says Mugerwa — “was really, really painful.”</p><p>At the same time, US-headquartered nonprofit Panthera, another of Mugerwa’s collaborators, was developing an AI algorithm that could quickly sort the images and identify individual cats based on their unique coat patterns, similar to how tiger stripes are used like fingerprints.</p><p>“That’s really important, because now we are able to speak to number and density,” says Mugerwa, adding that without AI, distinguishing individual cats would be nearly impossible due to their small size and subtle markings.</p><p>Preliminary data suggests the species exists at low densities — even in protected habitats. In Uganda and Gabon, for example, surveys found just 16 individuals per 100 square kilometers.</p><p>The surveys have also revealed the true impact of poaching: in areas with hunting restrictions, Mugerwa says cat populations were up to 50% higher, with wider distribution. The study has also observed that while the cats are active both day and night, many are strictly nocturnal — likely to avoid human activity during the day, he adds.</p><p>Establishing population numbers was just the first step. Early in his research, Mugerwa realized that hunting was the cat’s primary threat.</p><p>In East Africa, where Mugerwa is based, the African golden cat is rarely the target of hunters. But bushmeat snares, set for pigs and antelopes, are indiscriminate, often catching other species unintentionally. In 2019, Mugerwa received reports of 80 golden cats caught in snares in three Ugandan forests, 88% of which were accidental.</p><p>“We are dealing with a bushmeat crisis: the level of hunting ongoing in this forest is unsustainable and out of control,” he says, adding: “The species is being pushed to the edge of extinction in many of its range countries.”</p><p>To combat the cat’s biggest threat, Mugerwa went directly to the residents, creating Embaka: the first community-based anti-poaching conservation project focused on the African golden cat.</p><p>Meet the conservationist saving gorillas in Uganda’s ‘impenetrable forest’</p><p>Working with over 8,000 families across the cat’s range, including Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Uganda, the project engages local communities — many of whom are former poachers — to deploy camera traps and report sightings.</p><p>“We have learned a lot from local communities; the range expansion, for instance, some of that data comes from hunters,” says Mugerwa. Embaka offers incentives like dental care and livestock support to encourage communities to “speak out against hunting” and protect the forest ecosystem.</p><p>Bringing reformed hunters on board not only reduces the threat the cats will face from hunting, but it also “improves the relationship between the African golden cat and the communities,” says Mugerwa.</p><p>“It also allows the local communities to own and to be part of the camera trap grid, which is really beautiful to see,” he adds.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron is calling for a targeted screening programme for prostate cancer after revealing that he has been treated for the disease.</p><p>Speaking to British newspaper The Times in an interview published Sunday, Cameron, 59, revealed that his wife Samantha had encouraged him to get a test for prostate cancer.</p><p>“You always hope for the best,” said Cameron, who initially went for a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which evaluates levels of proteins linked to prostate cancer.</p><p>His result was concerningly high, but Cameron said he remained optimistic. “You have a high PSA score – that’s probably nothing,” he said.</p><p>‘Grey’s Anatomy’ star James Pickens Jr. opens up about his prostate cancer diagnosis, touts early detection</p><p>“You have an MRI scan with a few black marks on it. You think, ‘Ah, that’s probably OK.’ But when the biopsy comes back, and it says you have got prostate cancer?” he added.</p><p>“You always dread hearing those words. And then literally as they’re coming out of the doctor’s mouth you’re thinking, ‘Oh, no, he’s going to say it. He’s going to say it. Oh God, he said it,’” said Cameron, who now sits in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the British parliament.</p><p>After receiving focal therapy, which involves using needles to transmit electric pulses that break down the cancer, Cameron decided to join calls for more screening.</p><p>Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in the United States, behind non-melanoma skin cancers.</p><p>About 11% of American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, while around 2.5% will die from it, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>What are your questions about prostate cancer?</p><p>Most prostate cancers grow very slowly, and it typically takes at least 10 years for cancer that hasn’t spread beyond the prostate to cause significant symptoms.</p><p>Most prostate cancers picked up by blood tests that measure levels of PSA will not harm men during their lifetimes and don’t require treatment, according to the results of a long-running UK study published in 2023.</p><p>As a result, many experts question whether the costs of mass screening programs outweigh the benefits, due to the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatments.</p><p>But Cameron agrees with the charity Prostate Cancer Research that a program targeting high-risk men, which makes use of advances in medical science such as the focal therapy that he received, would be beneficial to public health.</p><p>“The circumstances are changing,” he told The Times. “The arguments are changing, and so it’s a really good moment to have another look at this.”</p><p>Cameron now plans to use his position in the House of Lords to push for change.</p><p>“I’ve got a platform.

{"details":"<p>EDITOR’S NOTE:  This story contains disturbing images.</p><p>In the chaotic aftermath of Tanzania’s disputed presidential election last month, police and gun-wielding men on patrol shot at groups of protesters, many of whom appeared unarmed or were holding only rocks and sticks, a CNN investigation has found.</p><p>Geolocated videos from the scenes, audio forensic analysis of the shots fired and first-hand accounts from witnesses and victims document the brutality unleashed on young demonstrators following the re-election of President Samia Suluhu Hassan – who claimed she won with 98% of the vote on October 29 after barring her chief rivals from the presidential race.</p><p>Videos verified by CNN also support witness reports about the deadly toll of the post-election crackdown, showing morgues overflowing with scores of bodies.</p><p>Additionally, satellite images and videos show recently disturbed soil consistent with reports of mass graves in the Kondo cemetery, north of the East African country’s main city of Dar es Salaam. Two human rights groups and witnesses interviewed by CNN say the bodies of protesters killed in the past few weeks have been buried there.</p><p>After the election, authorities imposed a curfew and an internet blackout as people gathered in the streets to contest the exclusion of Hassan’s rivals from the polls. The main opposition party leader, Tundu Lissu, has been in custody since April, charged with treason.</p><p>When internet connectivity was partially restored a week later, police barred the sharing of photos and videos “that cause panic.” Government officials initially denied any killings of protesters had occurred. Last week, however, the president acknowledged there had been some casualties, but she did not release any figures.</p><p>Hassan on Thursday launched a commission to investigate the unrest, but also suggested that protesters were paid.</p><p>In a press conference Sunday, Tanzania’s government spokesperson Gerson Msigwa called the investigation a “biased report” intended to “mislead and incite” accusing CNN of not giving Tanzanian authorities opportunity to respond. CNN sent detailed questions to Msigwa, the police and the country’s ministry of health, but did not receive a response.</p><p>“If they want to find us, we’re available. We’ll answer their questions. We’re not blocking them from doing their job. But they should do it professionally and fairly,” Msigwa said. The commission of inquiry is in process, he added.</p><p>In a statement posted on X Tuesday, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee demanded an independent investigation of the “tragic acts” in Tanzania, citing CNN’s reporting. “This report underscores the disturbing actions by the Tanzanian Government to suppress protestors,” the committee said, linking to the CNN story. “Evidence of mass graves show an unacceptable attempt to cover-up gross violations of human rights.”</p><p>The crackdown on protesters has marred the reputation of Tanzania as a stable democracy that attracts millions of tourists every year.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Office, based on information from multiple sources in the country, suggested hundreds of protesters and other civilians were killed, with an unknown number injured or detained.</p><p>With the help of open-source investigator Benjamin Strick, CNN reviewed dozens of videos and images of civilians lying dead from gunshot wounds, as well as images of bodies overflowing morgues at the Sekou-Toure Regional Referral Hospital in Mwanza and the Mwananyamala Hospital in Dar es Salaam.</p><p>In Mwanza, photos and videos geolocated by CNN outside the hospital show at least 10 bodies piled up on a stretcher.</p><p>One doctor, who treated victims of gunshot wounds over the course of four days there and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the dead were brought to the morgue by police “until it was full.” After that, he said, they “piled” the bodies outside the hospital.</p><p>Many victims, both dead and injured, were young men, the doctor said. “All had sustained gunshot wounds on different parts of the body. Especially the head, abdomen, chest, lower limbs. Badly wounded patients with varying degrees of consciousness,” he told CNN.</p><p>In Dar es Salaam, a video geolocated by CNN at the morgue of Mwananyamala Hospital shows dozens of bodies covering the floor, piled up on top of each other. Tanzania’s Ministry of Health denied the authenticity of the footage in a statement on social media. The ministry did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.</p><p>A woman, who requested anonymity out of concern for her safety, told CNN she saw the video from the morgue and recognized the body of her brother, who was killed during the protests on the balcony of his own home. “We’ve been looking for his body at every mortuary in Dar es Salaam since 1st November, but he was not there,” she told CNN.</p><p>According to witnesses, demonstrations broke out shortly after polls opened on October 29 and continued for a few days after in some locations. In one violent encounter analyzed by CNN, Tanzanian police in the city of Arusha fatally shot two protesters who appeared to be no threat to them – a pregnant woman who was shot in the back while running away, and a young man who was shot in the head.</p><p>At 3:27 p.m. the day of the election, a group of young men who were gathered at an intersection, were confronted by about 10 armed police officers. One protester appears to be seen throwing a rock at them.</p><p>Two minutes later, the scene becomes frantic, according to a video circulating on social media which Strick first geolocated. CNN obtained the original footage and confirmed his findings by analyzing its metadata.</p><p>In the video, demonstrators are seen running down the road amid bursts of gunfire. One woman wearing a lavender top and a hat, holding a stick and a rock, is fatally shot in the back as she’s running with other protesters. She drops to the ground, blood coming out of her blouse. Other demonstrators attempt unsuccessfully to help the woman to her feet and administer aid.</p><p>In another video, a woman can be heard asking the mortally injured woman  to wake up. The protesters, in distress, can be heard calling for help.</p><p>A forensic analysis of the scene shows that the woman was shot from behind: a hole in the blouse, the entry point of the bullet, can be seen shortly after a gunshot is heard. Moments later, the woman drops the stick and stone, and collapses.</p><p>Sources close to her family confirmed to CNN that the woman was three months pregnant, leaving behind a husband and two children.</p><p>Rob Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined audio extracted from the original video of the shooting.</p><p>Based on the time gap between the “crack” sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet and the “boom” of the muzzle blast, Maher established the distance between the firearm and microphone of the device that filmed the video to be about 112 meters (367 feet).</p><p>A few minutes later, a video filmed from the other side of the road shows a protester dressed in black walking towards the police position at the top of the road. Another protester throws a rock, a shot rings out and a different man with a red shirt is seen collapsing, with a visible head injury. The video was first geolocated by Strick, the open-source investigator, and verified by CNN.</p><p>Another video of the encounter shows the man lying in a pool of blood, still breathing. “Oh my God, this is our Tanzania,” repeats the person filming, along with a Muslim prayer. The man was visible in earlier footage, holding a rock, but he didn’t appear to have anything in his hands when he was shot and killed.</p><p>The victim was at least 95 meters away from police at the time he was shot, according to an audio analysis by Maher. Both this distance and the one calculated in the video of the shooting of the pregnant woman correspond to the visible location of police at the top of the road, according to CNN’s analysis.</p><p>An eyewitness to both shootings told CNN the Arusha protest had started peacefully until police started firing at them. The witness saw the pregnant woman being shot in front of her.</p><p>“I tried to call for help from others to pull her (the pregnant woman) aside because she was still breathing but shots kept getting fired and it hit one young man on the head. It was the most inhumane thing ever,” the witness said. “Someone’s mother died while I and others watched.”</p><p>In other parts of the country, videos have surfaced on social media of security officers and of armed men in plain clothes – who locals suspect are police – pursuing protesters and opening fire on them. CNN has geolocated several videos showing what appear to be plainclothes officers getting off white pick-up trucks in Dar es Salaam and opening fire in the backstreets of civilian areas.</p><p>A series of drone videos filmed in the Segerea area of the city, along Tabata Road, shows protesters fleeing and taking shelter in courtyards of a side street, as a white pick-up truck approaches. Armed individuals are then seen getting off the truck and opening fire repeatedly as they roam around a civilian area.</p><p>The armed men were filmed operating alongside uniformed police officers in the Ubungo area of Dar es Salaam.</p><p>Viral Scout Management, a local sports management consultancy, released a statement on X saying that seven young soccer players under their contracts were shot and killed at their homes during the protests. The management firm later posted on X that the bodies of six of them could not be located.</p><p>The woman who recognized her brother in the Mwananyamala morgue footage told CNN the family had not located the body of another of her brothers reportedly shot dead at home in the Mara region.</p><p>Allegations of mass graves have emerged in the past few weeks, with Chadema, the main opposition political party, accusing police of disposing of hundreds of unknown bodies at undisclosed locations.</p><p>A coalition of Tanzanian human rights groups and two local sources told CNN that some of the bodies of the protesters killed after October 29 in Dar es Salaam were buried in a mass grave at the Kondo cemetery in Kunduchi, north of the city.</p><p>High-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs and Vantor taken on November 9 and November 15 shows disturbed ground in a barren plot of land 60 meters from the edge of existing graves. Further analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery shows that the digging was done there between November 2 and November 5.</p><p>A video filmed on the ground after the soil was disturbed, and obtained by CNN, shows a series of spots of sandy, overturned soil, that weave between patches of vegetation. The exact reason for the disturbance is unclear. In one area of the fresh soil, what appear to be roots stick out, and atop another is what appears to be a couple of articles of fabric.</p><p>CNN’s Oliver Sherwood contributed to this report.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos, in compliance with our policy.</p><p>The mountainous Bodrum Peninsula rises over the vibrant blue Aegean Sea, its peak richly forested, its foothills stacked with white flat-roofed homes and hotels.</p><p>On the peninsula’s exclusive northern coastline, superyachts bob between the ultra-luxury villas and hotels of Paradise Bay. In Bodrum town on the southern shore, traditional gulet sailing boats fill the marina, ready to take tourists on cruises.</p><p>Today, it’s where Istanbul’s elite come to relax, party, or be pampered, and where international visitors travel for sunshine and sea.</p><p>They are by no means the first people of means to have left their mark here. From the Leleges to the Mycenaeans, from the Romans to the Byzantines, many civilizations have risen and fallen on the peninsula, leaving archaeological treasures in their wake.</p><p>The greatest of all, built around 350 BCE on a hilltop overlooking what is now Bodrum town, was the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was all the more remarkable because it was created as the result of an incestuous marriage.</p><p>Very little remains of the mausoleum today. Today, the biggest historical structure is Bodrum Castle, a huge Gothic fortress overlooking the marina. The region’s importance as a tourism hub is just the latest chapter in its long history of strategic significance.</p><p>“It’s like a gateway between East and West,” says Orhan Can, a guide with Bodrum Tour, pointing out that even today Istanbul is the best connected airport in the world. Turkey “has always been a place for business.”</p><p>The Mausoleum’s occupants, more than two millennia ago, were Mausolus and his sister-wife Artemesia II, members of the Hectamnod dynasty which ruled over the region then known as Caria between 395 and 366 BCE.</p><p>Mausolus and Artemisia made Halicarnassus — now Bodrum — the capital of Caria, boosting its population and initiating many building projects, the most extravagant being their tomb. After Mausolus’s death in 353 BCE, Artemisia oversaw its construction, a temple-like structure designed by the finest Greek architects and sculptors, combining Greek, Egyptian, and Lycian styles.</p><p>Decorated with friezes of battle scenes and some 400 freestanding sculptures, its base was more than 400 feet in circumference. It was topped by a pyramid upon which rode a four-horse chariot containing statues of the departed couple.</p><p>Artemisia held a grand funeral for her husband, with games and ceremonies. “After Mausolus died, they cremated him,” says Can. Legend has it that Artemesia, the grieving sister-widow, drank her husband’s ashes mixed with wine, which would later become a popular subject for Renaissance painters in the Western world.</p><p>She succeeded him as leader, becoming a noted naval commander, but outlived him by just two years. Legend has it that her early death was “because she was so sad,” says Can.</p><p>A series of earthquakes from the 12th to 15th century led to the monument’s collapse. At Bodrum Mausoleum Museum, visitors to the archaeological park look down, not up, into the sunken foundations excavated by British archaeologist Charles Newton in the 19th century. Broken pieces of the 36 columns that once sat under the tomb’s pyramid are scattered all around, while steps lead down to Mausolus and Artemesia’s burial chamber. The mausoleum’s drainage system has also survived.</p><p>Newton transported the prize pieces to the British Museum in London, but some original friezes and recently discovered architectural fragments are on display in the park’s small museum.</p><p>However, surviving relics from the Halicarnassus era, and from the mausoleum itself, are still found throughout Bodrum and as far as 2,000 miles beyond.</p><p>Together, these archaeological puzzle pieces build a picture of life, and death, in one of antiquity’s most thriving harbor cities. Here’s how to follow the treasure trail.</p><p>Bodrum’s horseshoe-shaped Antique Theater, built during Mausolus’s reign and then expanded 200 years later during the Roman era, is a 20-minute walk uphill from the mausoleum site.</p><p>The theater looks out over the bay towards Bodrum Castle, the construction of which was fortified in the 15th century with marble columns and green volcanic stone from the ruins of the mausoleum.</p><p>At its peak, up to 10,000 people could be seated here to view everything from theatrical plays, to gladiator battles, to wild animal fights.</p><p>Entertainment today is more sedate. Concerts and cultural events are still held here, to audiences of nearly 4,000, but on the day CNN visits we share this space with just a well-behaved school group and one selfie-taking couple.</p><p>Mount Nemrut: Where colossal stone gods guard a 2,000-year-old mystery</p><p>Mausolus “built a lot of things back in those days,” says Can. “He made Caria more Greek. He started making people worship Greek gods and goddesses. He started to build temples for them.”</p><p>His expensive projects earned him a reputation as a tyrant, with finds raised through taxes, including one reputedly on Lycian men’s hair.</p><p>“He said to them, ‘give me your long hair, or you pay me tax,’” explains Can. “But he wasn’t wasting the hair. He was using them for the wigs of aristocrat Persians.”</p><p>One of these projects was building defensive walls around the city. Two gates guarded the east and the west of Halicarnassus, with the remains of the western Myndos Gate still standing on a hillside in the Eskiçeşme neighborhood, within walking distance of the theater.</p><p>The original height of the monumental towers of andesite stone is not known, but their sturdy bases have stood for close to 2,400 years. There is also a fourth-century necropolis nearby with Roman and Hellenistic vaulted tombs.</p><p>One of the most poignant parts of the site is the 23-feet-wide, eight-feet-deep moat which, during the Siege of Halicarnassus in 334 BCE, for some time held off the forces of Alexander the Great. Many soldiers lost their lives by falling into the moat or being trampled upon, while the collapse of an overloaded bridge also resulted in many casualties.</p><p>Back down on the waterfront, Bodrum Castle, an imposing example of Gothic architecture with Ottoman additions, dominates the modern town and also offers the city’s best views over the bay. It’s been on the UNESCO Tentative List of World Heritage sites since 2016.</p><p>It was built by the Knights of Saint John, who ruled over Bodrum throughout the 15th century. Not only were parts of Mausolus’s tomb used in the castle’s construction, but the castle is on the same promontory regarded to be the likely site of Mausolus’s palace.</p><p>For your 20-euro entrance fee, it’s a multiple-whammy historical experience. As well as being home to the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, it has a wealth of artifacts from the many civilizations that have called this corner of the world home. Its display related to the late Bronze Age Mycenaean people is particularly impressive.</p><p>The ancient monastery hanging from the side of a cliff</p><p>To see the remains of a woman who was likely the little sister of Mausoleus and Artemesia, head to the Carian Princess exhibit in the museum’s upper levels.</p><p>A stone sarcophagus was found in 1989 at a necropolis site in the Yokuşbaşı neighborhood of Bodrum containing a well-preserved skeleton of a high-born woman, along with a gold crown and jewels. She is believed to be Ada, fifth ruler of the Hecatomnid dynasty. Her remains are on display in the museum, along with her belongings and a full-size model based on a facial reconstruction of her skull.</p><p>Hecatomnus was Caria’s first indigenous satrap — the term for regional governors in the Persian empire — and ruled from 395 to 377 BCE. Of his five children, two sets of siblings married each other, with the brother-sister couple Idrieus and Ada succeeding Mausoleus and Artemesia.</p><p>Neither couple had children, so the marriages may have been symbolic. Sibling marriage was not at all common at this time, with incest generally considered taboo.</p><p>“I think back in those days, for royal people, it was okay to do anything they want to do,” says Can. The general population “were accepting whatever they did.”</p><p>Intermarriage between the siblings strengthened the dynasty by keeping the bloodline in the family. It also mirrored the mythology of the Greek gods, such as the union of king Zeus and his queen and sister-wife Hera.</p><p>Ada’s unusual high-status connections don’t end with the marriage to her brother Idrieus. She ruled over Caria twice, with reigns before and after the Siege of Halicarnassus, having being reinstated to power by her adopted son, Alexander the Great.</p><p>The shoreline around Bodrum is lined with beachside restaurants, beaches and bars, but it’s still possible to leave the crowds behind and ascend into the quiet forests of its mountainous interior. Here, the landscape is much as it was in ancient times.</p><p>Hidden high on a hilltop and visited by few, just a few miles’ hike from Bodrum town center, is the ancient city of Pedasa, which dates as far back as the 12th century BCE. In the fourth century, Mausolus ruled that the inhabitants of Pedasa and other smaller settlements be relocated to Halicarnassus, to boost the population of the newly established capital.</p><p>Pedasa is a stop on the 510-mile Carian Trail, a long-distance hiking route around the region that visits beaches, hills, villages and archaeological wonders. “In Turkey, there are so many ruins, and there’s so many civilizations, and we wanted to focus on the Carian features,” Altay Özcan, co-founder of the trail, tells CNN. Despite the area’s popularity with tourists, it’s still possible for visitors to get “a stretch of nature to yourself,” he says.</p><p>Pedasa is a “hidden gem,” says Can, as is Labraunda, “a sanctuary of Zeus. It’s on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere and it’s like a little Machu Picchu. Idrieus, the brother of Mausolus, built most of it.”</p><p>Shortly before his death of unknown causes, Mausolus survived an assassination attempt during a royal procession at Labraunda during an annual festival. The ruins are about an hour’s drive from Bodrum, on the other side of Bodrum-Milas Airport.</p><p>What really happens inside a Turkish bath</p><p>It’s hard to go far in Turkey without tripping over an archaeological treasure, but there are still plenty more wonders hidden underground.</p><p>Gümüşlük is a pretty fishing village on the Bodrum Peninsula’s western coast, known for its seaside restaurants. At low tide, you can wade out from the harborside mermaid restaurant along the “King’s Road,” an ancient path that may date back 3,500 years to the Mycenaean era. It leads to a grassy mound known as Rabbit Island, the visible tip of what was once the city of Myndos, established by the Lelegian civilization some 4,000 years ago.</p><p>The island is fenced off due to uncompleted excavation work, but the city itself is thought to extend underground through Gümüşlük itself.</p><p>Two lion sculptures from the mausoleum now stand at the entrance of the British Museum’s Front Hall in London. The main mausoleum exhibit is in the museum’s Room 21, with other pieces in Rooms 77 and 81.</p><p>The walls are a gentle gray-blue, like the sea on a winter’s day, and the sand-colored tiles underfoot complement the marble statues and the slab friezes that line the room.</p><p>A colossal statue of a horse, from the chariot group which crowned the tomb, stands at the top of the staircase with head bowed and muscles flaring.</p><p>The friezes depict battles between Greeks and Amazons and Greek and Centaurs. In the Amazon frieze, a female warrior prepares to strike a kneeling Greek, while another Amazon appears to cry out for mercy as a caped Greek pulls her back by the hair.</p><p>In the center of the room are the two statues traditionally identified as Artemesia and Mausolus, both well over eight feet tall. Their poses are relaxed, their tunics and gathered mantles draped over their chest and thighs to their sandaled feet.</p><p>Artemesia’s face is shattered stone, but above it remains her hairstyle of three rolls of curls under a fitted cap. Mausolus’s head, with its wavy hair reaching shoulders some three feet wide, is largely intact. Under arched brows in a full, handsome face, his deep-set eyes gaze imperiously, thoughtfully, the hint of an Elvis pout curling at his lips.</p><p>Two-thousand miles from home, more than 2,000 years from their place in history, these effigies of brother and sister, of husband and wife, look blindly down on the stream of visitors in a future they could never have imagined.</p><p>The tomb which held them, the robust structure from which they hoped to stand forever over Bodrum and the blue Aegean, was lost centuries ago to the crashing waves of nature, which wash over all.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former President John F. Kennedy, revealed on Saturday she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, with a doctor telling her she has less than a year to live.</p><p>In an essay in The New Yorker, the 35-year-old wrote that she was diagnosed last year with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation known as Inversion 3, a genetic anomaly found in less than 2% of AML cases.</p><p>Doctors discovered the cancer shortly after Schlossberg gave birth to her daughter in May 2024.</p><p>“I did not — could not — believe that they were talking about me,” Schlossberg wrote. “I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn’t sick. I didn’t feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.”</p><p>In the essay, Schlossberg documents the grueling treatment process, which included several rounds of chemotherapy, two bone-marrow transplants and participation in two clinical trials. Schlossberg said she was also diagnosed with a form of Epstein-Barr virus in September, which “blasted my kidneys,” and had to learn to walk again.</p><p>“During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,” she wrote.</p><p>Schlossberg, an environmental journalist, is the second daughter of former US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and designer Edwin Schlossberg. Tatiana Schlossberg and her husband, George Moran, have a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter.</p><p>Schlossberg said her siblings — Rose, a filmmaker, and Jack, who earlier this month announced a run for Congress — have been helping raise her children and “have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered, trying not to show their pain and sadness in order to protect me from it.”</p><p>Schlossberg described going through treatment as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, after “running for President as an Independent, but mostly as an embarrassment to me and the rest of my immediate family.”</p><p>She said the doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where she was treated, didn’t know whether they would be affected after the Trump administration stripped Columbia University of federal funding. “Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,” Schlossberg wrote. The university later agreed a deal with the Trump administration to restore the funding.</p><p>Schlossberg said she regrets adding to her family’s history of tragedy, which includes John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and the assassination of her great-uncle, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968.</p><p>“For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,” she writes. “Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family’s life, and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.”</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

{"details":"<p>Joseph DeAngelo moved through California neighborhoods like a shadow.</p><p>He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.</p><p>What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the Golden State Killer.</p><p>DeAngelo killed at least 13 people and raped dozens more in the 1970s and 1980s. In April 2018, nearly four decades after his last known crimes, police armed with DNA evidence surrounded his house in the quiet Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights and arrested him.</p><p>Dressed in a T-shirt, cargo shorts and tube socks, a shocked DeAngelo offered no resistance when detectives moved in after he stepped into his yard. In a jarring contrast to the cruelty he once inflicted, the predator who’d terrorized residents in 11 counties did not fight back. But he protested in a high-pitched voice, ‘I have a roast in the oven!’”</p><p>Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.</p><p>“He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “The People vs. the Golden State Killer.” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”</p><p>Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.</p><p>DeAngelo was convicted of multiple murders in August 2020 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p>Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.</p><p>CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.</p><p>Serial Killers Fast Facts</p><p>He didn’t realize that his mental defense didn’t work, because this isn’t the first time he tried it. In 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer, he was caught by store security, and he was acting like he was crazy, mumbling to himself, saying crazy things. And when the police came, he admitted he was pretending to be crazy, hoping that security wouldn’t call them. He has used this technique of pretending to be crazy, so we knew it was fake.</p><p>It did. The first series of crimes, he was the Visalia Ransacker from 1974 to 1975. There were 120 burglaries in a three-mile square radius. It turned out he was a police officer in a nearby town, and he was on the task force to find the Visalia Ransacker, and he was the ransacker. He left Visalia in central California and moved up to Sacramento, where he started committing rapes there. As a police officer, he knew how everything operated, how long it took to respond to the scene, where they would set up their blockades and how to get around that. He used his expert knowledge as a police officer to commit his crimes, find his victims and then escape.</p><p>It was that insatiable appetite for power.</p><p>When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.</p><p>And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.</p><p>And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.</p><p>After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.</p><p>We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.</p><p>A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.</p><p>During the impact statement, she says, ‘I’ve brought somebody here with me today that was also a victim, and her name is Bonnie.’ And Bonnie comes up. And Bonnie was actually engaged to DeAngelo about 40 years ago but had broken up with him.</p><p>And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.</p><p>Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’</p><p>It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.</p><p>When I think about the case now, I don’t think about him or the crimes. I think about the survivors. One of them, Phyllis Hennemann, was the very first rape victim in Sacramento. She was diagnosed with cancer, and when it was time for court she couldn’t be there because she was having chemo. But when DeAngelo was sentenced, I looked across the courtroom, and there’s Phyllis sitting there. And she had this twinkle on her eye. For the first time in 40 years, she got justice. About three months later, she died from cancer. I think about her a lot … that we were able to get her that justice.</p><p>DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.</p><p>And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.</p><p>The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.</p><p>I do. His last known crime was the 1986 murder of Janelle Cruz in Orange County. People ask me, ‘Why did he stop in 1986’? And my answer is, ‘How do you know he stopped in 1986?’</p><p>There’s a three-year period from 1986 to 1989, when he was living in LA, that we’re not sure exactly where he was and what he was doing. And he was already beginning to evolve as a killer. So what’s to say he didn’t continue to kill his victims, but he discarded the bodies somewhere that we never found?</p><p>I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.</p><p>I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.</p><p>He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.</p><p>So he’s in his own version of hell, where he belongs.</p><p>© 2025 Cable News Network.

The ratings are expressed in points per game, with higher values indicating stronger teams. To get an estimated point spread between two teams, subtract the lower team’s power rating from the higher team’s and add 1½ points for home-field advantage. To determine the chances each team has to win the division and make the playoffs, we simulated every regular season game 25,000 times using these power ratings, with recent performance weighted more heavily.

{"details":"<p>Test your eye for visual effects in “Wicked: For Good” and other blockbusters.</p><p>In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.</p><p>But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.</p><p>“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”</p><p>Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.</p><p>To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>2. Production</p><p>3. Postproduction</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Preproduction</p><p>Production</p><p>Postproduction</p><p>The planning stage where visual research and on-set targets are worked out.</p><p>Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.</p><p>“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.</p><p>Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.</p><p>“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”</p><p>Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.</p><p>But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because director Jon M. Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (“Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)</p><p>Take a look below at how “Severance” planned out its Season 2 opening using rough 3D models.</p><p>An animatic, or basic animation with simple, undetailed 3D models, helped the “Severance” crew plan the exact cadence, camera angles and more.</p><p></p><p>In this first shot, a Bolt motion camera uses a robotic arm for rapid back-and-forth shots.</p><p>Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-</p><p>generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.</p><p>The visual effects team also coordinates with other departments to ensure production goes smoothly.</p><p>“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.</p><p>The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”</p><p>Case in point: “Wicked” used exclusively blue screens because of how prominent green is in the story, including Elphaba’s skin, the Emerald City and guard uniforms. And certain scenes required a scale that was unrealistic to build. So instead, production design built interior sets up to 25 feet and exterior sets up to 55 feet. Visual effects took care of the rest.</p><p>“Filmmaking is one of the those disciplines where everything is done through collaborating with each other,” said Helman. “There are about 1,000 people just on visual effects” for the “Wicked” films, he said. He added, “We all put a little bit into the creative process so that the movie has texture and has layers.”</p><p>2. Production</p><p>Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>1. Preproduction</p><p>3.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.</p><p>In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day of to deal with too.</p><p>“Maybe it was this perfect shot of the sunset, and my two leads were finally getting together. And a car drove by in the background that no one knew about,” said ILM’s Eric Leven, the visual effects supervisor for Season 2 of “Severance.”</p><p>Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.</p><p>That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.</p><p>Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.</p><p>Early, simple 3D models can also help directors and actors in the shooting process. James Cameron’s Avatar films, which feature the blue alien species called Na’vi, heavily relied on a depth compositing tool that rendered those aliens, CGI objects and environments in real time on the camera screen as filming took place.</p><p>“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”</p><p>The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.</p><p>This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.</p><p>“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.</p><p>The “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage. This allows James Cameron to walk through an empty set but see things as if he were filming in</p><p>real time.</p><p>How the “Avatar” crew used a virtual camera to compose scenes</p><p>This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.</p><p>A cluster of spheres attached to the back of the rig lets the computer know where the camera is.</p><p>These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.</p><p>Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

Marketing and trailers start in earnest at this stage.</p><p>Once shooting wraps, the postproduction phase begins and the team puts together the final product.</p><p>“[“Jurassic World Rebirth” director] Gareth Edwards said that prep and shoot is where you go shopping for your meal, and post is where you actually get to cook it,” said Vickery.</p><p>The visual effects team works in close conjunction with the director and editor throughout this phase. Artists will create rough drafts of the visual effects with the real footage for the director’s approval and feedback. The editor will incorporate the evolving VFX shots into the main edit. As the shots come together, the director can see the overall flow of the film and slowly, the picture comes alive.</p><p>“In visual effects, everything happens in layers,” said Helman. “There could be 30, 40 people working on one shot at the same time.”</p><p>The number of visual effects shots can rack up quickly. “Jurassic World Rebirth” had about 1,500 VFX shots; “Wicked: For Good” had about 2,000, and “Avatar: The Way of Water” had more than 3,200. Comparatively, a 2010 study found that the average number of total shots per movie (both non-VFX and VFX) was about 1,100.</p><p>But Helman emphasizes that regardless of how many shots there are, the end goal is to make a cohesive story. “It always goes back to sitting around a fire with a bunch of people at night, listening to somebody telling a story. You’re just changing the tools a little bit. And that’s all we are. We are a tool to tell a story,” Helman said.</p><p>Leven estimates a single visual effect shot passes through four to six people and takes three to six weeks to complete. The hallway run in Season 2 of “Severance” — including previs and postvis teams and people on set —  involved about 20 to 25 people for the two-minute scene.</p><p>A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual one in a CG world.</p><p>Environmental specialists build the CG world.

Maybe the edges of moving hair don’t quite have the right amount of blur. Maybe a door looks too narrow. The “Wicked” team, for example, paid particular attention to the animals so they could get across emotional nuances despite limited facial expressions.</p><p>And if that weren’t enough, the marketing team starts its job well in advance of the finish line. “It’s like releasing an ad campaign out before the product’s ready,” said Vickery. Audience screenings often happen midway through postproduction, and trailers are needed before the film is finished. “They’re definitely things that make for a lot of hard work from the visual effects department.”</p><p>This year’s “Superman,” for example, released a trailer that got some people up in arms over a oddly edited shot of Superman flying. Fans claimed there was “bad CGI” on actor David Corenswet’s face, but director James Gunn later said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was just an unfinished VFX composite shot that’s “not even the shot that’s in the movie.”</p><p>At the end of the day, even the best visual effects team can be undercut by unreasonable expectations and timelines. And for the artists, it can be frustrating when only the worst of their work gets noticed.</p><p>“What [the audience has] to understand is that visual effects artists are incredibly passionate artists who put a lot of love and care and attention into what they do. … [You] don’t see 90 percent of the visual effects work that they do. [You] only notice the 10 or 5 percent that’s not perfectly executed,” said Vickery.</p><p>Leven also echoed similar sentiments and explained poor work is rarely because of a lack of talent or technology.</p><p>“Usually the effects artists working on it don’t have enough time. Maybe it was a last-minute addition. Maybe there wasn’t a clear vision from the filmmakers as to what they wanted,” Leven said. “There are a lot of different reasons, but it’s usually not because CGI is not capable of making the shot look amazing.”</p><p>And when artists do manage to pull it off? Well, you probably won’t even notice.</p><p>About this story</p><p>Video and photos: Industrial Light & Magic; Wētā FX; Universal Pictures; Amblin Entertainment; 20th Century Studios; Apple TV.</p><p>Icons from iStock.</p>","headline":"Can you tell when you’re seeing CGI in movies and TV shows?","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/interactive/2025/wicked-severance-avatar-jurassic-world-rebirth-cgi-effects/","message":"","updatedAt":"2025-11-24T11:05:00.000Z"}
