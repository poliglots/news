    "details": "President Zelensky says giving Ukrainian territory to Russia is the \"main problem\" after talks on a US-backed peace planThe US and Ukraine held weekend talks in Geneva - Donald Trump says \"don't believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening\"But, speaking in a video message to a Swedish conference, Zelensky says Putin \"wants legal recognition to what he has stolen\" - and he later insists \"borders cannot be changed by force\"The US said \"revisions and clarifications\" were made to the plan in Geneva - Russia says it is yet to see any updates\"Disgraceful\" - or worth it \"if it stops the war\"? The BBC has spoken to Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline to see what they think of the peace planAfter the peace talks in Geneva, there are still mixed messages about progress towards reaching an agreement - here’s what we know this morning.Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\", adding that the proposal simply \"won't work\".An army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\". He says Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\".\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"He says he has informed President of Finland Alexander Stubb, President of the European Council António Costa, and President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda about the meeting in Geneva on Sunday.\"Ukraine is working as constructively as possible,\" he says. \"And now it is especially important that every step we take together with partners is carefully balanced, and all decisions are workable and ensure lasting peace and guaranteed security.\"In a separate social media post, Zelensky shared his earlier address to the Swedish parliament, stressing that \"borders cannot be changed by force\", and \"the aggressor must pay fully for the war he started\".We've heard that an updated peace framework has been drawn up after talks during the weekend - though details haven't been announced.But several media outlets, including Reuters news agency, have reported the text of an alternative plan drafted by Kyiv's European allies. The BBC has not independently verified its contents, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has denied any knowledge of its existence.German government spokesperson Sebastian Hille has praised \"progress\" made in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine over the weekend.Speaking to reporters in Berlin, he says Germany sees it \"very positively that there is finally progress again\" and welcomes things \"moving forward\".This follows comments made by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said earlier that he had stressed to US President Donald Trump the negative consequences for Europe if Ukraine were to collapse following defeat in the war.President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov says that officially the Kremlin has not received any information on the results of the Geneva talks.Asked by the BBC whether he expects Russian and American officials to meet this week, Peskov replies “not yet” – though Moscow, he says, is “open to such contacts and talks”.The suspicion here in Moscow is that the updated version will not be as favourable to Russia. This morning the Russian tabloid Mosovsky Komsomolets wrote: “The European and Ukrainian gang will 'correct' Trump’s plan in such a way that it becomes completely unacceptable for Russia.”Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov says Ukrainians would \"fight to the end\" to save the Donbas territories from coming under Russian control.\"Maybe for the sake of saving lives there will be some sort of agreement, but I know the bitterness of that.\"\"It's burnt and it's my home,\" he adds. \"Ukraine is not only the land, Ukraine is a community or community of communities. So as long as that idea survives, Ukraine will survive.\"Here are some pictures of the aftermath in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, where four people have died after Russian attacks.\"Every night and every day are new challenges for our city, new destruction and new work for all services that have been continuously saving people,\" the city's Mayor Ihor Terekhov writes following the strikes.\"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" he writes in a social media post.Earlier today, Zelensky said a major issue was that Putin wanted \"legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty\" - a reference to Russia's repeated demand that Ukrainian troops withdraw from several embattled eastern regions.With this, Zelensky is making the point that allowing Russia to seize land by force would set a dangerous precedent.The US peace plan draft proposes to freeze the front line in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, giving Moscow control of huge areas of those regions. Perhaps more concerningly for Ukraine, it also says Kyiv should hand over the areas of the industrial eastern Donbas region still under Ukrainian control to the de facto control of Russia.Zelensky has repeatedly said that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future - not to mention the thousands of casualties Ukraine has suffered, and is still suffering, trying to protect the region.Following Volodymyr Zelensky's address to Sweden, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament says Ukraine will not accept legal recognition of the Russian-occupied territories, restrictions on Ukraine's forces, or limits on Ukraine's future alliances.He also tells the Swedish parliament that Ukraine's membership of the EU and Nato must be part of any peace plan.As we've reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been addressing the Swedish parliament.He says the \"main problem\" facing the peace talks is Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory he has \"stolen\" from Ukraine.\"This would break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" he tells the lawmakers, and insists that \"borders cannot be changed by force\".EU leaders are currently meeting African leaders in Angola, which may well reinforce the sense of them being far removed from the negotiations.President Macron of France warned over the weekend that Russia could invade Ukraine again if the Zelensky government is pushed into reducing the size of its military.Chancellor Merz of Germany said he had stressed to President Trump in a phone call the severe consequences for the whole of Europe if Ukraine were to collapse following defeat in the war.Ukraine is certainly hoping the personal relationships of certain European leaders with Trump will benefit them in a process that appears to have favoured Russia from the outset.Trump-whisperer and golf partner President Stubb of Finland has tweeted this morning about “major issues” needing to be resolved, and said he had been in touch with Zelensky.But he also had a message to the US and to the man with whom he has often strode down the fairway together – that EU and Nato members would take “a separate track” to discuss matters affecting them directly.The Kremlin says it hasn't received an updated peace plan following the weekend's talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva.Speaking this morning, Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov says Vladimir Putin's administration has been following the discussions and understands that \"some adjustments\" have been made to the peace plans Russia had previously received.We understand that the talks in Geneva are over after an intense day of diplomacy on Sunday, with all the key negotiators leaving town.Marco Rubio left last night and the Ukrainian delegation has also returned to Kyiv, according to Ukrainian state media who were covering the talks. The UK security adviser Jonathan Powell has now gone, diplomats here say.Yesterday, Marco Rubio made clear that the push for a peace proposal - a \"living, breathing document\" as he called it - was a process that had been in the works for three weeks prior to the high level talks, and would continue away from Geneva.The US idea was to get the big names round the same table on Sunday to try to “iron out” some issues and the US secretary of state said they had made “great strides”.He notes there's significant scepticism that this round of diplomacy will bring results - and there's also a lot of finger pointing at Kyiv and Europe.A former MI6 chief has praised this weekend’s peace talks as a “good approach”, but says the initial proposals were just Moscow talking points.If Ukraine had agreed to this straight away, Younger tells the Today programme, “the war would restart”.He says the idea that Ukraine’s army should be so limited it can’t defend itself is an “absolute non-starter”.Instead, Younger says the only security guarantee that matters is Ukraine having a powerful, well-equipped army able to defend itself - the “porcupine strategy”.He says this is \"a critical moment\", and Ukraine is working \"closely with the US and other European partners to define steps\" to end the war in Ukraine.\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty. That's the main problem. You all understand what that means,\" he says.Putin wants this \"not only from Ukraine, he wants it from the whole world, and it's very dangerous.\"Zelensky adds that during the talks so far, they've managed to keep \"very sensitive points\" on the table, including the release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of abducted Ukrainian children.\"Every European politician has a duty to support this plan fully and unconditionally, as this is the rational and humane choice,\" he says.Hungary has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has used Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas to maintain good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform to win re-election next April in Hungary by promising \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.Finland's president Alexander Stubb says he welcomes the progress made in the talks in Geneva, after speaking to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.\"The negotiations were a step forward, but there are still major issues which remain to be resolved,\" he adds.Stubb adds any decision falling within the remit of the EU or Nato will be discussed and decided by their members separately.",

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.Polish Trade Minister Michał Baranowski - in Brussels for crucial trade talks with European and American counterparts - was live in our studio commenting on the \"frank\" talks between the Americans and the Europeans about the fraught EU-US trade deal.\"Would I be happier if it was more balanced, if we got a bigger slice of the pie? Absolutely. But I think we'll be looking at both what has been signed and the bigger strategic picture\", he said.Last July, the EU signed up to an unbalanced deal on tariffs to stabilise relations with the US and ensure support for Ukraine, but it is uncertain whether the bet will pay off.Another major point on the desks of European ministers these days is the plan to use Russian frozen assets to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, but President Trump’s plan for Ukraine throws the reparations loan for Ukraine into disarray.\"It is clear who has to pay at the end. It is Russia, Russia is the aggressor. We happen as Europe to have the assets,\" Baranowski told Europe Today.Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the former president of Estonia also joined Europe Today to react the US-Russian plan for Ukraine.\"It's a fantastic win for the Kremlin, at least as it was originally proposed, and it's probably not the Trump plan, it is the Trump-Putin plan\", he said. \"It was clear that everything in that original document is in favour of Moscow and in every way against what Ukraine needs and they are the victim.\"Every morning at 8 am CET, you can join Euronews’ chief anchor Méabh Mc Mahon and our EU editor Maria Tadeo, who will bring you up to speed on the major news events of the day in our new daily show “Europe Today”.Broadcasting live from Brussels, our new format will bring you the day’s key events plus crucial analysis of all the stories shaping the EU and beyond.",

    "details": "The meeting in Cairo comes as Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the dozens of people killed in Israel’s latest attacks.A senior delegation from Hamas has met Egypt’s intelligence chief in Cairo to discuss Israel’s breaches of the ceasefire agreement, the group said, as Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for dozens of people killed in recent Israeli attacks.In a statement on Sunday, the group said it reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the first phase of the ceasefire agreement in its meeting with Hassan Rashad, but accused Israel of “continued violations” that it said threatened to “undermine the deal”.Hamas, whose delegation included its exiled Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya, called for a “clear and defined mechanism” under the supervision of mediators to document and halt any breaches of the deal.Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been mediating between Hamas and Israel, securing the ceasefire that came into effect last month.The Palestinian group said it also discussed with Egypt ways to urgently resolve the issue of Hamas fighters holed up in tunnel networks in Rafah in Israeli-controlled areas of Gaza.The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas members after the group sent a fighter into Israeli-controlled Gaza territory to attack Israeli soldiers there. The military said a local Hamas commander was among those killed in the Saturday strikes.Hamas has rejected the allegations, saying Israel was looking for an excuse to kill. The group on Saturday called on the mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the US – to intervene urgently and exert pressure on Israel to “immediately halt these violations”.Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians there fear an expansion of Israel’s attacks.“It’s very hard to tell that there’s a letup in terms of Israel’s attacks on Gaza. We are seeing continuous attacks beyond the ‘yellow line’, which are the areas under Israeli control. We are seeing demolition and systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and landmarks, and the turning of this area into a barren landscape,” Abu Azzoum said.“People here are concerned about the potential expansion of Israel’s attacks to other areas in Gaza in the coming days. People are also sceptical of the possibility of moving from phase one of the ceasefire to phase two as they are still waiting to see if the deal can be sustained and if there will be advancements in terms of the flow of humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts,” he added.Phase one of the ceasefire – based on US President Donald Trump’s peace plan – involves the exchange of captives and prisoners, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the opening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.Phase two of the ceasefire meanwhile calls for Gaza to be governed under a technocratic Palestinian committee, with oversight and supervision of the Trump-led “board of peace”. The board is to also deploy a temporary International Stabilisation Force to secure border areas, train Palestinian police and also demilitarise Gaza.Tump’s plan also says no Palestinian would be forced to leave Gaza and that “Israel will not occupy or annex” the territory.",

    "details": "Ukraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\".Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it.Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\".\"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"But staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.Aishat Baimuradova fled her home this year in the hope of living the way she wanted, but she was then found dead in her rented flat.US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.",

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.Top US and Ukrainian officials said they made progress on Sunday towards ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine following high-stakes talks in the Swiss city of Geneva.The talks were aimed at discussing US President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the embattled Ukraine, which sparked concern among many of Washington’s European allies, who viewed the plan as heavily conciliatory to Moscow.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the US delegation in Geneva, said the talks were “very worthwhile” and constituted the most productive days in a “very long time”.The top US diplomat however offered few details about what the breakthrough with his Ukrainian counterpart looked like, noting that higher-level officials will likely have to get involved soon and continue discussions on Monday and beyond.He also downplayed the Thursday deadline set by Trump for Kyiv to respond to his proposal, stressing that officials want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible.“This is a very delicate moment,” said Rubio. “Some of it is semantics, or language. Others require higher-level decisions and consultations. Others, I think, just need more time to work through.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the US support it so desperately relies on. Zelenskyy also asserted that Ukrainians “will always defend” their home.The proposal accommodates many Russian demands that Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including ceding large territories.In a statement released on Sunday night after the talks, the White House said the Ukrainian delegation “affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting.”It added that Kyiv “expressed appreciation for the structured approach taken to incorporate their feedback into each component of the emerging settlement framework.” The White House said changes made to the proposal now reflect “their national interests\" and provide \"credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine’s security in both the near and long term.”But the language of such positive steps came only after concerns about the original, Trump-endorsed deal intensified.A bipartisan group of US senators said Rubio told them Saturday that the plan had originated with Russia and was actually a “wish list” for Moscow, rather than a serious push for peace.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he’d spoken to Trump and made clear there were some parts of the plans key European nations could agree on, but others where they could not.“I told him that we are fully in line with Ukraine, that the sovereignty of this country must not be jeopardised,” Merz said in an interview with a German media outlet.Rubio called the US proposal a “living breathing document” that would continue changing. He also made clear that any final product, once it’s ready, will still have to be presented to Moscow; “obviously, the Russians get a vote here.”The positive assessment of what was discussed defied Trump himself. Before talks began, the president blasted Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for US military assistance while shying away from criticising Russia.“Ukraine 'leadership' has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts, and Europe cotinues to by oil from Russia,” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social, on Sunday morning.After Trump’s post, Zelenskyy cheered US-led efforts on security while also stressing that “the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.”“Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on Telegram, adding, “We thank everyone in Europe.”“It is important not to forget the main goal – to stop Russia’s war and prevent it from ever igniting again,” he added.",

EU partners on Saturday in South Africa reviewed the peace plan proposed by Washington, while leaders continued negotiations in Geneva on Sunday.",

The EU executive is proposing to boost the use of crops and trees for biofuel production in a bid to slash GHG emissions.First-generation biofuels are derived from food crops like corn and sugarcane, second-generation biofuels are derived from inedible vegetation and agricultural waste, and third-generation biofuels are derived from algae.A recent trade deal on agriculture signed between the EU and Ukraine could fulfil the bloc's demand for biofuels.The new deal includes safeguards limiting imports of certain sensitive products such as grains and oil. If these are lifted, Ukraine could end up playing a key role in the supply chain.\"The EU’s bioeconomy is a dynamic driver for competitiveness and is of strategic importance,\" read the document.However, international competition, notably from the United States and China, and persistent barriers in the single market are slowing deployment and risk diverting innovation to non-EU markets, according to the document.",

What are different European countries prioritising in space?The new plan, unveiled in November, covers spaceflight projects, the expansion of satellite networks and international collaborations so the country can become “more capable of action” in space, a government statement reads.“Space systems have become an integral part of our lives … their failure or disruption would have serious consequences for our security and everyday lives,” defence minister Boris Pistorius said in a statement.President Emmanuel Macron announced in November that France’s new space strategy will marry scientific research and security.The French plan has five main goals: maintaining competitive access to space, building a space economy, retaining a space military architecture, investing in research, and fostering international cooperation.Among the goals listed in the plan is to modernise the space centre in French Guiana, where the Ariane 6 launcher will eventually pilot commercial flights.Macron said that the plan matches competition in space, which is building in space, such as energy arms and lasers.One of the weapons that France could invest in is patrol-seeking satellites called Orbit Guard and Toutatis that will be able to protect the country’s assets in orbit.The plan will also strengthen military capabilities in intelligence, early warning systems and communications.The recent plan builds on France’s Military Programming Act, which promised to build systems that could detect suspicious or aggressive acts in space.The country has also launched Space Pact, a group to facilitate conversations between the military and space industry players. ​While it is currently being developed, the government said it will be a “multi-domain” plan that will help Italy respond to possible threats that could occur in the next two decades.The plan will eventually identify “short-term capabilities [and] fill operational gaps,” in its defence.The country is working with Germany and France on the development of several European launchers, including the Ariane 6 and its smaller sister, Vega-C.The UK Space Agency’s plan, released in September, will use space to strengthen the country’s economy, increase security and continue to unlock “global discoveries that inspire millions”.The country will invest in small-launch capabilities such as launch vehicles, eco-friendly spaceports and developing niches in satellite communications.There is also a push from the UK to build the right capacities to repair, upgrade or assemble satellites while in orbit.The UK’s Space Agency says it will achieve its plans by building inclusive workplaces that attract and keep talent, making more investments in science and innovation fields and through international partnerships.The strategy is based on four pillars: autonomy in space, developing a “robust portfolio” of space assets to support national defence, collective security and developing the relevant knowledge for defence projects.To do this, the strategy said the state will expand collaboration between government agencies, private companies in the space sector, and potentially adapt space legislation.The defence policy says that Sweden’s location near the North Pole makes it an ideal place to operate, monitor and launch polar satellites in particular.Sweden’s strategy said it is building launch capabilities for the Esrange spaceport, a launch site in the north. Firefly Aerospace will launch satellites from the station next year, according to the Swedish Space Corporation.Space is one of the key areas identified by the Netherlands in its Dutch Defence Strategyfor the end of the decade.At the same time, the military is aiming to access a European early warning system to help with air and missile defence.The country said it would build up six capacities: space situational awareness (SSA), reconnaissance, satellite communications, positioning/navigation/timing, shared early warning, and monitoring space weather.",

    "details": "A three-year-old boy has astounded doctors with his progress after becoming the first person in the world with his devastating disease to receive a ground-breaking gene therapy.Oliver Chu has a rare, inherited condition called Hunter syndrome - or MPSII - which causes progressive damage to the body and brain.Due to a faulty gene, before the treatment Oliver was unable to produce an enzyme crucial for keeping cells healthy.In a world first, medical staff in Manchester have tried to halt the disease by altering Oliver's cells using gene therapy.At the centre of this remarkable story is Oliver - the first of five boys around the world to receive the treatment - and the Chu family, from California, who have put their faith in the medical team at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.The BBC has followed Oliver's story for more than a year - including how scientists in the UK first developed the pioneering gene therapy and how the medical trial they are conducting almost didn't get off the ground due to lack of funds.Since being diagnosed with Hunter syndrome in April,  Oliver's life - like that of his elder brother, Skyler, who also has the condition - has been dominated by hospital visits.Skyler had shown some late development in speech and coordination, but this had initially been put down to being born during Covid.\"When you find out about Hunter syndrome, the first thing the doctor tells you is 'Don't go on the internet and look it up because you'll find the worst cases and you'll be very, very disheartened'.\"\"But, like anybody, you look it up and you're like, 'Oh my goodness, is this what's going to happen to both my sons?'\"Children are born apparently healthy, but around the age of two they start to show symptoms of the disease.These vary and can include changes to physical features, stiffness of the limbs and short stature.  It can cause damage throughout the body, including to the heart, liver, bones and joints and in the most serious cases can lead to severe mental impairment and progressive neurological decline.But today, Oliver is being hooked up to a machine and having some of his cells removed - the first crucial step in trying to halt his genetic disorder in this one-off treatment.\"His blood is being passed through a fancy machine that is collecting a specific type of cell called stem cells which will be sent to a lab to be modified and then given back to him,\" Dr Claire Horgan, consultant paediatric haematologist explains.Oliver's cells are carefully packaged and sent to a laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London.Scientists insert the missing IDS gene into a virus, which has its genetic material removed so that it can't cause disease.A similar method has been used in other gene therapies, such as the treatment for another rare inherited condition, MLD.Dr Karen Buckland, from the Cell and Gene Therapy Service at GOSH, explains: \"We use the machinery from the virus to insert a working copy of the faulty gene into each of the stem cells.\"When those go back to Oliver, they should repopulate his bone marrow and start to produce new white blood cells and each of these will hopefully start to produce the missing protein [enzyme] in his body.\"To overcome this, the inserted gene is modified so that the enzyme it produces crosses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently.There is a sense of anticipation as a member of the research team opens a large metal cryopreservation tank where Oliver's gene edited stem cells are frozen, having been transported back from GOSH.Oliver is used to hospitals, but is fretful, and wriggles as the research nurse slowly injects the treatment, about a cup full, into a catheter in his chest.An hour later, a second, identical infusion is made. Oliver continues to watch cartoons on a portable screen, oblivious to the potential importance of what's just happened.And that's it. The gene therapy is complete. It seems to be all over rather quickly, yet the ambition here is huge: to stop Oliver's progressive disease in its tracks, in a one-off treatment.After a couple of days, Oliver and Jingru fly back to California. Now the family, and the medical team must wait to see if the gene therapy has worked.In May, Oliver is back in Manchester for crucial tests to see if the gene therapy is working. This time the whole family is here.Oliver is more mobile and inquisitive than I've seen him. Admittedly, he now has the freedom to play and is out of hospital, but he appears brighter and healthier.Ricky is thrilled: \"He's doing really well. We have seen him progressing in his speech, and mobility. In just three months he has matured.\"The really big news is that Oliver has been able to come off the weekly infusion of the missing enzyme.\"I want to pinch myself every time I tell people that Oliver is making his own enzymes,\" says Jingru. \"Every time we talk about it I want to cry because it's just so amazing.\"She tells me he is \"so different\" from before the treatment, is talking \"a ton\" and is engaging more with other children.It is lovely to finally meet five-year-old Skyler who is very protective and caring towards his younger brother.\"My wish upon the star is for Skyler, to be able to get the same treatment,\" says Ricky. \"It feels like Oliver has got a reset in his life, and I want the same thing for Skyler, even though he's a bit older.\"Initially it was thought that Oliver was too old for the trial, as the treatment cannot reverse existing damage, but tests showed he was still largely unaffected.Skyler seems to take delight in the world around him, and is keen to hold my hand and chat as we walk to the park.Ricky explains that Skyler has delayed development in speech and motor skills, but is undergoing infusion therapy, which gets the treatment to his body, but not his brain.Prof Jones, whom Oliver calls Santa because of his white beard, is beaming: \"Before the transplant Ollie didn't make any enzyme at all and now he's making hundreds of times the normal amount.\"But more importantly, we can see he's improving, he's learning, he's got new words and new skills and he's moving around much more easily.\"However, Prof Jones exercises a degree of caution: \"We need to be careful and not get carried away in the excitement of all this, but things are as good as they could be at this point in time.\"\"He's like a completely different child. He's running around everywhere, he won't stop talking,\" says Ricky.In all, five boys have been signed up for the trial, from the US, Europe and Australia.  None are from the UK as patients here were diagnosed too late to qualify.All the boys will be monitored for at least two years. If the trial is deemed a success, the hospital and university hope to partner with another biotech firm in order to get the treatment licensed.Ricky and Jingru say they are \"eternally grateful\" to the Manchester team for allowing Oliver to join the trial.\"His life is no longer dominated by needles and hospital visits. His speech, agility and cognitive development have all got dramatically better.\"It's not just a slow, gradual curve as he gets older, it has shot up exponentially since the transplant.\"But three years later the company handed back the licence to the university, following poor results from another gene therapy study and a lack of funds.Prof Jones: \"We had to move very quickly to try to save the whole idea and find another sponsor and another source of funding.\"The Chu family are relieved the trial didn't come to a halt and now hope Skyler may one day benefit from the same gene therapy as his brother.\"I would walk to the end of the earth, backwards, forwards, upside down, barefoot, to make sure my kids have a better future,\" says Ricky.Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.Toddler Oliver and his dad Ricky join Jon and Sally on the Breakfast sofa, to discuss his progress after his ground-breaking gene therapy.Much like our other organs, our skin begins to age from the moment we are born.

Today's attack in the southern suburbs opens the door to an escalation of attacks across Lebanon,\" said Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chairman of Hezbollah's political council, speaking from the scene.Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned Sunday's attack and accused Israel of refusing to implement the ceasefire agreement. He called on the international community to \"intervene forcefully and seriously to stop the attacks against Lebanon and its people.\"The Israeli military said he \"commanded most of Hezbollah's units and worked hard to bring them back to readiness for war with Israel.\"",

    "details": "Hezbollah says Tabatabai was a member since group’s foundation and held several senior military roles.Israel has attacked the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Lebanon’s capital, Beirut, killing five people, including Hezbollah’s highest ranking military official.Sunday’s attack, which took place amid an uptick in Israeli attacks across Lebanon, was the first on Beirut’s southern suburbs in several months and the first without warning since last year’s ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced.Israel has since been accused of violating that ceasefire on a near-daily basis by United Nations experts. Hezbollah has responded to Israel’s continued attacks once, in December.Before the attack, Tabatabai’s name was not widely known in Lebanon. Hezbollah’s military operatives tend to work in the shadows to avoid Israeli assassinations.But since his death on Sunday, it has been revealed that Tabatabai held many senior positions within the armed political group during his tenure.Later, he was responsible for Hezbollah’s operations along the border with Syria and took over responsibilities for the operations branch during last year’s war with Israel.According to Israeli media reports, Tabatabai led Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force in Syria and Yemen before replacing Ali Karaki, who was assassinated during last year’s war, as commander of Hezbollah’s southern front.He was appointed as Hezbollah’s chief of staff after the war, in which most of Hezbollah’s senior military leaders were killed by Israel.“Tabatabai was the one reorganising Hezbollah’s military leadership, and the targeting of the southern suburbs of Beirut is an indication that the Lebanese state has no guarantees against the expansion of such attacks,” Sohaib Jawhar, a nonresident fellow at the Beirut-based Badil, the Alternative Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.In its statement, Hezbollah confirmed the loss of “the great martyr jihadist commander” known as Sayyid Abu Ali and described Israel’s assassination as a “treacherous attack on the Haret Hreik area in the suburbs of Beirut”.Mahmoud Qmati, vice president of the group’s Political Council, lamented “yet another ceasefire violation” and accused Israel of escalating the conflict “with the green light given by the United States”.It also confirmed the deaths of four other Hezbollah members: Qassem Hussein Berjawi, Rifaat Ahmad Hussein, Mostafa Asaad Berro and Ibrahim Ali Hussein.“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty and the security of its citizens,” he said.Just two days before the attack, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun announced the government’s intention to enter peace negotiations with Israel with support from the international community.After the attack on Sunday, however, Aoun called on the international community to intervene to stop Israeli attacks on his country.Frustration has been building in parts of Lebanon as some locals feel the government is not properly equipped or willing to respond to Israel’s repeated aggressions. Many residents in southern Lebanon have expressed feelings of abandonment by the Lebanese government because it has been unable to prevent repeated Israeli attacks or rebuild destroyed homes.After Sunday’s strike, Israel said it “remains committed to the understandings agreed upon between the State of Israel and Lebanon”, likely referring to the existing ceasefire.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had been ordered after recommendations from the defence minister and the Israeli army’s chief of staff, and he justified it by accusing Tabatabai of posing a threat to Israeli security.The Israeli army released a statement, saying: “Tabatabai commanded most of Hezbollah’s units and worked extensively to restore their readiness for war with Israel. The [Israeli military] will act against attempts to rebuild and rearm Hezbollah and will operate forcefully to remove any threat against Israel.”According to the US news website Axios, US officials were aware that an “escalation” was expected but were not informed of the details of this particular strike. An official told Axios the US had been informed by Israel’s government directly after the strike.Qmati said Israel’s strike had crossed a “red line” and the group’s leadership would now consider whether a response was warranted.“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.",

While they expected security officers to be deployed in the village in the wake of the attack on St Mary's School, this has not yet happened.President Tinubu's office said on Sunday that all police in Very Important Persons (VIP) protection services had been redeployed to focus on core duties, especially in remote areas prone to attacks.VIPs in need of protection will now be able to request armed personnel from the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).According to a Christian group involved in the case, the pupils managed to escape between Friday and Saturday in what is being described as a brave and risky attempt to flee their captors.Niger state governor Mohammed Umaru Bongo announced on Saturday that all schools in the area would close, warning that was \"not a time for blame game\".Calling for the release of the abductees, Pope Leo XIV expressed \"immense sadness\" and urged the authorities to act swiftly.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... It took everybody by surprise.\"The military, police and local vigilantes are conducting a search for the children, combing nearby forests and remote routes believed to have been used by the gunmen.Authorities in Niger state said St Mary's School had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks. The school has not commented on that allegation.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but it has had little effect.Last week's attacks follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians. The Nigerian government has dismissed this claim.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority-Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The incident drew international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.BBC Africa Eye uncovers two so-called \"juju\" practitioners, who offer to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there is a \"renewed commitment to multilateral co-operation\".",

That path begins with reconstruction, deeper integration into the EU's single market and defence industrial base, and ultimately full membership, she said.The Commission president emphasised the importance of the bloc's work and unity with Kyiv, \"the Coalition of the Willing and the US\" in moving towards peace.Von der Leyen highlighted the abducted Ukrainian children as \"a crucial element that must be part of any agreement\" and a matter \"personally important to me.\"\"Tens of thousands of boys and girls remain trapped in Russia. Frightened and longing for their loved ones. We must place these children at the top of the global agenda,\" she said.The president announced that the EU, Ukraine and Canada will host a summit of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children.On Saturday, Ukraine's Western allies rallied in a show of support as they worked to revise the US peace plan they believe leans too heavily in Moscow's favour.On Sunday, European officials and national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK participated in talks in Geneva.",

He said power supply was not disrupted because it was switched to “backup lines”.We're interested in investigating claims you may've seen online in your social feeds. We're also keen to know if you've think an image may have been made using artificial intelligence to spread disinformation.You can also get in touch with BBC Verify if you've got a question about how we verify video posted online or work with satellite imagery.We’ve been looking at social media posts emerging overnight of emergency services dealing with the aftermath of deadly overnight Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine.Kharkiv’s mayor Ihor Terekhov reports in a Telegram post that four people have been killed in a strike on residential buildings.In one video shared on Telegram, we see Terekhov offering his coat to an elderly resident of a building that was hit.We’ve also been looking at footage of an explosion lighting up the sky from a distance. We were able to verify the location of the person filming by matching the distinctive St Panteleimon Church and other nearby landmarks to images online.The strikes come after talks over a Washington-backed peace plan were held between Ukraine and the US in Switzerland over the weekend.Over the weekend, X rolled out a new feature which allows users to to see the country or region where the social media platform believes an account is based.According to X’s head of product Nikita Bier, official government accounts will not have their locations revealed “to, external prevent acts of terrorism against government leaders”, external.The feature, called “about this account”, can be accessed from any user’s bio and identifies the country or region through which they often connect to X.X has clarified that the data about where an account is based can be impacted by recent travel or temporary relocation, so the information may not be accurate and can change from time to time. The use of virtual private networks (VPN) which allow users to change the location they are accessing the internet through might also distort the data.X will add a new update to the feature today, which Bier has said will have a 99% accuracy, external.The new data has led to praise from many X users, who say the feature has provided much needed transparency about accounts which deliberately mislead users for engagement or political reasons. But it’s also caused some concern about revealing users’ private information.Over the weekend the social media platform X began sharing which region users’ access their accounts from. The firm, which is owned by Elon Musk, says it’s done this in the interests of “transparency”. We’re looking into what this means in terms of tackling disinformation.Elsewhere our verification team is checking out footage being shared from Ukraine where a Russian strike overnight is reported to have killed at least four people in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.After the Israeli military killed a top Hezbollah official in an air strike yesterday, we’ll explain how we verified videos of the scene and the aftermath.As ever BBC Verify is keen to hear from you if you’ve seen material being shared online that appears to be misleading or questionable - you can get in touch with us here.",

    "details": "Thea Jaffe never expected to use a baby bank. In fact, she was responsible for referring other single parents from her local community group to the charity Little Village, which provides essential supplies for new parents who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford them – everything from strollers and cots to clothes, diapers, toys and books.But when Jaffe, who lives in London, became pregnant unexpectedly with her second child, she couldn’t afford to buy everything she needed. “It’s so overwhelming having to accommodate a baby with no budget,” she told CNN.“I was already struggling financially… but I didn’t know how bad things were going to get… Now things are at a point where I’m working full time, and I cannot pay my bills.”Child poverty has reached a record high in the United Kingdom as the country’s cost of living soars and its social security safety net falters following years of government austerity. With public services much weakened, charities like Little Village have stepped in.The issue is firmly under the spotlight this week as campaign groups call on Britain’s Labour government to prioritize measures to reduce child poverty in its annual budget, which will be unveiled on Wednesday.“We came across one family that were just existing on cornflakes and rice,” Little Village chief executive Sophie Livingstone told CNN.“We have lots of families who are in one room, lots of mold, lots of very poor-quality housing even when people are housed,” she added.Even for families that are able to meet their children’s basic needs, life is a month-to-month struggle, without any financial security.“You just live in fear all the time and that’s not a fun place to be when you’ve got children relying on you,” Lia, a single mother to 7-year-old twin girls, told CNN after being connected through the Changing Realities Project, which documents parents living on low incomes. She asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family’s privacy.“They want to do all the same things that their peers are doing… but the budget won’t allow that,” she said. After paying for essentials each month, she has no money left.“Every single time I go out, I have to vigilantly and diligently make sure I’m not overspending. That’s a really anxiety-provoking situation to be in.”A law graduate who lives in Hampshire, southeast England, Lia initially returned to work but says she would often be called mid-meeting by her childcare provider if one of her daughters, who has complex needs, dyspraxia and global developmental delay, was having a “tantrum or a meltdown.” She eventually had to quit her job.“I go into survival mode,” she said. “I was in the (foster) care system growing up and I remember feeling so much struggle and angst like, ‘if I can just get through this, it’ll be ok.’ Yet still, that situation hasn’t changed; as much as I know I have a lot to offer and I try to be a good member of society, I still feel like no matter where I turn, there’s difficulty.”Part of this rise is down to the same economic conditions afflicting other parts of the Western world – sluggish growth, and employment no longer offering the same financial security, as well as stubborn inflation that disproportionately affects essential goods and, therefore, people on low incomes.Charities and academics say it is this two-child benefit cap in particular that is largely responsible for Britain’s rising rates of child poverty.All this demonstrates the “inadequacy of the benefits system,” says Peter Matejic, chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.“If you tot up how much you need for food, energy, all these things, and look at how much (benefits are)… it’s below that level,” he told CNN.A spokesperson for the current Labour government, which has been in power since July last year, told CNN that “every child, no matter their background, deserves the best start in life.”Addressing child poverty has been a stated priority for the center-left government and, at the same time, an issue that illuminates the fault lines within it.Ever since Labour came to power, it has grappled with balancing the mandate for change on which it was elected, and its traditional inclination to invest in public services, with scant available funds and a manifesto pledge not to increase taxes on working people.Its plans to reduce child poverty have thus far been stymied by this conundrum. More details of the government’s spending and tax plans are due to be unveiled Wednesday, in which Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the UK’s finance minister, is expected to address the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government has oscillated between keeping and scrapping for the past year.But for parents already on the breadline, their household budgets have been stretched too thin, for too long.“People have got no resilience left,” says Livingstone, remembering that when she first began her role as the head of Little Village “we were talking about the safety net having lots of holes in it.”",

He added that police are still investigating to determine the identity and nationality of the attackers, without giving further details.Zulfiqar Hameed, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told the AFP news agency that “the attack has concluded, and a clearance operation is under way to determine whether any unexploded ordnance is present.”The attack took place at the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment, a garrison area under the administrative control of the Pakistan Army.Three paramilitary personnel were killed in the attack, Javed Iqbal, who is the deputy commandant of the force, said.However, the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, have been blamed for similar assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in such attacks in recent months.There is still no clarity on the total number of attackers. AP reported that there were two suicide bombers, without mentioning the total number of people involved in the attack, while AFP said there was a bomber among the assailants. Reuters reported that there were three suicide bombers.Two of the attackers were killed by security forces, while the third assailant detonated explosives, AFP reported.“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate, while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Peshawar police chief Ahmad told reporters, according to local outlet Dawn.Ahmad told reporters that one attacker was killed while detonating the suicide bomb explosives, and the other two were injured and taken to hospital.President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemns the attack on the Federal Constabulary HQ in Peshawar, offering heartfelt condolences & praising the courage of security forces. He affirms that externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack in a statement, saying the sacrifices of the personnel who were killed in the attack will be remembered, Dawn reported.Senator Sherry Rehman from the Pakistan Peoples Party wrote in an X post: “No such #terrorist plots or attackers backed by external sources, which it seems they were, can or will weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve.”Strongly condemn the attack on the Federal Constabulary HQ in Peshawar. Heartfelt condolences to the families of the FC martyrs.

And here's the extraordinary bit: it had never been opened or disturbed since it was first sealed all those centuries ago.\"The peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact,\" said Gabriella Fényes, the excavation's lead archaeologist.All the objects were \"items given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey,\" Fényes explained.\"The deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives. They must have really loved who they buried here,\" she said.Anthropologists will now examine the young woman's remains to learn more about her age, health, and origins. But the grave's location and the abundance of artefacts already tell us quite a bit about who she might have been.The sarcophagus and its contents \"definitely make it stand out,\" said Gergely Kostyál, a Roman-period specialist and co-leader of the project. \"This probably means that the deceased was well-to-do or of a higher social status.\"\"It is truly rare to find a sarcophagus like this, untouched and never used before, because in the fourth century it was common to reuse earlier sarcophagi,\" he added. \"It is quite clear that this sarcophagus was made specifically for the deceased.\"The excavation team also removed a layer of mud roughly four centimetres thick from inside the coffin, which Fényes hopes might contain even more treasures.\"I suspect we could find jewellery. We haven't found any earrings or other jewellery belonging to the woman, so I hope that these small items will turn up during the sifting of the mud,\" she said.\"I was very touched by the care and expression of love that we were able to get a glimpse of,\" she said. \"Even now, I shudder to think how painful it must have been for the people at that time to bury this young lady.\"",

Advocates of assisted dying said they were disappointed but expressed conviction a new legislation will be passed in the future.Prime Minister Robert Golob said in a press release that while the current bill was rejected the “challenge we are addressing still remains”.“This is not a political issue, it has always been a matter of dignity, human rights, and individual choice,” he added.The law envisaged that mentally competent people who have no chance of recovery or are facing unbearable pain have the right to assisted dying. This meant that patients would administer the lethal medication themselves after approval from two doctors and a period of consultation.Backers, including Golob's liberal government, have argued that the law gives people a chance to die with dignity and decide for themselves how and when to end their suffering.Opponents included conservative groups, some doctors' associations, and the Catholic church. They insisted that the law went against Slovenia's constitution and that the state should work to provide better palliative care instead.President Nataša Pirc Musar said upon voting on Sunday that it is “extremely important” for the citizens to go to the polls and “not only when there are parliamentary or presidential elections”.“It is right for us as individuals to say what we think about a certain topic,” she said. “It is right for us to tell politicians what we think is right and what we think is wrong”.Several other EU countries have already passed similar laws, including Slovenia's neighbour, Austria.",

He has stepped down from his post but strongly denied any wrongdoing.Experts say island nations like the Philippines are facing increasingly severe and frequent tropical storms due to warming oceans and other effects of climate change, and that more flood control efforts are needed to minimise the potential consequences.",

Marcos warned that anybody helping the fugitives to hide would also be held accountable under the law.",

It doesn’t, however, explicitly authorize the use of lethal force, according to legal experts.Still, administration officials have been making the case that the designation — one of the State Department’s most serious counterterrorism tools — will give the US expanded military options for striking inside Venezuela.Cartel de los Soles is used to describe a decentralized network of Venezuelan groups within the armed forces linked to drug trafficking, experts say. The Venezuelan president has always denied any personal involvement in drug trafficking, and his government has repeatedly denied the existence of the alleged cartel, which some experts suggest technically doesn’t exist in a conventional sense.Trump has been briefed by top officials on a range of options for action inside Venezuela, including strikes on military or government facilities and special operations raids. The option of doing nothing also still exists.Officially, the Trump administration says it is working to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — but regime change is a possible side effect of those efforts. Trump is hoping that the pressure is enough to force Maduro to step down without taking direct military action, according to a US official.Trump has expressed some openness to a diplomatic resolution, saying last week that Maduro “would like to talk” and later suggesting that he would be open to speaking with him “at a certain time.”The White House did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the status of a potential Trump-Maduro conversation.And over the weekend, three international airlines canceled their flights departing from Venezuela after the US Federal Aviation Administration warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over the country, according to Reuters.",

The discussions showed meaningful progress toward aligning positions and identifying clear next steps,” officials said in a joint statement following talks in Geneva, adding that the sides agreed on the need for a “sustainable and just peace”.Washington and Kyiv also reiterated their readiness to keep working together to “secure a peace that ensures Ukraine’s security, stability, and reconstruction”, the joint statement said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier on Sunday said the sides had made “tremendous” progress during the talks, though their joint statement offered no specifics for resolving the many thorny points of contention between Moscow and Kyiv.“I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today. I honestly believe we’ll get there,” Rubio told reporters at the US mission in Geneva.Rubio declined to go into specifics about the amendments to the draft proposal, including whether Kyiv had agreed to compromise on key Russian demands, such as territorial concessions.“But I can tell you, I guess, that I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here because we made a tremendous amount of progress today,” Rubio said.“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA,” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social.Shortly after Trump’s comments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X that he was grateful to the US and “personally to President Trump” for Washington’s assistance in repelling Moscow’s invasion.Trump’s leaked blueprint for ending the war has caused consternation in Kyiv and European capitals due to its alignment with many of Moscow’s demands, including that Ukraine limit the size of its military and give up Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk.Zelenskyy said in a sombre national address last week that the plan put Ukraine in the position of having to choose between “losing dignity” or “losing a key partner”.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that any peace plan needed to respect Ukraine’s freedom to “choose its own destiny,” including to join the bloc.“It starts with the country’s reconstruction, its integration into our Single Market and our defence industrial base, and ultimately, joining our Union,” von der Leyen said in a statement.Asked whether a deal could be reached by Trump’s Thursday deadline, Rubio said “we want to get this done as soon as possible”.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Trump’s plan could form the basis for a final peace settlement, but warned that Moscow would advance further into Ukrainian territory if Kyiv refused to negotiate.",

    "details": "As tech firms race to release new AI tools, users are left unsure how much of their personal data these systems may take.Leading tech companies are in a race to release and improve artificial intelligence (AI) products, leaving users in the United States to puzzle out how much of their personal data could be extracted to train AI tools.Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp), Google and LinkedIn have all rolled out AI app features that have the capacity to draw on users’ public profiles or emails. Google and LinkedIn offer users ways to opt out of the AI features, while Meta’s AI tool provides no means for its users to say “no, thanks.”Posts warned that the platforms’ AI tool rollouts make most private information available for tech company harvesting. “Every conversation, every photo, every voice message, fed into AI and used for profit,” a November 9 X video about Meta said.Technology companies are rarely fully transparent when it comes to the user data they collect and what they use it for, Krystyna Sikora, a research analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, told PolitiFact.“Unsurprisingly, this lack of transparency can create significant confusion that in turn can lead to fear mongering and the spread of false information about what is and is not permissible,” Sikora said.The best – if tedious – way for people to know and protect their privacy rights is to read the terms and conditions, since it often explicitly outlines how the data will be used and whether it will be shared with third parties, Sikora said. The US doesn’t have any comprehensive federal laws on data privacy for technology companies.For example, if a user interacts with Meta’s AI chatbot about hiking, Meta might start showing that person recommendations for hiking groups or hiking boots.But that doesn’t mean your data isn’t being used for AI purposes. Although Meta doesn’t use people’s private messages in Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger to train its AI, it does collect user content that is set to “public” mode. This can include photos, posts, comments and reels. If the user’s Meta AI conversations involve religious views, sexual orientation and racial or ethnic origin, Meta says the system is designed to avoid parlaying these interactions into ads. If users ask questions of Meta AI using its voice feature, Meta says the AI tool will use the microphone only when users give permission.There is a caveat: The tech company says its AI might use information about people who don’t have Meta product accounts if their information appears in other users’ public posts. For example, if a Meta user mentions a non-user in a public image caption, that photo and caption could be used to train Meta AI.Can you opt out? No. If you are using Meta platforms in these ways – making some of your posts public and using the chatbot – your data could be used by Meta AI. There is no way to deactivate Meta AI in Instagram, Facebook or Threads. WhatsApp users can deactivate the option to talk with Meta AI in their chats, but this option is available only per chat, meaning that you must deactivate the option in each chat’s advanced privacy settings.The X post inaccurately advised people to submit this form to opt out. But the form is simply a way for users to report when Meta’s AI supplies an answer that contains someone’s personal information.David Evan Harris, who teaches AI ethics at the University of California, Berkeley, told PolitiFact that because the US has no federal regulations about privacy and AI training, people have no standardised legal right to opt out of AI training in the way that people in countries such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom and South Korea do.Even when social media platforms provide opt-out options for US customers, it’s often difficult to find the settings to do so, Harris said.Deleting your Meta accounts does not eliminate the possibility of Meta AI using your past public data, Meta’s spokesperson said.The facts: Google has a host of products that interact with private data in different ways. Google announced on November 5 that its AI product, Gemini Deep Research, can connect to users’ other Google products, including Gmail, Drive and Chat. But, as Forbes reported, users must first give permission to employ the tool.Users who want to allow Gemini Deep Research to have access to private information across products can choose what data sources to employ, including Google search, Gmail, Drive and Google Chat.Google can also access people’s data when they have smart features activated in their Gmail and Google Workplace settings (that are automatically on in the US), which gives Google consent to draw on email content and user activity data to help users compose emails or suggest Google Calendar events. With optional paid subscriptions, users can access additional AI features, including in-app Gemini summaries.Turning off Gmail’s smart features can stop Google’s AI from accessing Gmail, but it doesn’t stop Google’s access to the Gemini app, which users can either download or access in a browser.Can you opt out? If people don’t want their conversations used to train Google AI, they can use “temporary” chats or chat without signing into their Gemini accounts. Doing that means Gemini can’t save a person’s chat history, a Google spokesperson said. Otherwise, opting out of having Google’s AI in Gmail, Drive and Meet requires turning off smart features in settings.The data the AI collects includes details from people’s profiles and public content that users post.Can you opt out? Yes. Autumn Cobb, a LinkedIn spokesperson, confirmed to PolitiFact that members can opt out if they don’t want their content used for AI training purposes. They can also opt out of receiving targeted, personalised ads.To remove your data from being used for training purposes, go to data privacy, click on the option that says “Data for Generative AI Improvement” and then turn off the feature that says “use my data for training content creation AI models.”And to opt out of personalised ads, go to advertising data in settings, and turn off ads on LinkedIn and the option that says “data sharing with our affiliates and select partners”.",

Those discussions continue on a technical level today and EU leaders are also meeting for further talks.• Meanwhile, the Kremlin says it has not yet received any official information on the outcome of yesterday’s talks. They were praised by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as “substantive.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has just been speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal EU meeting.She says the talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday established a “solid basis for moving forward” in peace negotiations.Coordination between European countries and a “strong European presence” at the talks “has allowed us to make good progress in the negotiations for just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” von der Leyen said.“While work remains to be done. There is now a solid basis for moving forward,” she added, urging countries to “remain united” and “keep placing Ukraine’s best interests at the center of our efforts.”“This is about the security of our entire continent, now and in (the) future,” von der Leyen said. “Today’s meeting in Luanda reaffirmed that we are united in our support of Ukraine. These are our core European principles moving forward,” she added, stressing that Ukraine’s “territory and sovereignty must be respected.”Tens of thousands of homes across Ukraine were without power this morning, after overnight Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country.For context: Read our analysis here on how Russian forces are exploiting their manpower advantage to edge forward in multiple parts of Ukraine.Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid are a regular occurrence. Since late September, strikes on key power infrastructure have taken place almost daily, depriving Ukrainians of energy and heat ahead of the bitter winter months.Emergency repair work is continuing “wherever security conditions allow,” Ukrenergo said in its statement today. “Energy companies are doing everything possible to restore the equipment damaged by the enemy as quickly as possible.”The United Kingdom, France and Germany had drafted a counter-proposal to the US plan with an array of key changes, Reuters has reported. A European official and a European diplomatic source confirmed the text’s accuracy to CNN’s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was striking out the language regarding the restriction of further NATO expansion. According to the draft text obtained by Reuters, the European plan states:The European version also removed references to territorial concessions and the US proposal’s recognition of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk as de facto Russian territory.As we’ve reported, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that discussions on a plan to end the war in Ukraine would continue on a technical level today, as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also praised the “substantive” results from yesterday’s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.From Kharkiv region in the north to the farmland of Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces in Ukraine are edging forward, exploiting gaps in Ukrainian defenses and a vast numerical superiority.“Ukraine may now be approaching the point when the country no longer has enough fighters to effectively defend the full length of the front lines,” according to one analysis.Ukraine may be able to step up its deep strikes against Russian energy and military infrastructure. But the Kremlin will see no reason to make concessions at the negotiating table while its troops are on the front-foot.US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, a day after intensive talks were held between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”After a day of intensive talks in Geneva on Sunday, however, US officials appear to be more optimistic that progress can be made to end the war, as we’ve reported.He said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning, to “get his assessment of the situation” ahead of the informal EU leaders’ meeting on Ukraine today.“A united and coordinated EU position is key in ensuring a good outcome of peace negotiations - for Ukraine and for Europe,” Costa said on social media.The Kremlin said it has not received any official information regarding the outcome of yesterday’s Ukraine ceasefire talks held in Geneva, Switzerland.“Look, we haven’t seen any plan yet,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing on Monday, adding that Russia would not comment on the details of the draft agreement.“We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been plentiful over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he added.Based on initial media reports, Peskov said, “Some adjustments have been made to the peace plan text we saw earlier. But we’ll wait and see.”Peskov also said there are “no plans yet” for talks with the US delegation this week, and that Moscow remains open for such contacts.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukraine will continue to work closely with the United States on a proposed plan to end the fighting in his country but stressed the importance of ensuring that any plan strengthens Ukraine’s security.“Right now, we are at a critical moment, and we are working closely with the United States, with European partners, with many, many others to define steps that can end Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, and bring real security,” he told a Swedish parliamentary summit by video link.“We will all continue working with partners, especially the United States, looking for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken, us. And we will explain how dangerous it is to pretend that aggression is something one can simply overlook and move on,” he said.Zelensky added that Ukraine has successfully convinced Washington to keep “extremely sensitive points” on the table, including securing the full release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, amid ongoing talks in Geneva, Switzerland.He also called on European nations to make decisions regarding the seizing of Russian assets and said Moscow must “pay fully” for the war.America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva on Sunday, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan — this is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,” Wadephul told Deutschlandfunk radio.“It was clear from the outset, as we have repeatedly said, that any agreement must not be reached over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism yesterday after what he described as productive discussions between American and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine.The talks were “probably the most productive and meaningful” so far, Rubio told reporters after the first session.“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” he said, “The items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today,” he said.The US proposal had attracted bipartisan criticism for its concessions to Russia. The plan puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military’s size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war — all long-standing Kremlin demands.Amid the scrutiny, a US State Department spokesperson maintained that the proposal was “authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”The White House on Sunday said “revisions and clarifications” were made to the proposal with input from top US, Ukrainian, and European officials in Geneva, adding that the Ukrainians believe that the current draft “reflects their national security interests.”",

    "details": "Snapchat has begun asking children and teenagers in Australia to verify their ages, including with software owned by the country’s banks, according to a company spokesperson.In addition to Snapchat, the ban currently applies to YouTube, X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Twitch and Kick.In a statement on Saturday, Snapchat said users will be able to verify their age through the ConnectID application, which links to their bank accounts, or by using software owned by Singapore-headquartered age-assurance provider, k-ID.“The goal here is to protect young people online without creating new privacy risks,” said ConnectID managing director Andrew Black in a statement.In the k-ID option, users can upload government-issued identification cards to verify their ages or submit photos, which the application will then use to estimate an age range.Snapchat added that it “strongly disagreed” with the Australian government’s assessment that it should be included in the social media ban, claiming its service provides a “visual messaging app”.“Disconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn’t make them safer – it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,” it warned.Some other apps have been able to secure an exception from the ban, including Discord, WhatsApp, Lego Play and Pinterest. But Australian authorities have reserved the right to update the list of banned platforms as required.UNICEF Australia has also expressed concerns about implementation, saying the changes proposed by the Australian government “won’t fix the problems young people face online”.“Social media has a lot of good things, like education and staying in touch with friends,” UNICEF Australia said in a statement.“We think it’s more important to make social media platforms safer and to listen to young people to make sure any changes actually help.”Katrina Lines, the CEO of children’s therapy provider Act for Kids, said that parents should start having conversations with children as soon as possible about how they can stay connected as the ban comes into effect over the coming weeks.“It’s important to keep the lines of communication open in the lead up to and even long after these changes take effect,” Lines said.“One way of starting this conversation could be by asking them how they would like to stay connected to friends and family outside of social media,” she said.The Australian ban comes amid growing global concern over the effects of social media on children’s health and safety, and companies including TikTok, Snapchat, Google and Meta Platforms – the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp – are facing lawsuits in the United States for their role in fuelling a mental health crisis.Regulators around the world are closely watching whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work.He said the government was reviewing the mechanisms used in Australia and other nations to impose age restrictions for social media use, citing a need to protect youths from online harms such as cyberbullying, financial scams and child sexual abuse.In New Zealand, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is also planning to introduce a similar bill to restrict children’s social media use, while Indonesia, too, has said it is preparing legislation to protect young people from “physical, mental, or moral perils”.",

    "details": "• US President Donald Trump says “something good just may be happening” following talks in Geneva yesterday on a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Those discussions continue on a technical level today and EU leaders are also meeting for further talks.• Meanwhile, the Kremlin says it has not yet received any official information on the outcome of yesterday’s talks. They were praised by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as “substantive.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has just been speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an informal EU meeting.She says the talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland yesterday established a “solid basis for moving forward” in peace negotiations.Coordination between European countries and a “strong European presence” at the talks “has allowed us to make good progress in the negotiations for just and lasting peace in Ukraine,” von der Leyen said.“While work remains to be done. There is now a solid basis for moving forward,” she added, urging countries to “remain united” and “keep placing Ukraine’s best interests at the center of our efforts.”“This is about the security of our entire continent, now and in (the) future,” von der Leyen said. “Today’s meeting in Luanda reaffirmed that we are united in our support of Ukraine. These are our core European principles moving forward,” she added, stressing that Ukraine’s “territory and sovereignty must be respected.”Tens of thousands of homes across Ukraine were without power this morning, after overnight Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country.For context: Read our analysis here on how Russian forces are exploiting their manpower advantage to edge forward in multiple parts of Ukraine.Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid are a regular occurrence. Since late September, strikes on key power infrastructure have taken place almost daily, depriving Ukrainians of energy and heat ahead of the bitter winter months.Emergency repair work is continuing “wherever security conditions allow,” Ukrenergo said in its statement today. “Energy companies are doing everything possible to restore the equipment damaged by the enemy as quickly as possible.”The United Kingdom, France and Germany had drafted a counter-proposal to the US plan with an array of key changes, Reuters has reported. A European official and a European diplomatic source confirmed the text’s accuracy to CNN’s Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was striking out the language regarding the restriction of further NATO expansion. According to the draft text obtained by Reuters, the European plan states:The European version also removed references to territorial concessions and the US proposal’s recognition of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk as de facto Russian territory.As we’ve reported, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that discussions on a plan to end the war in Ukraine would continue on a technical level today, as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also praised the “substantive” results from yesterday’s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.From Kharkiv region in the north to the farmland of Zaporizhzhia in the south, Russian forces in Ukraine are edging forward, exploiting gaps in Ukrainian defenses and a vast numerical superiority.“Ukraine may now be approaching the point when the country no longer has enough fighters to effectively defend the full length of the front lines,” according to one analysis.Ukraine may be able to step up its deep strikes against Russian energy and military infrastructure. But the Kremlin will see no reason to make concessions at the negotiating table while its troops are on the front-foot.US President Donald Trump has said this morning that “something good just may be happening” regarding a plan to end the war in Ukraine, a day after intensive talks were held between US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland.“Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don’t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding “GOD BLESS AMERICA!”After a day of intensive talks in Geneva on Sunday, however, US officials appear to be more optimistic that progress can be made to end the war, as we’ve reported.He said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this morning, to “get his assessment of the situation” ahead of the informal EU leaders’ meeting on Ukraine today.“A united and coordinated EU position is key in ensuring a good outcome of peace negotiations - for Ukraine and for Europe,” Costa said on social media.The Kremlin said it has not received any official information regarding the outcome of yesterday’s Ukraine ceasefire talks held in Geneva, Switzerland.“Look, we haven’t seen any plan yet,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a briefing on Monday, adding that Russia would not comment on the details of the draft agreement.“We are, of course, closely monitoring the media reports that have been plentiful over the past few days, including from Geneva. But we haven’t received anything official yet,” he added.Based on initial media reports, Peskov said, “Some adjustments have been made to the peace plan text we saw earlier. But we’ll wait and see.”Peskov also said there are “no plans yet” for talks with the US delegation this week, and that Moscow remains open for such contacts.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that Ukraine will continue to work closely with the United States on a proposed plan to end the fighting in his country but stressed the importance of ensuring that any plan strengthens Ukraine’s security.“Right now, we are at a critical moment, and we are working closely with the United States, with European partners, with many, many others to define steps that can end Russia’s war against us, against Ukraine, and bring real security,” he told a Swedish parliamentary summit by video link.“We will all continue working with partners, especially the United States, looking for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken, us. And we will explain how dangerous it is to pretend that aggression is something one can simply overlook and move on,” he said.Zelensky added that Ukraine has successfully convinced Washington to keep “extremely sensitive points” on the table, including securing the full release of all Ukrainian prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia, amid ongoing talks in Geneva, Switzerland.He also called on European nations to make decisions regarding the seizing of Russian assets and said Moscow must “pay fully” for the war.America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva on Sunday, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan — this is a decisive success that we achieved yesterday,” Wadephul told Deutschlandfunk radio.“It was clear from the outset, as we have repeatedly said, that any agreement must not be reached over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism yesterday after what he described as productive discussions between American and Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine.The talks were “probably the most productive and meaningful” so far, Rubio told reporters after the first session.“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” he said, “The items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today,” he said.The US proposal had attracted bipartisan criticism for its concessions to Russia. The plan puts pressure on Kyiv to cede territory, limit its military’s size, and promise not to join NATO in exchange for an end to the war — all long-standing Kremlin demands.Amid the scrutiny, a US State Department spokesperson maintained that the proposal was “authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”The White House on Sunday said “revisions and clarifications” were made to the proposal with input from top US, Ukrainian, and European officials in Geneva, adding that the Ukrainians believe that the current draft “reflects their national security interests.”",

    "details": "Hezbollah confirms death of ‘great commander’ Haytham Ali Tabatabai, and says the Israeli attacks ‘open door to escalation of assaults’.Hezbollah has confirmed that its top military commander Haytham Ali Tabatabai has been killed in an Israeli air strike on Lebanon’s capital.Tabatabai, the chief of staff of the group’s armed wing, was among at least five people killed in the attack on an apartment block in the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh in southern Beirut on Sunday.In a statement, Hezbollah said “the great commander” Tabatabai was killed in “a treacherous Israeli attack on the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburbs of Beirut”, without specifying his position within the group.The Israeli military said it “eliminated” Tabatabai in the strike, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office earlier said he was the target of the attack. Israeli media said it was the military’s third attempt to kill him since last year’s war.Senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qmati had earlier said that Israel’s strike crossed a “red line” and that the group’s leadership was considering whether it would respond.“The strike on the southern suburbs today opens the door to an escalation of assaults all over Lebanon,” he said.Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported that two missiles were fired at the apartment building on al-Arid Street in Haret Hreik, and significant damage was inflicted on cars and surrounding buildings.Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said there is a growing concern in Lebanon that Israel, “which has been acting with impunity, will increase its strikes”.“Hezbollah is in a difficult position,” she said. “It has lost its deterrence capabilities, and without a response, it could invite more Israeli attacks. But if it does respond, it could trigger a bigger Israeli bombardment that could hurt its support base.”Ali Rizk, a security affairs analyst, told Al Jazeera that a major question now is how Hezbollah is going to respond.“In my humble opinion, I don’t think Hezbollah is ready to give Netanyahu what he wants, meaning to give Netanyahu an excuse to launch an all-out war against Lebanon once again. That could help Netanyahu’s political chances. It could also be very costly,” he said.Lebanese President Joseph Aoun called on the international community to intervene firmly to stop the Israeli attacks on the country.In a statement earlier on Sunday, Aoun said Lebanon “reiterates its call to the international community to assume its responsibility and intervene firmly and seriously to stop the attacks on Lebanon and its people”.Israel assassinated longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an air attack on southern Beirut just over a year ago.Sunday’s strike came only days before Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to visit the country amid intensified Israeli aggression in recent weeks.Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar said Israel has been striking all of Lebanon since the ceasefire agreement was brokered by the United States about a year ago.“Every attack on Lebanon is a crossing of a red line, and this aggression is inherent in the entity that targets Lebanon’s dignity, sovereignty, and the security of its citizens,” he said.Israel has been carrying out near-daily strikes on southern Lebanon and has also attacked Beirut several times, but the capital had not been hit in the past several months.A drone hit a car on Tuesday in the car park of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run NNA reported.The Lebanese military issued a plan that the government approved in September that would disarm Hezbollah across the country by the end of the year. Hezbollah has refused to comply while Israel continues to bomb the country and occupy parts of the south.Israel has said Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its military capabilities in southern Lebanon, though the Lebanese government has denied those claims.",

    "details": "Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments. Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "message": "Zelenskyy’s business partner Tymur Mindich as well as two government ministers have been named so far in the investigation, led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), an agency backed by Western governments.  Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated. The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive. The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large.",

    "details": "Israel kills top Hezbollah commander only two days after Lebanon’s president said he was open to negotiations.Israel has killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an attack on Beirut’s southern suburbs, which comes only two days after Lebanon’s president announced the country had succumbed to an Israeli pressure campaign and agreed to hold negotiations.Israeli officials and media have warned of a renewed escalation against Lebanon in recent weeks, claiming Hezbollah is regrouping and rearming. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet approved a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks once. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has repeatedly violated.“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”",

    "details": "Top United States officials are holding talks with Ukrainian and European diplomats in Geneva to discuss US President Donald Trump’s peace plan aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war between Russia and Ukraine.This will likely create some wriggle room for diplomacy at the high-stakes talks in Geneva, Switzerland.So, why are Ukraine’s European allies opposed to the draft plan? Who’s participating? What’s on the agenda in Geneva? And does the plan favour Moscow?The talks are an attempt to reconcile the contentious draft peace plan, as Kyiv and its European allies want Kyiv’s long-term security interests protected.Representatives from Ukraine, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will join top US officials, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss how to end the war – Europe’s deadliest since World War II. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said there will also be a Russian presence.“The concerns are about the territorial concessions: We’re talking about Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, which the Ukrainians, as per the plan, have to give up in exchange for the potential of a permanent deal with Russia. They have to freeze the front lines, particularly in Kherson and Zaporizhia.“The bloodshed must be stopped, and we must ensure that the war is never reignited,” the Ukrainian leader said. “I am awaiting the results of today’s talks and hope that all participants will be constructive. We all need a positive outcome.”The US’s Rubio and Witkoff are leading the Geneva talks, which will also include US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.Nine Ukrainian officials are attending the talks, including Ukraine’s presidential office chief Andriy Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, who have been empowered to deal directly with Russia by the president.Ukraine’s European allies say the current peace plan does not address Ukraine’s security concerns. They say Russia cannot be rewarded with territory for invading Ukraine.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that “any credible and sustainable peace plan should first and foremost stop the killing and end the war, while not sowing the seeds for a future conflict”.She spelled out three elements required for a just and lasting peace, stating that borders should not be changed by force, that there should not be a cap on Ukraine’s military, and that the EU should be central to securing peace for Ukraine.“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” von der Leyen said.“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force,” said a joint statement signed by the UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.The statement noted that the allies were “concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack”, adding that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.According to Trump’s draft plan, Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognised as de facto Russian territory. Ukrainian forces will be required to withdraw from parts of Donetsk that they currently control, while Kherson and Zaporizhia will be frozen along the line of contact.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he spoke with Trump in a long phone call on Friday and conveyed that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process.Von der Leyen noted that a key principle for Kyiv’s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”.French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that Russia would “betray” its promise and “come back” if there are no elements of deterrence and if Ukraine were to cut its army size and follow Trump’s plan.In a post on X, Macron welcomed US efforts to bring peace, but said that the current proposal “must be strengthened” and “Ukraine must never be left vulnerable”.Macron wrote, “Everyone wants peace – except Russia, which continues to stubbornly bomb Ukraine”, adding that support for Ukraine was “decisive”.EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Russia has no legal right whatsoever to any concessions from the country it invaded.”“There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,” the vice president posted on X on Saturday. “Peace won’t be made by failed diplomats or politicians living in a fantasy land. It might be made by smart people living in the real world.”Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was trying to defend its sovereignty while retaining the support of its most important ally, the United States. Trump had said Zelenskyy can “fight his little heart out” if he rejected the proposal.“Now is one of the most difficult moments of our history. Now, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the heaviest. Now, Ukraine can face a very difficult choice — either losing dignity or risk losing a major partner,” Zelenskky said.Accepting the plan, which has been widely viewed as favouring Moscow, would also mean believing “someone who has already attacked us twice”, said Zelenskyy.On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s focus at the talks is “on working as constructively as possible on the steps proposed by the United States”.“We are working to ensure that the path toward ending the war is real and that the principled elements are put into action,” he said after a call with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.European leaders are concerned that Trump’s proposal heavily favours Russia, which has been seeking to control all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow currently holds parts of that territory, though it has been slowly gaining more ground on the battlefronts.A group of US senators said on Saturday that they were told by Rubio, who is also Trump’s national security adviser, that the widely leaked draft peace plan did not reflect the US position, but was a Russian “wish list”.“It looked more like it was written in Russian to begin with,” Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said at a security conference in Canada.However, Rubio denied the assertions, insisting that the plan was “authored by the US” and it was “based on input” from both Russia and Ukraine.Rounds said he had been assured that the plan was presented to Witkoff, Trump’s overseas envoy, by “someone … representing Russia”. The senator continued: “It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.”Later, a US Department of State spokesperson said Rounds’s account of his conversation with Rubio was “blatantly false”.Putin also threatened to seize more territory if Ukraine does not accept the proposal, warning that the reported capture of the Ukrainian city of Kupiansk “will inevitably be repeated in other key areas of the front line”.Speaking from Kyiv, journalist Audrey MacAlpine said Russia has been making battlefield gains in regions of Ukraine where the peace proposal would hand it territory along the line of contact.“No doubt Russia is trying to make gains in these particular regions, and they’ve been successful,” she said. “They’ve been making slow but concerted gains.”Since returning to power for a second term in January, Trump has made resolving foreign conflicts central to US foreign policy. He claimed to have helped end several wars, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, the India-Pakistan war, and the Thailand-Cambodia war, among others. Trump even asked for a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping wars.But he has struggled to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite holding a summit with Putin in Alaska in August.Trump’s first meeting with Zelenskyy ended in acrimony back in February. The US president made up with the Ukrainian leader, hosting him twice at the White House since the February White House meeting. But his attempt to organise a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not materialised.In August, Trump warned Russia of severe consequences if Putin refused to end the war. He even announced sanctions on Moscow to force it to end the war. He also slapped hefty tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, which he said was financing Moscow’s war efforts.As the talks were under way in Geneva on Sunday, Trump again took aim at Ukraine, saying Kyiv has not been grateful for American efforts related to the war with Russia.“UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA. THE USA CONTINUES TO SELL MASSIVE $AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS TO NATO, FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UKRAINE,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on X, echoing remarks he made during a heated exchange in the White House in February in which Trump and US Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy.",

Someone is asking for another bathroom break. Many of these incidents could be avoided, if only we all agreed on some ground rules.Start with a clean car. While you are at it, check all the levels. Check your tire pressure. Change your windshield wipers if you know they’re on their last legs.That little pine tree dangling from the mirror might look cute, but it’s a big no for road trip purposes. For the scent-sensitive, any kind of artificial smell could mean an instant headache and miserable drive.Does someone want to nap while someone else drives, then switch places? Or does one driver want to power through all day? Whatever floats your boat.

Leave the auxiliary activities — navigation, Spotify playlists, Buc-ee’s mile countdowns — to the passengers. Absolutely no texting and driving. And no drinking (duh).For the sake of your fellow passengers alone, take a deep breath. Somebody cut you off? Put “the bird” away and wish them a nice day.You’re the driver’s right hand, the first level of defense against distraction and discomfort. This means you have to navigate, play DJ upon request, change the temperature and generally be an extra set of hands. Don’t be shocked if you’re asked to feed the driver a grape.Sorry you get carsick, but if you’re about to hurl, you better say something. Make your condition known at the start of the trip, maybe sit shotgun if that helps, and stay! off! your! phone! If you do start to feel nauseous, give the driver a heads up ASAP so you can pull over before the point of no return.Everyone must try to use the restroom at scheduled stops.

    "details": "America’s top diplomat struck a relentlessly upbeat tone in Geneva, after a rollercoaster day of intensive negotiations aimed at convincing a skeptical Ukraine to accept the latest US proposals to end Russia’s brutal war.“I feel very optimistic that we can get something done here, because we made a tremendous amount of progress,” the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told me at a late-night news conference at the US Mission in the Swiss city.Even President Donald Trump, who just hours earlier had again publicly scolded the Ukrainian leadership for expressing what he regarded as insufficient gratitude, was now “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made,” Rubio added.But the Secretary of State, who unexpectedly appeared in the briefing room alone, instead of being accompanied, as he had been earlier that day, by the powerful head of the Ukrainian delegation, Andriy Yermak, repeatedly refused to be drawn on the specifics of what had been achieved.“I’m not going to get into the details of the topics we discussed, because this is an ongoing process,” Rubio told me, while suggesting in other comments that “the items that remain are not insurmountable.”But given the extent of the deep compromises Ukraine is being called on to make in the publicly available version of the US peace proposals – which are seen as heavily favoring Russia – the suggestion that they can be easily overcome rings hollow.The proposal for Ukraine to surrender key territories in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, for example, that Russia has annexed but not captured, has been a longstanding red line for Kyiv, not least because the area includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen as essential to Ukrainian security.The US proposals seen by CNN suggest the area becomes a Russian demilitarized zone, which the Kremlin’s military forces would agree not to enter. But ordering the Ukrainian military to hand over land that its troops have fought and died to keep would be a hard sell.But Washington, seemingly even more determined to force through a peace deal, has made it clear it expects Ukraine to comply, threatening to withdraw US military support for Kyiv and to essentially abandon the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – in the words of President Trump – “to fight his little heart out.”In a statement on Sunday night from Washington, the White House said that the Ukrainians believe the latest draft of the peace proposals “reflects their national security interests,” after various revisions and clarifications made with input from top US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva.“The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal concerns – security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty – were thoroughly addressed during the meeting,” the statement said.And it’s not just the White House that appears to be talking up the Geneva negotiations. Earlier, the Ukrainian delegation head Yermak, heaped praise on the talks, calling them “very productive.”“We have had very good progress and we are moving forward to a just and lasting peace,” Yermak added, standing alongside Rubio in an earlier press briefing.Even some Europeans – who had previously expressed concern at being sidelined at the talks in Geneva – seemed to praise their outcome. The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the talks produced a “decisive success” for Europe.“All issues concerning Europe, including those concerning NATO, have been removed from this plan,” Wadephul told the German Deutschlandfunk radio station.There have been some words of caution, such as from the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart before commenting on X that “negotiations were a step forward but there are still major issues to be resolved.”But even if the current draft US peace proposal, which Rubio called a changeable “living, breathing document” does indeed now work for the US, Ukraine and it’s European backers, it is very possible that it would no longer work for the Kremlin, which has consistently refused to back down from its maximalist demands.In Geneva, Rubio repeatedly side-stepped my attempts to ask him whether the US would also expect Russia, not just Ukraine, to make any significant concessions.But if the White House is actually serious about achieving what it now calls “a durable, comprehensive peace” in Ukraine, somehow convincing the Kremlin to compromise may be its best bet.",

Those against said society should care for the sick, not help them die.Several European countries – including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland – already allow terminally ill people to receive medical help to end their lives.Under the disputed law, which was set to take effect this year, lucid but terminally ill patients would have had the right to die if their suffering had become unbearable and all other treatment options had been exhausted.The legislation is similar to the assisted dying bill passed by the United Kingdom Parliament in June. Britain’s bill allows assisted suicide for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, the approvals of two doctors, judicial oversight and self-administration of the medication.Slovenia’s law would require the approval of two doctors but also cooling-off periods and self-administration of the medication.Prime Minister Robert Golob urged citizens to back the law “so that each of us can decide for ourselves how and with what dignity we will end our lives”.Marijan Janzekovic, an 86-year-old who lives in the town of Sveti Tomaz near the capital, Ljubljana, also supports the bill.“She was in a wheelchair … and in pain so bad my heart hurt just by watching her,” he told the Reuters news agency.The main political group opposing the law, called Voice for the Children and the Family, has accused the government of using the law to “poison” ill and elderly people.Opponents said the law is inhumane and violates Slovenia’s Constitution, which declares human life inviolable.Elsewhere, Slovenian Catholic Archbishop Stanislav Zore said the state should focus on palliative care instead.“Let’s care for the sick and dying but not offer them suicide,” he said. The Catholic Church is opposed to euthanasia.Assisted dying is already permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, several states in the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several US states, assisted dying laws are generally framed around medical aid. These jurisdictions typically require that patients be terminally ill, mentally competent and assessed by two independent doctors.In many of these countries, the patient must self-administer lethal medication rather than have a doctor provide it directly. These regimes prioritise patient autonomy and strict procedural safeguards, such as waiting periods.In the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal, the approach to assisted dying is permissive. Active euthanasia or doctor-administered treatment is legal under defined conditions of unbearable suffering, even if the patient is not terminally ill.In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, only assisted suicide is legally tolerated as opposed to active euthanasia. Switzerland is an outlier insofar as there is no dedicated regulatory regime for euthanasia, meaning nonresidents may access the service via organisations.Under the bill, a medical team must assess the patient’s condition before a mandatory reflection period before the prescription of a lethal substance. If the patient is physically unable to self-administer, a doctor or nurse may assist.The proposal excludes people with severe psychiatric conditions or neurodegenerative disorders like advanced Alzheimer’s disease. The bill now has to go to the Senate and must return to the National Assembly for a second reading before it could become law.Elsewhere, Britain’s lower house voted to legalise assisted dying in June. The House of Commons narrowly voted in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, marking a major step towards legalising assisted dying in England and Wales.The bill would allow mentally competent adults with a prognosis of less than six months to live to request medical help to end their lives, subject to assessments by two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a social worker.",

    "details": "Islamabad balances alliances, economic needs and public sentiment as it weighs potential troop deployment to Gaza.Islamabad, Pakistan – When the United Nations Security Council on Monday adopted a United States-authored resolution that paves the way for a transitional administration and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza, Pakistan – which was presiding over the council – had a seemingly contradictory response.Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, thanked the US for tabling the resolution and voted in its favour. But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the mandate of the ISF.“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.In September, Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it shot down Indian jets, Munir met Trump in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s rare earth minerals.Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.Bokhari argued Pakistan has limited options, adding that many of its close allies are “deeply committed” to the initiative and have sought Islamabad’s participation.“Pakistan’s economic and financial problems mean it will need to reciprocate militarily in order to secure” the goodwill of the US and Islamabad’s Gulf allies, he said. “We have to assume that the current civilian-military leadership is aware of the domestic political risks.”Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”",

    "details": "In subreddits and X threads, commenters seem to be railing more and more against terrible visual effects and wondering why modern films and TV shows look so bad.But is that actually true? Let’s flip the question: When was the last time you saw incredible CGI or other visual effects? Probably a tougher question to answer. That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming. Some of the tight turns meant a cameraman had to run backward to keep Scott in the shot.Director Ben Stiller later said some of the shots were too full of blank, white walls. The team added in a fully computer-generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.Shooting begins on the project.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

Marketing and trailers start in earnest at this stage.“[“Jurassic World Rebirth” director] Gareth Edwards said that prep and shoot is where you go shopping for your meal, and post is where you actually get to cook it,” said Vickery.The visual effects team works in close conjunction with the director and editor throughout this phase. Artists will create rough drafts of the visual effects with the real footage for the director’s approval and feedback. The editor will incorporate the evolving VFX shots into the main edit. As the shots come together, the director can see the overall flow of the film and slowly, the picture comes alive.But Helman emphasizes that regardless of how many shots there are, the end goal is to make a cohesive story. “It always goes back to sitting around a fire with a bunch of people at night, listening to somebody telling a story. You’re just changing the tools a little bit. And that’s all we are. We are a tool to tell a story,” Helman said.A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual one in a CG world.Environmental specialists build the CG world.

For instance, the elevator doorway needed to be blended with the real-life set.Every visual effects shot goes through multiple rounds of feedback and painstaking edits. Maybe the edges of moving hair don’t quite have the right amount of blur. Maybe a door looks too narrow. The “Wicked” team, for example, paid particular attention to the animals so they could get across emotional nuances despite limited facial expressions.And if that weren’t enough, the marketing team starts its job well in advance of the finish line. “It’s like releasing an ad campaign out before the product’s ready,” said Vickery. Audience screenings often happen midway through post production, and trailers are needed before the film is finished. “They’re definitely things that make for a lot of hard work from the visual effects department.”This year’s “Superman,” for example, released a trailer that got some people up in arms over a oddly edited shot of Superman flying. Fans claimed there was “bad CGI” on actor David Corenswet’s face, but director James Gunn later said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was just an unfinished VFX composite shot that’s “not even the shot that’s in the movie.”At the end of the day, even the best visual effects team can be undercut by unreasonable expectations and timelines. And for the artists, it can be frustrating when only the worst of their work gets noticed.Leven also echoed similar sentiments and explained poor work is rarely because of a lack of talent or technology.“Usually the effects artists working on it don’t have enough time. Maybe it was a last-minute addition. Maybe there wasn’t a clear vision from the filmmakers as to what they wanted,” Leven said. “There are a lot of different reasons, but it’s usually not because CGI is not capable of making the shot look amazing.”",

That’s because VFX, like any other filmmaking tool, is invisible when done well.“There are many things that you don’t see as visual effects because it’s a lot more subtle,” said Pablo Helman of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), visual effects supervisor on both “Wicked” movies. “There’s a lot of ingenuity and magic put into creating something that is so organic that, like the music, you just take it in [as part] of the storytelling.”Test your eye for visual effects with our quiz, and we’ll walk you through how artists bring a scene to life.To get visual effects from an idea to the screen involves three broad stages: preproduction, production and postproduction. Or in layman’s terms: planning, making and refining.Important to note: The term visual effects is often mistakenly used interchangeably with CGI, but the two are distinct. VFX can include CGI, but it also includes other techniques such as matte painting, or compositing different images — sometimes computer-generated, sometimes live-action — together using blue or green screens.“Wicked,” for example, shot many of its scenes using a combination of real sets and blue screens, blending together the practical and the digital.Preproduction for visual effects starts with the budget and time. VFX vendors often work through a competitive bidding process, where multiple companies bid on sequences the client wants done. These bids are ballpark budget estimates, including suggestions for where visual effects are needed, the number of shots and timelines. They’re fluid and can change even past the preproduction phase as the movie is being made.“You draw a storyboard, you think, ‘This is what it’s gonna look like. This is how much it’s gonna cost.’ And then when you film it, it’s something else altogether. … [So bids] will continue to evolve as the work in the project changes,” said ILM’s David Vickery, visual effects supervisor on “Jurassic World Rebirth.”Preproduction is also where all the visual research happens. Previsualization (or previs) artists create rough, simplified art assets  to help map out the creative blueprint for the project. This can include drawn storyboards and basic animations that show how VFX will fit into a scene’s flow or where green screens should be placed.But previs can look different for every film depending on the filmmakers’ preferences. “Wicked,” for instance, used real, physical models of sets and characters on sticks to plan out scenes because Director Jon Chu preferred a more tactile approach. (Both “Wicked” and “Wicked: For Good” were filmed at the same time.)Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming. Some of the tight turns meant a cameraman had to run backward to keep Scott in the shot.Director Ben Stiller later said some of the shots were too full of blank, white walls. The team added in a fully computer-generated office in this scene to make the background more interesting.Dolly shots were those using a camera on a track, while gimbal or handheld shots involved a crew member with a camera running after Adam Scott while filming.

The team added in a fully computer-“We’re kind of the glue that links all of the departments in a film,” said Vickery. He explained that other teams will frequently come to the visual effects group with questions.The stunt department: “Can [visual effects] paint out the crash mats?” The set designers: “Do we need to build the whole set? Can we just build the walls up to here and then blue screens?” Costume department: “Are you using blue screen or green screen? We’re going to have characters wearing blue, so we need to know whether we can do that or not.”Shooting begins on the project. VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.Shooting begins on the project.

VFX artists work on-set to make sure the right footage is shot and handle unexpected problems.In the production stage, actual film shooting begins on the project. Visual effects supervisors or artists will work on set to make sure the right footage is shot; maybe a green screen needs to be put in a specific spot, or photos and lighting measurements need to be taken of the area for artists so that CG objects will match the environment. Because the process is so complicated, there are inevitable problems on the day-of to deal with too.Helman also described a case in “Wicked,” where real glass could cause complicated light reflections.That’s when the visual effects team weighs in: Can it get fixed in post? According to Leven, it often depends. “What will it take to fix it? Will it look as good? Versus how long is it gonna take to reshoot? … It’s just this constant, ‘Yes, this one we can fix in post, no problem. This one you should probably redo on the day.’” For the “Wicked” scene, Helman decided to remove the glass from the set entirely and to put it back in using visual effects.Another example: “Jurassic World Rebirth” used computer-generated capuchin monkeys for an opening scene because the crew wasn’t allowed to film real animals in Thailand, where the movie was largely shot.“We can actually put our live-action Jack [Champion, who plays Spider,] into our virtual set at the right depth plane. If he walks behind a Na’vi, then in the camera that Jim [Cameron] is looking at, Jack will actually walk behind that virtual Na’vi or in amongst trees,” said Eric Saindon of Wētā FX, senior VFX supervisor for “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.”The Avatar films are unique projects with a different workflow than many movies. Usually, shots are planned in preproduction and the footage is shot in the production phase. In Avatar’s case, the team recorded and tracked the actors’ movements and transformed it into motion data — a process called performance capture — in the preproduction phase, Saindon and and Wētā FX Senior Animation Supervisor Dan Barrett said.This is because when filming the performance-capture scenes, the exact angles or specifics of the shot were not as important as the motion data collected. As the performers were acting, face cams and motion-capture suits helped track the actors’ nuances, while other cameras around the set shot reference footage of larger movements. This data was then used to re-create the entire performance with the actors and the environment in a virtual world.“Jim can essentially stand inside the CG world. And as he moves his camera around, he sees that world because the data’s being fed straight back,” said Barrett.This camera, a simple handheld device with a screen, displays a CG re-creation of already filmed scenes.These spheres, made of glass, reflect light back up to infrared sensors high above the set, allowing them to track the camera’s precise orientation and position.Once combined with settings for focal length, exposure, focus and sensor size, the virtual camera functions much like a physical camera shooting live footage.

Marketing and trailers start in earnest at this stage.“[“Jurassic World Rebirth” director] Gareth Edwards said that prep and shoot is where you go shopping for your meal, and post is where you actually get to cook it,” said Vickery.The visual effects team works in close conjunction with the director and editor throughout this phase. Artists will create rough drafts of the visual effects with the real footage for the director’s approval and feedback. The editor will incorporate the evolving VFX shots into the main edit. As the shots come together, the director can see the overall flow of the film and slowly, the picture comes alive.But Helman emphasizes that regardless of how many shots there are, the end goal is to make a cohesive story. “It always goes back to sitting around a fire with a bunch of people at night, listening to somebody telling a story. You’re just changing the tools a little bit. And that’s all we are. We are a tool to tell a story,” Helman said.A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual one in a CG world.Environmental specialists build the CG world. In this case, that meant things like the elevator doors and false walls.An animator was also needed here to create a CG version of Adam Scott so his reflection on the doors showed up properly.A technical director double checks details so they appear accurately, such as the level of reflection on the shiny, metal elevator doors.And finally, a compositor combines all the different environments into one. For instance, the elevator doorway needed to be blended with the real-life set.A layout artist takes the physical camera movements of the real-life camera and translates it into a virtual camera in a CG world.Environmental specialists build the CG world.

For instance, the elevator doorway needed to be blended with the real-life set.Every visual effects shot goes through multiple rounds of feedback and painstaking edits. Maybe the edges of moving hair don’t quite have the right amount of blur. Maybe a door looks too narrow. The “Wicked” team, for example, paid particular attention to the animals so they could get across emotional nuances despite limited facial expressions.And if that weren’t enough, the marketing team starts its job well in advance of the finish line. “It’s like releasing an ad campaign out before the product’s ready,” said Vickery. Audience screenings often happen midway through post production, and trailers are needed before the film is finished. “They’re definitely things that make for a lot of hard work from the visual effects department.”This year’s “Superman,” for example, released a trailer that got some people up in arms over a oddly edited shot of Superman flying. Fans claimed there was “bad CGI” on actor David Corenswet’s face, but director James Gunn later said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that it was just an unfinished VFX composite shot that’s “not even the shot that’s in the movie.”At the end of the day, even the best visual effects team can be undercut by unreasonable expectations and timelines. And for the artists, it can be frustrating when only the worst of their work gets noticed.Leven also echoed similar sentiments and explained poor work is rarely because of a lack of talent or technology.“Usually the effects artists working on it don’t have enough time. Maybe it was a last-minute addition. Maybe there wasn’t a clear vision from the filmmakers as to what they wanted,” Leven said. “There are a lot of different reasons, but it’s usually not because CGI is not capable of making the shot look amazing.”",

    "details": "• US Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted “tremendous progress” in today’s talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva, Switzerland, saying the sticking points on the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine peace proposal are “not insurmountable.” Ukraine has also said the delegations made good progress.• Even as the talks progressed, President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukraine’s leaders this morning, claiming they have “expressed zero gratitude” for his efforts to end the war. Ukraine’s president has repeatedly thanked the US publicly. Rubio later signaled that those tensions had been smoothed over and said Trump is “pleased” with the progress.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has departed Geneva, Switzerland, and is heading back to Washington, DC, following high-level meetings on a peace plan for Ukraine, a senior State Department official said today.Rubio indicated that discussions would continue on a technical level as he expressed optimism “that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”It’s not clear whether other US officials have left Geneva, though Rubio said earlier that “we have all kinds of people at technical levels that are working full time on this and engaged in this full time.”Earlier today, Rubio heralded “tremendous progress” following meetings with Ukrainian officials to end the war, calling the discussions “the most productive day in the entirety of our efforts.”The final agreement, he noted, will require sign-off from US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia will also need to sign off on the plan.The White House said today that the Ukrainians believe the current draft of a peace plan to end the war “reflects their national security interests,” after “revisions and clarifications” were made with input from top US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva, Switzerland.“The Ukrainian delegation affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting,” the statement said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had praised the “substantive” results from the meeting. “Much is changing: We are working very carefully on the steps needed to end the war,” he said in a video address posted on Telegram.Separately, Ukraine also expressed its gratitude toward the US and President Donald Trump in a joint statement released by the White House.“The Ukrainian delegation reaffirmed its gratitude for the steadfast commitment of the United States and, personally, President Donald J. Trump for their tireless efforts aimed at ending the war and the loss of life,” the statement said.Just this morning, Trump lashed out at Ukrainian leadership for what he called a lack of gratitude, and it seems the Ukrainians have responded, in kind, with several mentions of thanks to the US and Trump.Zelensky posted on X that “Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump” for assistance that has saved Ukrainian lives.Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak told reporters, “We thank our big friends, United States, and personally President Trump and his team to their commitment to bring this peace.”“My thoughts is that this is not a peace plan, it’s a surrender plan,” Meeks told CNN’s Jessica Dean.The New York Democrat accused the Trump administration of essentially giving “Russia more than Russia would’ve asked for.” Meanwhile, Moscow will give up “absolutely nothing,” he claimed.“If we do this to Ukraine, then what does that mean for the rest of NATO? Because that means Putin can continue to go wherever he wants, knowing that the United States of America may not have their back,” he said.Key context: The original draft of the Trump administration’s proposal has been widely criticized for being too favorable to Russia, as it would concede many long-standing Kremlin demands.After talks in Geneva today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed that the proposal is a “living, breathing document” that is shifting in response to input from Ukraine and other parties. Rubio said “the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” and the Ukrainian delegation also emerged from the talks with a positive assessment.The current outline of the proposal — and whether it’s one Moscow would ever sign on to — remains to be seen.Top US diplomats and Ukrainian officials are expressing optimism after holding talks in Geneva today, though it remains to be seen if Moscow would sign on to the terms the two sides have been discussing.The positive messaging came despite President Donald Trump lashing out at Kyiv’s leaders this morning, claiming they have “expressed zero gratitude” for his efforts to end the war with Russia, despite many examples to the contrary.CNN’s Svitlana Vlasova, Mitchell McCluskey, Kit Maher, Nina Subkhanberdina and Betsy Klein contributed to this post.The text was confirmed as accurate by one European official and one European diplomatic source speaking to CNN’s chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh.One of those officials said the text was an accurate reflection of European bids to change the US draft proposal, but that further alterations could have been made during fast-moving talks in Geneva today.Here’s how the plan differs: Among the key changes included in the counter-proposal was a softening of the language around restricting NATO in Europe.The European version also removed mention of territorial concessions. The regions of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk were all explicitly recognized as de facto Russian in the US plan. In the new European proposal, all recognitions of Russian control are removed. It demands a ceasefire before determining territorial swaps, and that the current front line be the basis for any future discussions.The European proposal removes all references to US-Russia investment structures, shifting toward an approach where Russia pays reparations to Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the “substantive” results from diplomatic discussions held today in Geneva, Switzerland.“Much is changing: We are working very carefully on the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel this evening.As the delegates headed into today’s talks, US President Donald Trump had accused the Ukrainians of showing insufficient gratitude for US efforts — echoing a past criticism that’s at odds with Kyiv’s public record of thanking US leaders.“Diplomacy has been activated, which is good,” Zelensky said. “The first priority is reliable peace, guaranteed security, respect for our people, respect for everyone who gave their lives defending Ukraine from Russian aggression.”He also urged Ukrainians not to send “conflicting signals” and to maintain unity in their messaging.The Ukrainian president held discussions with several world leaders today, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and the prime ministers of Canada, Croatia and Luxembourg.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated Sunday that the Thursday deadline set by President Donald Trump for Ukraine to accept the United States’ peace proposal is fluid.“The deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible. Obviously, you know, we would love it to be Thursday. … We’ve really moved forward, so I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon,” Rubio said in Geneva, Switzerland.“Whether it’s Thursday, whether it’s Friday, whether it’s Wednesday, whether it’s Monday of the following week, we want it to be soon, because people are going to die,” Rubio said.Rubio said the US recognizes that Ukraine needs to have security guarantees as part of a peace proposal, but he did not delve into specifics of what was discussed.“I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel as it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again,” Rubio said.While Rubio said it’s “possible” a call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky could occur later, he said was unsure.“This is a living, breathing document. Every day, with input, it changes,” Rubio said, later adding: “I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable. We just need more time than what we have today.”Rubio declined to get into the specifics when pressed by CNN’s Matthew Chance on whether the Ukrainians have indicated they are prepared to compromise, given that it’s “an ongoing process.”“Just because it’s printed on a piece of paper doesn’t indicate finality, so you get input, and based on that input, you make adjustments and then you get more input,” Rubio said.Rubio noted that “the Russians get a vote here” and will be consulted in the next step toward peace.“Obviously, we now have to take what we come up with — if we can reach that agreement with the Ukrainian side — to the Russian side,” he said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Sunday that he conveyed to President Donald Trump that talks with Ukrainian officials were “very positive” and that the president is “pleased” with the progress.“It was very positive — I’m telling you today was the most productive,” Rubio said upon conclusion of Sunday’s discussions in Geneva, Switzerland.Pressed by CNN’s Matthew Chance on Trump’s comments earlier in the day lashing out at Ukraine for what the president described as a lack of gratitude, Rubio signaled those tensions had been smoothed over.Trump said in a social media post earlier that “Ukraine’s ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts.”“Today — and we’ve talked to him since — I think he’s quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made,” he said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio heralded “tremendous progress” following diplomatic talks with Ukrainian officials to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, calling Sunday’s discussions “the most productive day in the entirety of our efforts.”Going into the talks, he said, there was “one goal” — to “try to narrow” the disagreements around key points.The final agreement, he noted, will require sign-off from US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia will also need to sign off on the plan to end the nearly four-year war.There are still some sticking points, Rubio said, characterizing the outstanding issues as “a couple issues that we need to continue to work on.”“I don’t want to declare victory or finality here. There’s still some work to be done, but we are much further ahead today, at this time, than we were when we began this morning,” he said.We heard from both the US and Ukrainian delegations after the early session of talks in Geneva, with each side projecting optimism.In case you missed it, here’s US Secretary of State Marco Rubio first. Rubio described the meeting as the “most productive and meaningful” so far:And here’s Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian presidential office, who also said the sides were making progress today:President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is part of the US delegation meeting with Ukrainian officials in Geneva.Kushner has played a key role at times in US diplomacy in the Middle East and elsewhere during Trump’s first and second term.The Trump administration has been rushing to move forward a deal to end the war in Ukraine in the weeks since a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, which Kushner also helped broker.The delegation is led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Other members include special envoy Steve Witkoff, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, State Department counselor Mike Needham, NATO Supreme Allied Commander Alexis Grynkewich, deputy national security adviser Andy Baker, and the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Julie Davis.Earlier in the day, when I asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio whether the US would turn its back on Ukraine if it rejected the peace proposal, Rubio stormed past, stony-faced.Hours later, he came out to speak to the press — alongside Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak — and seemed more upbeat. Both Rubio and Yermak were speaking of progress and appeared to be in a positive frame of mind.Intensive face-to-face negotiations are now continuing into the evening here in Geneva with US and Ukrainian officials indicating they may have more to say on the outcome of the talks later tonight.But the big question remains whether the process underway right now may be the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine or yet another performative dead end.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his call for a strong and lasting peace as US and Ukrainian delegations hold talks in Geneva.Zelensky said the “crux of the entire diplomatic situation” is that Russia has refused to end its invasion.“Putin has been waging this war with complete disregard for how many of his own people he loses and how many of ours he kills,” Zelensky wrote in an X post today.The Ukrainian leader said he was grateful to President Donald Trump and European leaders for engaging in discussions about the US-proposed peace deal. His comments come after Trump accused Ukraine’s leaders of showing “zero gratitude” for US assistance, despite Zelensky and others repeatedly thanking the president publicly.“It is important not to forget the main goal — to stop Russia’s war and prevent it from ever igniting again. And to achieve that, peace must be dignified,” Zelensky said. “That is why we work so carefully on every point, on every step toward peace. Everything must work out the right way — so that this war is truly ended and so that it does not happen again.”Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she was mostly concerned with the use of the US military on domestic soil when she recently taped a video alongside fellow Democrats advising service members to refuse illegal orders the Trump administration might issue.“My primary concern is the use of US military on American shores, on our city, in our cities and in our streets,” Slotkin said today on ABC’s “This Week.”Slotkin advised service members to speak to their judge advocate general officers to “ask them for explanation, for top cover, for their view on things.”“It is very clear that no one should follow an illegal order, but it’s very murky when you look at, what is an illegal order, and if you go into morally, ethically, that’s a pretty tough thing to look at and say, ‘How do I navigate this?’” she added.President Donald Trump reacted furiously to the video last week, suggesting the lawmakers’ actions were, “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”Slotkin criticized Trump’s response, though she said it won’t prevent her from continuing to speak her mind. “But obviously the president took issue with one sentence in a video and was calling for our death. I think that’s inappropriate,” Slotkin said.While the president’s call to arrest the lawmakers — which he doubled down on today — has been roundly criticized by Democrats, the remarks have also attracted some rare criticism from Republicans.GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky rebuked Trump’s rhetoric toward the six Democrats today, calling the president’s behavior “reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible” in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian president’s office, said the Ukrainian delegation had “a very productive first session” with US officials in Geneva today, as talks continue to bring an end to the war with Russia.“We have very good progress, and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace. Ukrainian people deserve and want this peace more than anyone in this planet,” Yermak said alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who also shared an upbeat assessment.President Donald Trump lashed out at Ukrainian leadership on social media this morning for what he described as a lack of gratitude. In his remarks to reporters, Yermak thanked the US president: “We thank our big friends, United States, and personally President Trump and his team for their commitment to bring this peace.”It marked another example of the many times Ukrainian officials have publicly expressed appreciation for the administration.“We also will engage our European friends, and of course, the final words will be of our leaders, of the President of United States and Ukraine, and I hope that we can achieve the good progress today,” Yermak said.Secretary of State Marco Rubio projected optimism after what he described as productive discussions between the US and Ukrainian officials in Geneva today.“It is my personal view that we’ve had probably the most productive and meaningful meeting so far in this entire process since we’ve been involved,” Rubio told reporters in Switzerland a short time ago.According to a draft, its provisions would include Kyiv ceding territory to Russia, giving up any ambitions to join NATO, and limiting the size of its army.US and Ukrainian officials, Rubio said, are now meeting separately to work through some adjustments to the plan, with the hopes “of further narrowing the differences.”Ultimately, he added, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will need to approve the plan. Rubio said he felt “very comfortable about that happening, given the progress we’ve made.”“As the day progressed, the Ukrainians and US delegation got together to have detailed discussions about the peace agreement,” a US official said. “There’s a formal meeting between the two delegations where they will be ironing out the details of the agreement,” they added.While it’s important for Ukraine to iron out its differences with the US, the ultimate test will be if it can come to an agreement with Moscow.CNN’s Ali Main, Manu Raju, Auzinea Bacon, Natasha Bertrand, Avery Schmitz and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post.",

    "details": "One Monday in mid-October, after a year in US immigration detention, officers arrived unannounced at Majid's cell in Texas.They told him simply to \"pack up\" - that he was being moved - even though an immigration judge had already granted him protection from removal five months ago. Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.As the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, which was a central plank of Trump's winning re-election campaign, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers.In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.With officially recognised churches tightly restricted, house churches have begun to emerge across the country. But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"Asylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles. In video filmed by their pastor, Marjan is seen collapsed outside as agents detain her husband. Moments earlier she had called him pleading for help. The couple - both Christian converts from Iran who had applied for asylum in the US - were taken to separate detention centres. Weeks later, their cases diverged: Marjan was granted asylum in California, while Reza, held in New Mexico, was ordered to be removed to a third country.After their June arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said on its X account that \"during a targeted enforcement operation in Los Angeles, Border Patrol agent apprehended two Iranian nationals unlawfully present in the US - both flagged as subjects of national security interest.\"Pastor Ara Torosian, who filmed their arrest, disputes the Department of Homeland Security's claim that the couple were unlawfully present in the US.In the US, Ali is living with a friend from his church, and hoping his own asylum claim will be more successful than that of his wife, who was deported to Iran this year.\"If they grant me asylum, how can I stay here when my wife is in Iran? If they deport me, I could go to prison the moment I land.\"Unable to work legally or open a bank account. He first stayed with a distant relative \"just until my wife's case was resolved,\" but she was never released and, after nearly a year in detention, was deported. A small church later offered him temporary shelter.He is awaiting an immigration hearing but sees no good outcome. His wife has received another summons from Iranian intelligence.Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.The Church of England is grappling with what to do about followers of the far-right figure embracing faith.While the US escalates a military threat in nearby waters, Venezuelans say the real enemy of the people is a sharp rise in food prices.",

Although she renounced some of her past conspiratorial views, the House voted to remove her from her committee assignments shortly after she took office.When Republicans returned to power in Congress she had a political rehabilitation of sorts, working with then Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy to consolidate conservative support in the chamber. When McCarthy was ousted, Greene fought with his replacement, Mike Johnson, and launched an unsuccessful bid to remove him as well.She had become a political wildcard – still despised by many on the left but also viewed with suspicion by conservatives. She still had close ties with Trump, which gave her influence in Washington.In a brief interview on Friday night, Trump told ABC News that Greene's departure from Congress was \"great news for the country\".He would later post on Truth Social that Greene \"went bad\" but that he would \"always appreciate Marjorie and thank her for her service to our country\".Greene said she will return to her home in Georgia and a \"new path ahead\". Although she had reportedly expressed interest in the state's governor race next year, she recently said she would not seek that office – or seek to unseat incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.Her decision to resign effective 5 January, however, leaves open the possibility that she could change her mind and run for office in a state where Republican politicians, like the current Georgia governor Brian Kemp, have shown that it is possible to win elections even without Trump's support.The move also allows Greene to reposition herself politically, as the Republican Party begins grappling with an environment where public support for Trump - particularly his handling of the economy - appears to be souring and the president, limited by the constitution, will never appear on a presidential ballot again.Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.While the US escalates a military threat in nearby waters, Venezuelans say the real enemy of the people is a sharp rise in food prices.US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.",

A similar controversial exercise was carried out in India's Bihar state recently.As part of this exercise, polling booth-level officers visit households across towns and villages, collecting personal identity details and voter card numbers.\"My employers approve time off only during elections and festivals. If I take leave now, I will lose my salary. I can't afford that. And someone else could replace me,\" Anjali Mondol, who works as a domestic help, told the BBC.Similar concerns were echoed by others in the slum. Subhashri Doloi, also a domestic worker, says: \"I was saving money to travel home in a few months to cast my vote. But if I use that money now, how will I go again during the election?\"Some worry about the gaps in their official documents - a common problem across India, especially in rural areas.Kusum Devi, who works in a garment factory in Delhi, is a registered voter in her village in Uttar Pradesh - one of the states where the SIR is ongoing. But her Aadhaar, a national unique identification number, shows her as a resident of Delhi.Workers also worry that the SIR could affect their access to welfare schemes. For those from West Bengal (another state where SIR is ongoing), which borders Bangladesh, there is an added fear of being asked to prove their citizenship.Crackdowns on alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are not new in India. In recent months, hundreds of people have been arrested on suspicion of being illegal migrants.\"Nobody wants to be wrongfully branded as Bangladeshi,\" said Yaser Ali from West Bengal, who sells utensils. \"If this [SIR] helps us, we want to make sure that it is done right. But how do we do it on such short notice?\"Under the guidelines, there is a provision to fill the SIR form online but most migrant workers the BBC spoke to said they were either unfamiliar with the process or found it \"too risky\".The EC has dismissed these concerns, saying the process is being carried out in the most transparent manner.In a statement shared with the BBC, the poll panel urged voters to opt for online verification, saying the option has been introduced especially \"for the convenience of those electors who are currently not at their place of residence\".The physical forms, on the other hand, can be filled up by the electors themselves or \"any adult family member\", by mentioning their relationship with the elector, and handed over to the booth-level officers, it said.The EC added that it will ensure that \"sufficient opportunity and time is given to the electors for filing claims and objections\".People whose names do not appear in those lists must produce one additional document - such as their birth or caste certificates, passports, school records, post-office papers and bank documents - to be able to enrol.Those who became eligible voters or were born after the reference year must also show supporting documents for one or both their parents.Some workers are hopeful. Ramdhin Prajapati, a factory worker who votes in Uttar Pradesh, says he sees SIR as a \"one-time effort\" he is willing to make.\"There is hardly any time,\" says Uma Muniam, who works as a cook in Delhi. \"There are millions of migrants like me spread across India. Will they be able to travel twice in four months - once for SIR and again for election?\"Rajesh Kumar, a Delhi-based trade unionist, says the poll panel needs to do more to create awareness about the process. \"Most migrant workers lack job security and the SIR exercise is causing them stress,\" he said.\"It would be useful if help desks were set up in big cities to assist these workers,\" Mr Kumar says.Mr Mallick, one of the few migrants travelling to his West Bengal village for the SIR, has become a go-to figure in the slum, fielding constant questions. Some want him to fill out their forms once he reaches home; others, who've already sent papers to relatives, want him to check if the process has gone through.Mr Mallick's feedback will help his neighbours decide whether, and when, they need to make the journey themselves.",

    "details": "With many families left traumatised by killings apparently linked to supposed  magic rituals in Sierra Leone, BBC Africa Eye looks into those behind the trade in human body parts.\"Today I'm in pain. They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions.On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a researcher at the UK's Aberystwyth University, told the BBC.When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there is a \"renewed commitment to multilateral co-operation\".",

    "details": "Business leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year.Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.And, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the \"big things\" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.When it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.The head of the CBI business group, Rain Newton-Smith, has said \"stability is the only road to growth\" and urged the government not to hit businesses with more taxes.The chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.Business Secretary Peter Kyle addressed the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference on Monday, and had a couple of business-friendly policies to announce.He told the conference: \"Let's not kid ourselves — actual growth, real growth, comes from enterprise and wealth creation.\"We will build a pro-business, pro-wealth creation, pro-growth Britain. This week's budget will take the fair and necessary choices to embed that further.\"The chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as \"probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament\", as a way of removing barriers to growth.Bank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative.It is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis.That in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.The oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the \"windfall\" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.Among bosses there is still concern over the government's flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one.Rain Newton-Smith told the CBI conference that the government should \"change course\" on the bill and that businesses were not being listened to.The business secretary told the BBC's Today programme on Monday that any changes to the law would \"be implemented in a way that is benefiting business and benefiting the people who work in business\".Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the bill her speech to the CBI, saying it would allow new hires to lodge claims with an employment tribunal \"before they've even worked out where the toilets are\".The chancellor is also expected to speak in the Budget about consumers having the \"confidence to spend\".Some in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm's wage structure.One other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.Such schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come.What the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.",

    "details": "The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty.Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: \"Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung).\"Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.\"The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again.\"Japan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments.Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a \"fab\", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow.Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there.\"This will make a form of 'global ecosystem',\" Mr Koike says, \"where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world.\"Mr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players.\"TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race,\" Mr Koike said.Global demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers -  still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers.\"We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value,\" Mr Koike said.For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.Authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate.Armed men posing as bank officials robbed a van transporting cash between bank branches in Bengaluru city.",

By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably.\"Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have \"made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear\".Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said.\"Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety.\"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"This government is delivering a golden age of new nuclear as we drive for energy sovereignty and abundance.\"A crucial part of that is delivering the reforms we need to drive forward new nuclear in a safe, affordable way.\"The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world.In contrast, Germany has phased out its use of nuclear power, prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen.Mike Childs, head of policy for environmental campaigning group Friends of the Earth, said: \"Nuclear power has always been and will always be extraordinarily expensive, not because of regulation but because of the nature of the technology.\"Investing in energy efficiency, renewable power and energy storage is the economically sensible route to keep energy bills affordable.\"If approved, it would be the first time Japanese utility company Tepco recommences nuclear reactor operations since its Fukushima plant went into meltdown.The comments by arguably the most senior US diplomat in Europe come as the UK and US look to boost economic ties.",

It is a bizarre situation.England's original plan was not to send anyone for the game against the Prime Minister's XI, so little has changed. The likes of Zak Crawley, Joe Root and Harry Brook, who appear to need some time at the crease, will be off to Brisbane to bat in the nets.England are responsible for their preparation and their performances on the field. They are responsible for giving it their best shot of winning the Ashes. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.Just because Australia are accustomed to these matches and England are not, it does not mean England cannot win.But there is a huge question about whether England would be better prepared playing a game under lights than spending time in the nets in Brisbane.England - the management, players and administrators - will be held to account at the end of the Ashes if their plans do not work.In the aftermath of the heavy defeat in the first Test I have been struck by the genuine anger among supporters.People have spent a lot of money and there is real frustration, a depth of feeling I don't think I have seen before. The England team ignore that at their peril.It was the worst defeat of an England team I have seen in a Test in this country. They should have won. Instead, the game was tossed away calamitously and feebly.Stokes told me his team works hard. I cannot disagree with him. We see them train and know they give it absolutely everything. They are supremely fit. Potts looks like he should be in the SAS.Under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, England have decided they are going to play in a certain way. They say it is a method that gives them the best chance of winning.Is that correct? It did not work in the fifth Test against India at The Oval, a game they should have won. It has not worked here.Supporters fell back in love with the England team, which was vital for the health of the game in our country.However, there were some of us who knew the method was unsustainable. The mood around England was positive, so the dissenters stayed quiet.I have spoken to a number of former Australia players since the first Test ended. One problem they identified is a lack of accountability in the England set-up.There should be some reflection on what happened in Perth, looking at what happened in a mature fashion.The shots Brook was playing were from the third XI of a village team. He needs to grow up. Compare Brook with the wonderful innings of Travis Head. There is a huge difference between recklessness and controlled aggression.We have laboured the point about England's limited preparation, but a lot of what we feared came true in the first Test.When it was announced that England had only one warm-up game against the Lions, we could have predicted how wickets would fall in the first Test: edging rising deliveries outside off stump by attempting to play booming drives. Look what happened.A lot of the anger aimed at England comes from a feeling they do not care. Supporters see the way these England players get out and think it does not matter to them.The golf narrative is another I can defend England from. When they train, they train hard. What are they supposed to do for the rest of the day? Sit in their hotel rooms watching Netflix? There is nothing wrong with being in the fresh air, doing something to take the mind away from cricket.But Stokes, McCullum and the rest must pick themselves up and understand the right way to go about things in Brisbane.This England team will have gone through the same in Perth and should now be determined not to have a repeat in Brisbane.Vaughan confused by 'amateurish' England plans before second Test.

    "details": "Maybe it was all very predictable. After being enraged by their disallowed goal at Manchester City before the international break, Liverpool got stung again by the confusing subjective offside law.Was Dan Ndoye impacting Alisson when Murillo gave Nottingham Forest the lead at Anfield? You can make an argument for it, after all he was stood in front of the goalkeeper and the ball went past him. But, like at Manchester City two weeks ago, the video assistant referee (VAR) let the on-field decision stand.In one game, Liverpool have a goal disallowed. In the other, Liverpool concede a goal. It has got to sting.We've been here before, and we'll be here again. And while it might not seem like it right now, discussions about subjective offside decisions are not a new thing.When Eberechi Eze scored the Gunners' second goal, Bukayo Saka, Martin Zubimendi and Leandro Trossard were all in an offside position in front of the Spurs goalkeeper, but the goal stood.\"I think this is preventing an opponent from being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the line of vision,\" Joe Hart said on Match of the Day. \"As it leaves his foot, Trossard is in [Guglielmo] Vicario's line of vision. Offside in my opinion.\"The key consideration for the VAR is that the offside players are moving away from the play, and the goalkeeper can see the ball at the time of the shot.For many fans it feels like it should be offside. Supporters want just decisions, but VAR has never really been about that. It is about checking the validity of the on-field decision.\"Two of those goals were given,\" Hart said of the goals scored by Nottingham Forest and Arsenal. \"So it makes it very difficult and we have these continual conversations, but with VAR the ability they've got is to slow it down and pause it, and you can point out why the goal should be ruled out.\"At what point is the threshold crossed for a player making a clear impact on the goalkeeper? The only way you could end these discussions is to make a decision objective, but we should be wary of unintended consequences.Would we get more consistent decisions? No doubt, but as we have seen with the handball law if you add more absolutes that simply results in more disallowed goals.How about saying that a player being offside in the six-yard box always has to be impacting a goalkeeper? You would still have shades of grey and potentially goals disallowed which are against the spirit of the law.If the offside player is at the opposite side of the goal to the keeper, would we really want a goal to be ruled out? If you are being objective, it would have to be.That does not feel like a road we would want to go down, which leaves us still with a subjective conundrum.VARs are told not to get involved in subjective offside unless a clear error has been made either way. This is why interventions are quite rare, and the borderline decisions like Andy Robertson at Manchester City cause most controversy.Last season, there were only two VAR interventions on line of vision, and they both resulted in disallowed goals being awarded: Bernardo Silva for Manchester City at Wolves and Jamie Vardy for Leicester at Fulham.Supporters will understandably use these for comparison but while two decisions can be similar they will never be exactly the same. For that reason, we will always have perceived inconsistencies.Vaughan confused by 'amateurish' England plans before second Test.

The mother is staying at the same premise but the parents have limited access to the children, their family lawyer said.The fate of the children, known in Italian as the Bimbi nel Bosco or kids in the woods, has captivated the country. Tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition to reunite the family.“The family unit lives in housing hardship as the building has not been declared habitable,” the order states. “The members of the Trevallion family have no social interaction, no fixed income, the home has no toilet facilities, and the children do not attend school. The order is based on the risk of violating the right to social life in consideration of the serious and harmful violations of the children’s rights to physical and mental integrity the parents should be suspended from parental responsibility.”Giovanni Angelucci, the family’s lawyer, says the family heats the home with fireplaces and uses solar panels for light and to charge their devices. The family removed running water to avoid microplastics as well as costs and instead draws fresh water from a well on the property. They don’t have an indoor toilet but instead use an outdoor composting toilet.Trevallion told local media at the time he was shocked by the decision. “They are happy, smell good, well-mannered, and well-fed; why break this bond?” he said Friday, according to La Repubblica newspaper. CNN reached out to the family via Birmingham’s website, which advises that they don’t check electronic communications often.Birmingham runs a life coaching and energy reading business, according to her website, which is filled with images of animals and the children – photos the court order said violated the children’s privacy and were posted only to show the appearance of a normal living situation after the social services’ investigation began.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and her deputy Matteo Salvini have both criticized the court decision. Meloni, who said the removal of the children was “alarming,” has called the Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio over the case, according to her spokesman.Salvini, who plans to visit the family home next week, told reporters at the Venice Bienniele on Friday that it was “shameful that the State is concerned with private education and the personal life choices of two parents who found Italy a hospitable country, yet it steals their children.”Giuseppe Masciulli, the mayor of nearby Palmoli, also condemned the removal of the children. “I’m a father myself, so I was deeply shocked by the situation,” he told CNN, adding that he believed the situation could be resolved if the family promises to meet certain requirements, including reinstalling running water and meeting with the local school on a weekly basis to assess the children’s academic progress.",

Every game is a milestone. It's good. It means every season we've been there. It's a huge competition. It's special for the players. To challenge yourself with the best teams in Europe is incredible, a huge experience. For the club, in terms of reputation, prestige and financial issues it's massively important.\"Man City manager Pep Guardiola on how his side will move on from this weekend's defeat to Newcastle:\"It's immediately forgotten. We thought about what happened but it's of massive importance that we have our way in the group stage.\"Now we start the last four games. Two at home, two away. Tomorrow third in the table in Bundesliga. Massively important game to finish in the first eight and we need tomorrow and one more point we will be qualified for the next round.Man City manager Pep Guardiola faced up to a lot of questions about his reaction to the refereeing of Saturday's defeat at Newcastle.He said that he apologised to the cameraman that he spoke to after the game, adding that he felt 'embarrassed\" and \"ashamed\" of his behaviour.\"[Rodri] not long but not sure when he will be back. We will wait a little bit more to make sure he is fine.\"Pep Guardiola says his Manchester City players have to move on from the disappointment of Saturday's Premier League defeat at Newcastle.He starts by saying Rodri and Mateo Kovacic will not be available for tomorrow's game, but everyone else is.Guardiola added that Rodri would not be out for long, but he does not know when he will be back fit enough to play.\"I don't know. I still consider, I decided to be a manager because of Pep's team in Barcelona. Any club, any teams can decide the way they want to play. I chose mine years ago, and this will be the way I like to watch my team play football also in the future.\"I don't think anyone can be compared to that Barcelona team, to Pep. They changed football in Spain, where every club was trying to play that way. When Pep moved to Germany, everyone was trying to play that way. Germany national team also won during those years.\"Pep came to England, and other clubs tried to do something similar. England, in terms of the international team, also did something similar.\"Pep Guardiola said last week that the season starts now following the conclusion of the last international break of the year.But this period of fixtures started in a disappointing manner with a Premier League loss at Newcastle on Saturday, when Manchester City were on the wrong end of three refereeing calls.They can return to winning ways in the Champions League on Tuesday when they host Bayer Leverkusen, knowing victory will strengthen their position in the all-important top eight.The Spaniard faces the cameras this lunchtime, with defender Josko Gvardiol also scheduled to be in attendance.He may have finished his news conference, but we still have a few more lines to bring you from Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca.\"He is going to be an important player for sure for this club, no doubt. The most important thing for Estevao is that he has to enjoy fully, he has to be happy, and not think about being better than this player or another player, but only think about himself and try to be a better than himself day by day, try to work hard, improve and for sure he is going to be a top player for this club.\"Enzo Maresca has stopped talking now, but stay on the Chelsea stream to listen to Spain defender Marc Cucrella.\"Personally, I think we are a better team compared to the day we played Bayern away. But every game is different, Barcelona use different weapons to attack and defend, so it will be a completely different game. But for me personally, the team is getting better day after day.\"\"For sure, he is a fantastic player, he showed all his life that he does the most important thing in football, which is scoring goals. We are going to try our best to defend him, which is by being aggressive.\"But it's Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal, Fermin Lopez, Frenkie de Jong, they have so many players, but at the same time we have so many players that can try to win the game.\"\"Estevao is already playing a high level, starting already with Brazil. For sure, he is very young, for sure, he can do many things better, but we are very happy with him. Now, for me, it's more or less the same thing I said about Pedri, it is nice for people who love football to watch players like Estevao, Lamine Yamal, Pedri - this is the beauty of the football. We are happy Estevao is with us and for sure he is going to do well.\"Enzo Maresca says Estevao is going to be as important for Chelsea in the future as Lamine Yamal is for Barcelona now.\"You know me because you are in my press conference. When you ask me what happens in three or four months, I don't know. In this moment, I am very happy to be in this huge club, one of the best clubs in the world, and this is the most important thing.\"Manchester City Champions League news conference.

They're not going to beat America and China in scaling up these AIs.\"So, what can you do? You can embrace the idea that you can do something different. And that involves being a little bit more brave.\"He argued that \"something that Wales could do is to do what I'm trying to do - create an environment in Wales where companies and the academic institutions feel like they have the resources, and the freedom, to start doing much more differentiated research\".While consumers have access to AI services on their smartphones, businesses in Wales are already racing to integrate time-saving and productivitiy-enhancing technology into their operations.Google hosted an AI event with the UK government in Cardiff to encourage companies to see the benefits of adopting the new technology.\"AI is not one thing, it can be used in so many different situations,\" said Business Secretary Peter Kyle.Some of the businesses at the event \"are doing work on film sets, they're doing work in the lived environment... and on digital transformation,\" he added.\"If this is incorporated throughout the economy, it has a transformative impact on the economy. It means that more of the mundane tasks are taken away, a lot of the running of the business is actually expedited,\" Kyle said.AI growth zones have been announced in north and south Wales, while the Welsh government's AI Plan for Wales promised to ensure artificial intelligence could be used to \"drive economic growth, enhance public services... and equip people across Wales with the skills to thrive\".It includes a commitment to invest in AI innovation and skills in the public sector, and to develop ethical guidance for using the technology.Any expansion of AI research and development in Wales would require investment by universities and government.But the computing power required to process and host AI services would also need a power grid which isn't currently available in all parts of Wales.There have been considerable protests against plans to increase electricity grid capacity in mid Wales, due to the operator's intention to erect pylons across rural areas.\"Mid Wales is chronically under-served by modern grid infrastructure,\" said Stuart George, chief executive of Green GEN Cymru which is attempting to build the pylons.Despite fierce opposition in some areas, Mr George argued the roll-out of a more reliable electricity grid was essential in order to supply existing and future demands.\"What we need to be better at is telling the story of the benefit that can come from this,\" he said.\"When you look at what the future will look like - electric vehicles, electric home heating systems. The ability for businesses to decarbonise and also grow and develop within mid Wales is currently impossible.\"Mr George warned Wales could \"lose out\" on the AI race if it did not have the infrastructure to attract data centres and research facilities, and said politicians needed to make difficult decisions.Commitments to decarbonise the electricity supply meant \"the grid infrastructure that is required to unlock that renewable energy is an inevitability, and that means that they have to make the big decisions and they have to make them quickly\".While Mr Jones' research is focussed on the future of AI, he had a recommendation for dealing with the present wave of AI chatbots.The training of AI models was leading them to give answers that please the humans who are interacting with them.\"This means that a lot of people can become misled by the fact that you can tell [the AI chatbot] almost anything, and they'll just say, 'yes, you're right, that's brilliant, that's such an amazing idea.'\"So we need to fix that problem, we need to make AIs that can actually disagree with you, and actually correct you.\"As AI-generated music floods streaming platforms, questions bubble over whether listeners are owed more transparency.Appearing from the Vatican via video, the pontiff spoke to youth attending a Catholic conference in the US state of Indiana.The accountancy giant says artificial intelligence will eventually lead to fewer entry-level positions at the firm.Thousands of earthquakes were caused by magma \"pumping through\" Earth's crust for three months, they say.",

Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.Thanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.\"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps.While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.Both sides say \"intensive work\" will take place on outstanding issues following talks on a US-backed plan to end the war.Police are investigating allegations that Jacob Zuma's daughter, Duduzile, lured men into fighting in Ukraine.",

    "details": "There's a new song doing the rounds, and in the immortal words of Kylie Minogue, you just can't get it out of your head.But what if it was created by a robot, or the artist themself is a product of artificial intelligence (AI)? Do streaming sites have an obligation to label music as AI-generated? And does it even matter, if you like what you hear?A survey published last week suggested 97% of respondents could not spot an AI-generated song. But there are some telltale signs - if you know where to look.AI music became one of last summer's hottest topics after accusations the band The Velvet Sundown were AI-generated sent them viral.The band, who had no record label and a minimal social media footprint, quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of monthly listeners on Spotify after releasing two albums just weeks apart - and the music world grew suspicious.The band initially denied the claims, later describing themselves as a synthetic project \"guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced and visualised with the support of artificial intelligence\".Internet sleuths were suspicious of the band's airbrushed photos, which featured non-descript backgrounds and a warm orange filter.There was also no record of them having performed live – no glowing reviews from fans posted online, nor any concert photos or videos. The band members had not given interviews and did not appear to have individual social media accounts.Looking into the real-life and social media presence of an artist can be one helpful indicator of whether or not they are real. But experts tell the BBC that fast-developing, sophisticated technology means it is increasingly hard to know when a song has been made using AI.Now, an entire song can be summoned rapidly with a single prompt, sparking what industry experts have described as an \"explosion\" of AI music, sometimes referred to as \"slop\" - on streaming platforms.A song with a formulaic feel - sweet but without much substance or emotional weight - can be a sign of AI, says the musician and technology speaker, as well as vocals that feel breathless.AI songs tend to stick to generic verse-chorus structures, and usually don't have a satisfying ending. AI is also more likely to create lyrics that follow a correct grammatical structure, says Rich, whereas some of the most beautiful or memorable words penned by humans don't always make sense.Just ask Alicia Keys and her \"concrete jungle where dreams are made of\", or The Rolling Stones and their flirtation with double negatives in (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\"If it doesn't feel emotional, it's a really big part,\" the former BBC Click presenter continues. \"Does it create that tension and resolution that is a fundamental part of the music that we love? Does it have a story inside it?\"Another tell-tale sign is unrealistic levels of productivity. Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, describes how one artist was recently believed to be AI after dropping multiple soundalike albums simultaneously.\"This will be fine for background music for most people,\" she continues, \"but it won't work for creating the superstars of the future who, of course, draw on the past but then make something completely new out of it.\"Sometimes, what might stand out is a song that sounds almost too perfect, lacking minor flaws and variances.This could mean no strain in the vocals, and overly polished production, according to Tony Rigg, music industry adviser and lecturer in music industry management at the University of Lancashire.He adds that odd phrasing, unnatural emotional delivery, and lyrics that feel generic or repetitive can also be clues.\"AI hasn't felt heartbreak yet... It knows patterns,\" he explains. \"What makes music human is not just sound but the stories behind it.\"It's also worth paying close attention to the vocals. AI \"singers\" often sound a little slurred. Consonants and plosives (hard sounds like \"p\" and \"t\") aren't quite right. You might hear \"ghost\" harmonies, where backing vocals appear and disappear at random.However, Rigg calls these signs \"hints not proof\", acknowledging it is not very easy for the casual listener to detect AI-generated songs.As well as being used to generate full songs, AI is also becoming a tool some established artists are using to support their creativity.There currently isn't any obligation – or consistent way – for artists to let fans know if and how they are using AI.And artists including Imogen Heap and Timbaland have created AI personas and released singles under their names.She created the voice model as a chatbot - a \"desperate attempt\" to keep up with a deluge of messages and requests including from fans - but more recently, it has featured on several songs and allowed Heap to take part in more collaborations than she otherwise would have due to time constraints.While \"it does sound different if you really know my voice\", she says she has put a lot of work into making the AI version of her voice sound human and doesn't think listeners would be able to tell.But she hopes if people feel a human connection to the song, without already knowing part of the vocals are sung by her AI model, they might reconsider any preconceived negative ideas or fears they have about AI.She says she isn't against using AI to actually create music, but it's just not something she's got around to doing yet.Heap believes there should be more transparency around what goes into a song, and how AI has been used.Citing the example of someone reading the label of a microwave ready meal so they know the ingredients, she says: \"We need that for music, and we need that for AI.\"There is currently no legal obligation for streaming platforms to label AI-generated songs, despite increasing calls for them to signpost such tracks.In January, the streaming platform Deezer launched an AI detection tool, followed this summer by a system which tags AI-generated music.Deezer says its detection system can flag tracks made with the most prolific AI music creation tools, and is working on expanding its ability to detect music made by others. It says the risk of false positives - eg incorrectly flagging a track created by a human - is very low.Manuel Moussallam, Deezer's director of research, says his team was so surprised by how many tracks were flagged up by the detector when it first launched they were \"pretty convinced we had an issue\".In September, Spotify said it would roll out a new spam filter later this year to identify \"bad actors\", and prevent \"slop\" being recommended to listeners. In the past year, it has removed more than 75 million spam tracks.It is also supporting a way to enable artists to say where and how AI was used in a track, through a system by a consortium of industry members called DDEX. This information will be included in the metadata of a track and displayed on its app.Spotify says it is about recognising listeners' desire for more information, as well as \"strengthening trust\".\"It's not about punishing artists who use AI responsibly or down-ranking tracks for disclosing information about how they were made.\"Some believe the presence of AI is irrelevant – engagement is driven by enjoyment, and music people love is already serving its primary purpose.Artists have shared deep concerns around the impact of AI, and hundreds of musicians including Dua Lipa and Sir Elton John have protested about the use of their songs in the training of AI tools.For LJ Rich, the use of AI in music raises many \"weird and beautiful ethical questions\" which remain as yet unanswered.\"Like if the music makes the hairs on the back of your neck go up, does it matter if an AI wrote it or not?\"You can find many different music playlists for dogs and cats online.

But what if it was created by a robot, or the artist themself is a product of artificial intelligence (AI)? Do streaming sites have an obligation to label music as AI-generated? And does it even matter, if you like what you hear?A survey published last week suggested 97% of respondents could not spot an AI-generated song.  But there are some telltale signs - if you know where to look. AI music became one of last summer's hottest topics after accusations the band The Velvet Sundown were AI-generated sent them viral.",

The agents have also been criticized over their use of force against both US citizens and non-citizens, including shootings, tear gas and flash bangs.Around half of New Orleans’ immigrant population is from Latin America, according to Census data. And immigrants’ share of the population is smaller than in other cities where Bovino has led arrests.But organizers and immigrant workers told CNN they’re the backbone of the city, helping maintain the service industry that welcomes millions of visitors each year. They cook the Creole and Cajun food that makes the city a culinary destination, and they clean the hotel rooms that host tourists visiting for Mardi Gras.Now some of the city’s immigrant workers feel afraid they too will be caught up in the Trump administration’s sprawling deportation campaign.Trump administration ‘inadvertently’ deported transgender woman to Mexico despite judge’s concern she may face torture thereAt Tia Maria’s Kitchen, Jose Almendares strives to make authentic Honduran food the way his mother taught him: Baleadas made from handmade tortillas filled with beans, cheese, crema and avocado; fried sweet plantains; and pastelitos stuffed with fragrant meat and potatoes.But in the past week, they’ve been short-staffed as employees say they’re scared to come to work with rumors of Border Patrol in town. On Saturday, which would usually be bustling, Almendares had to close early because there weren’t enough staff to cover the evening shift. He’s trying his best to make up the difference himself, working extra hours to fill the gaps in staffing.For immigrants in the city, there’s “a lot of anxiety and uncertainty, because you’ve seen what’s going on in other cities,” he said. “And a lot of people are scared and they’re hiding.” He’s given his crew informal trainings on what to do if they’re stopped by federal agents, teaching them about their Fifth Amendment rights and urging them to always call a lawyer if needed.The tension is personal for Almendares: He’s a Honduran immigrant who is protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. “I’m choosing not to live fearful or scared, I know my rights,” he said.Ingrid Ferguson, who owns five grocery stores with a focus on Central American products in New Orleans, says she and her family have had to pick up extra shifts because their immigrant employees are scared to come to work — even those with work permits.Daily revenue has dropped by almost half in the last week, she said, a change she attributed to lower foot traffic as Latinos in the city — the core of her customer base — are hunkering down at home. She’s started offering free delivery, her way of “trying to do what we can do.”She’s considering temporarily closing all but one store next week if the staffing problem continues — a devastating step for the business she spent nine years building.“Every single day I’ve been working so hard to get to this point,” she said. “To close the doors — it’s going to be very, very hard.”Coming to the US and building a flourishing business to support her family, “I realized my American dream,” she said. But now, “we don’t feel safe and don’t feel good anymore to be here … We want to, you know, not feel that they’re gonna come and catch me when I open my door.”And the Mexico-born owner of a construction company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing worries she or her family could be targeted by DHS, told CNN several of her contracts are effectively paralyzed as the immigrant employees she usually works with are frightened to report to work.“Obviously the people are so scared,” she said. And as a Spanish-speaking “brown” immigrant herself, even though she has legal status, she’s worried she’ll be targeted.Her company focuses on stucco and plaster, she said, which requires specialized workers, many of whom have been honing their skills for years. It’s impossible to replace them on short notice.Lindsey Navarro, the founder and executive director of El Centro, a nonprofit that helps members of New Orleans’ Latino community open businesses, said she expects the restaurant and hospitality sectors to be most affected by staffing shortages ahead of the upcoming operation.At the same time, Navarro said she’s been heartened by an upswell of activism as the city braces for the operation. Residents are learning from the strategies used in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, where locals mobilized other community members, training them on how to respond if they observe immigration enforcement actions.Text messages and a moved SUV: How the government’s case against a Chicago woman shot by a Border Patrol agent fell apartTaber, the organizer with Unión Migrante, said the organization hosted free immigration consultations with lawyers and helped people sign power of attorney letters and custody forms in case parents are separated from their children. Organizers helped immigrant parents of US citizen children apply for passports for their children, too, in case they need to travel to be reunited.Gonzalez told CNN, “This city is filled with people who have deep culture, deep roots in organizing.”Immigrants “are an integrated part of this city, absolutely, and most people right now are thinking about how to support them, how to help them,” he said. He added the distrust in the government left after its botched response to Hurricane Katrina has created a culture where residents look out for each other. Federal aid took days to arrive as tens of thousands of people were stranded without food or water in the aftermath of the storm.“This is a city that is very accustomed to the federal government abandoning it when its people need it the most,” he said.New Orleans has been on the administration’s radar for months, with President Donald Trump floating the idea of sending in the National Guard in September. A Border Patrol operation there would follow Charlotte as the latest Democratic-led city in a Republican-led state where Bovino has led targeted, intense immigration enforcement efforts.“We’ve got a great leadership team that we work for that we look to for leadership and that would be President Trump, (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem, and all of those folks,” he said. “We pay attention to what they say, and we pay attention to what our intelligence says. We marry those up, and we hit it hard.”The Crescent City and surrounding region is familiar territory for Bovino, who led the Border Patrol’s New Orleans Sector during Trump’s first term. The sector includes hundreds of miles of Gulf Coast across half a dozen states.The city’s mayor-elect Helena Moreno, a Democrat born in Mexico, told CNN affiliate WWL she’s watching closely as the operation looms even as she’s received little information from federal officials.“You have parents who are scared to send their children to school,” said Moreno. “At my church,” she said, “there is a one o’clock service, Spanish-speaking service every Sunday, that keeps getting smaller and smaller. People are really, really scared.”Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has encouraged stronger immigration enforcement activity in the state and city.“New Orleans is a place under which we’ve had illegal criminal activity, alien activity,” he said in an interview on Fox News last week.Speaking about Kenner, a New Orleans suburb, he added, “when ICE is ready, we certainly welcome them to come into the city and be able to start taking some of these dangerous criminal illegal aliens off of our streets.”Marco Balducci, a New Orleans-based immigration attorney, said that the operation “isn’t about public safety.”“They keep invoking public safety,” he said. “But I think that it’s a pretext. If this were about public safety, then you would use criminal law enforcement.”Balducci said the anxiety is palpable among his clients. “We have a lot of experience down here preparing for natural disasters, and it kind of feels like that, but it’s different in that it’s like actually a siege,” he said.Navarro, the executive director of El Centro, said the fear of arrest or deportation was especially powerful for immigrants who came to the US fleeing persecution or violence in their home countries.Many Latino immigrants to the city “come here with the belief and trust that this is a place where what they endured in their countries won’t happen again,” she said. “And so for that to be happening again to them, it’s so disappointing.”CNN’s Karina Tsui, Dianne Gallagher, Priscilla Alvarez, Taylor Romine, Chris Boyette, and Michelle Krupa contributed to this report.",

But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming.Many people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.\"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system.Vitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds.However, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\".But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit.Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help.The likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.Professor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water.All three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress.Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly.",

    "details": "Pollution been an issue for so long in the Indian capital that the city’s famous Red Fort is turning black, an outward sign of a growing health and political crisis that’s now bringing angry residents onto the streets.The struggle to clean India’s air stands in contrast to nearby China, where a multi-billion dollar and years-long effort to crack down on the country’s notoriously polluted skies has paid significant dividends.New Delhi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government insists it’s taking action, and last month launched an expensive – and unsuccessful – cloud seeding experiment to wash away the toxic air.Pollution levels are now at “hazardous” levels, according to IQAir, which regularly puts Delhi at the top of its list of major cities with the world’s worst air quality.Small aircraft hummed over the city’s skies late last month, firing flares into clouds to shower them with small quantities of silver iodide and sodium chloride compounds.India has used cloud seeding technology to create rain in other parts of the country, but never to curb pollution. It’s part of a pricey promise made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which took office in New Delhi earlier this year.“I want to tell Delhi’s citizens that the government has installed anti-smog guns on high-rise buildings, done dust mitigation with water sprinklers, we are monitoring ongoing constructions,” environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in a statement.Three attempts at cloud seeding last month “did not achieve success” because there wasn’t enough precipitation in the air, according to Manindra Agarwal, director of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, which worked with the government on the cloud seeding project.Two more trials were planned; however, they’ve since been postponed, partly due to insufficient moisture in the clouds, IIT Kanpur said in a statement.“Effective cloud seeding requires specific cloud conditions, which are generally absent during Delhi’s cold and dry winter months,” experts said in a letter to the environment minister.“Even if suitable clouds were present, the dry atmospheric layer beneath them could cause any developed precipitation to evaporate before reaching the surface,” said the letter, from the Indian Meteorological Department, Commission for Air Quality Management in the national capital region (NCR) and Adjoining areas and the Central Pollution Control Board.“This is honestly the worst possible choice to mitigate air pollution,” M Rajeevan, former secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences told CNN. According to Rajeevan, even if the cloud seeding had succeeded, it was only a temporary fix, reducing pollution for a couple of days instead of tackling the root of the problem.“Given the alarming air quality situation in Delhi, studying important monuments like the Red Fort is crucial for promoting effective conservation policies and interventions.” the study said.“Of course, the fort has gone black,” said Raman, 64, who only gave one name, and has worked at the fort for four years.“How will it not with the level of pollution in Delhi? There’s so much dust. After just a day of being outdoors, you go home and wash your face you see how much black stuff comes off.”A petition was filed in India’s top court earlier this month asking that air pollution be declared a “National Public Health Emergency,” and calling for the court to supervise a new anti-pollution strategy, so it’s carried out in a timely manner.Filed on behalf of Luke Coutinho, a wellness expert who has spearheaded Modi’s Fit India movement, the petition accuses the government of failing to target the sources of industrial pollution and spending too little to curb vehicular emissions.“Temporary measures such as mist sprayers, anti-smog guns, and artificial rain trials may provide symbolic reassurance but do little to mitigate emissions at the source,” the petition said.Prasad does not discount the importance of individual responsibility. “My neighbors had just had a baby and were burning crackers to celebrate. I wanted to go and tell them at least for the sake of your baby you should not be burning crackers at all,” she told CNN.The India Gate protest did not last long; Protesters, including women and children, were detained for not having permission to demonstrate. Some said they were forced into police vehicles and were later released on the outskirts of Delhi. CNN has reached out to Delhi Police for comment.As Delhi’s air pollution levels deteriorated from “very poor” to “severe” on last Tuesday, the government implemented increased pollution control measures as part of its Graded Response Action Plan.Under this measure, schools up to Grade 5 operate in “hybrid” mode – with some classes online and others in-person. All non-essential construction is paused, and the most polluting vehicles are banned from the roads while the measure remains in force.Protesters say they’ve sent multiple requests to meet Delhi’s chief minister, all of which have been denied. They say the government’s refusal to engage with them has brought them to the streets, and they’re not backing down.“We’re here protesting because it’s our responsibility to speak up,” said Prasad, the doctor, at one of at least three protests held this month. “I hope the government listens.”",

    "details": "In my many years as a journalist, I never thought I would be asking someone how it feels to have trout sperm injected into their face.The lower part of her face is being injected with tiny fragments of DNA, known as polynucleotides, which have been extracted from either trout or salmon sperm.So the hope is Abby's body will not only welcome these tiny strands of fish DNA, her skin cells will be spurred into action, producing more collagen and elastin, two proteins which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of our skin.For Abby, the aim is to freshen her skin, keep it healthy, and hopefully, treat the acne she's lived with for many years by reducing scarring and redness.Polynucleotides are being touted as the next big skincare \"miracle\" and are rapidly gaining popularity after a number of celebrities have spoken candidly about their \"salmon sperm facials\".Earlier this year, Charli XCX told her nine million Instagram followers that she felt \"fillers are kind of over now\", and explained she had moved onto polynucleotides, which are \"kinda like deep vitamins\".Kim and Khloe Kardashian are also reportedly avid fans. And when asked about her skincare routine on a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jennifer Aniston responded: \"Don't I have beautiful salmon skin?\"\"We are having a Benjamin Button moment,\" Suzanne Mansfield, who works for aesthetics company Dermafocus, tells me.While such an effect is highly unlikely and would probably be a tad disconcerting, Ms Mansfield says polynucleotides are forging the way when it comes to regenerative skincare.A small but growing body of research and clinical trials suggest that injecting polynucleotides can rejuvenate skin, not only making it healthier but potentially reducing fine lines, wrinkles and scars.\"All we are doing, by using it in the aesthetics industry,\" she says, \"is enhancing something the body already does. That's why these are so special.\"\"Just one area left,\" Helena Dunk, the aesthetic nurse practitioner who owns the clinic, Skin HD, reassures her.\"Half my clients really notice a huge difference - their skin feels more hydrated, healthier, younger - while the other half don't see such a big change. But their skin does tend to feel tighter and fresher.\"Abby has already had the area under her eyes injected as part of a three-course treatment at the clinic - and she's really pleased with the results.She received lots of tiny injections of polynucleotides, which was a \"pretty painful procedure\", but says it's helped reduce the dark circles under her eyes.While a growing number of studies consider it a safe and effective treatment, it is still relatively new and some experts warn the hype may be outpacing the science.Consultant dermatologist Dr John Pagliaro, based in Brisbane, Australia, says that while we know that nucleotides play an important role in our bodies - they are the building blocks of our DNA for a start - he questions whether \"injecting salmon DNA, cut into little pieces\" into our faces is going to work as well as our own nucleotides.\"We do not have good, strong data,\" he says. \"As a medical specialist, I would want to see at least a few more years of big, credible studies showing safety and efficacy before I started using them in my practice.

    "details": "Marine litter is a major environmental problem. Abandoned containers and fishing gear can trap or strangle animals, and plastic waste can break down into microplastics, which can release chemicals into the water that get into the food chain. Some research suggests that eating microplastic might even interfere with plankton’s ability to store carbon at the bottom of the ocean, which could impact climate change.A team of researchers and students is trying to change that — with an autonomous diving robot that can detect and retrieve litter from the seabed.The Smart Grapple, developed at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), in Germany, uses an AI system to identify individual bits of trash using an onboard camera or, in murky water, sonar imaging.Stefan Sosnowski, head of the research team at TUM, says the cable also aids the robot in bringing heavy items up to the surface.“We can use the cable as basically the cable of a crane, and then the winch can pull up the system, which is more efficient than the little robot trying to swim things up,” he explains.Nicolas Hoischen, a doctoral student at TUM, who has worked on the Smart Grapple for two years, says “the most satisfying part” has been seeing the robot in action.“Because of course then you’re projecting back two years ago, when you had a single arm, or maybe some small joint, and then you see the full grapple and it’s really breathtaking and amazing to see, in two years, how far we can go,” he says.Hoischen was drawn to the project because he wanted to find a positive, real-world application for his research into robotic systems.“It’s not just a fun project to work on here at the university… but also a project that might then also help ports, and countries in general… to get rid of this rubbish,” he says.“It’s not the solution to all our problems with marine litter,” Sosnowski cautions, adding that we can’t simply continue to litter the oceans and rely on robots to pull it out.“[But] in some specific areas, like harbors or natural reserves, where you might have a lot of ecological pressure on a specific area, I think there, robotic systems will definitely help,” he adds.The Smart Grapple has been demonstrated at the Port of Marseille, in France, and the Port of Hamburg, in Germany, where it successfully retrieved a wide array of litter — from car seats to an intact cloth handkerchief.“In part of our trials [the technology] is still also remotely controlled, simply because we’re still in the process of setting up the system and kind of figuring out all the kinks. But the functionality is such that we can also let it run completely autonomously,” says Sosnowski.He explains that one of the most difficult challenges in developing the Smart Grapple was getting the system to correctly distinguish between waste and non-waste.“What you have to do, really, is tell the system what is rubbish and what isn’t,” he says. To do this, the Smart Grapple was trained on images of underwater objects, labelled by TUM students as either litter or natural. “By that, [we] train the neural network to recognize what we want to collect,” he explains.",

    "details": "Marjorie Taylor Greene’s shock announcement of her exit from the House of Representatives after a feud with Donald Trump shows the president still has power to punish challenges to his authority in the Republican Party.But if his quest for total loyalty means Trump ignores the substance behind the complaints of the Georgia representative who was once one of his fiercest supporters, then he will lead his party down a risky road.Given her apparent disgust with politics, her party and Washington in general, it might be wise to take her at her word. Still, her X post, along with a video and the long statement in which she made her announcement Friday, didn’t sound like someone who is leaving public debate or “America First” principles behind.Whether Greene’s future lies in a conservative media role or in a political campaign, she took positions on Social Security, health care, immigration, foreign policy and the national debt that sound very much like a manifesto for a back-to-basics shift for the MAGA movement when Trump has left the scene.Greene’s falling-out with Trump has created so much interest because it’s a fracture between two of MAGA’s top personalities, but also because it seems to hint at deeper rifts in the movement itself. And since she was once an enthusiastic player in the “toxic” politics pioneered by Trump and for which she apologized on CNN’s “State of the Union” last week, Greene’s turn may hint at a wider fatigue for the drama and bile that Trump whips up every day.► One is that the showdown and her exit prove that Trump’s iron grip on the party is as tight as ever. In this version, Greene will follow Trump critics like former Rep. Liz Cheney, former Sen. Jeff Flake and others who were effectively driven out of public office by the president’s attacks. By turning on Greene, the president demonstrated to every other GOP lawmaker what happens if they cross him.Greene’s distaste for fighting a Trump-backed primary challenge, as expressed in her resignation announcement, will resonate among lawmakers who know the biggest threat to their jobs is losing in a GOP primary rather than in a general election after years of gerrymandering of congressional districts.► An alternative possibility is that for Trump to become estranged from someone who was once as outspoken in his support as Greene, there must be genuine fissures in the party and the movement. The split has coincided with a slump in Trump’s national popularity a year after his reelection; suggestions that he’s becoming a lame duck; and an unprecedented revolt, in which Greene played a leading role, against Trump by the Capitol Hill GOP over the Jeffrey Epstein files.There are likely elements of truth to both theories. It was never realistic that a lone member of Congress, even one as astute in cultivating publicity and controversy as Greene, would prevail in a political test of wills with a president — let alone one who transformed the GOP in his image, created his own populist movement and enjoys an exceptional bond with the grassroots of his party. But Greene argues that the president has departed from the values that took him into office and that validate his appeal. That’s a threat to Trump’s authority at a difficult political moment and a time when the power of second-term presidents often starts to ebb.Making Greene’s life so intolerable that she’s driven out of Washington may represent an attempt by Trump to delay the waning of his political powers. But when revolutionaries start fighting over the meaning of the revolution, it’s usually a sign that their political project is in trouble.And Greene’s critique of Trump runs deeper than policy. She has complained about the impact of his cutting personal attacks on television and social media, warning that he has put her safety at risk, an experience that led her to reconsider her own past conduct. She accused Trump of dropping tens of millions of dollars against her in an attempt to “destroy” her politically. “It’s all so absurd and completely unserious. I refuse to be a ‘battered wife’ hoping it all goes away and gets better,” she wrote in her resignation statement.Greene’s complaints about the impact of Trump’s attacks aren’t getting much sympathy from some of her Democratic adversaries. “I was like, ‘You have got to be kidding me,’” Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas told Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.“You’re on the other side of the president for one week and you can’t take the heat. Imagine what it is to sit in my shoes, to not only be on the opposite side of him, but to have people like her who are constantly fanning the flames of hate,” Crockett said.The Georgia governor’s race is already crowded ahead of the Republican primary. A statewide race might in any case be challenging given the likelihood her extreme political past would alienate moderate swing voters, even if she’s reshaped her image in Washington.Trump insisted that the root of Greene’s MAGA apostasy was thwarted ambition since he’d told her not to run for Georgia governor or US senator. She insisted that she had no designs on any other political positions. But she’d not be regarded a favorite for any step up in Georgia.Moreover, after Greene’s recent tensions with House Speaker Mike Johnson, her departure will make his life even more miserable, narrowing his tiny Republican majority.Trump told ABC News on Friday that Greene’s resignation was “great news for the country.” But perhaps he shouldn’t celebrate too soon. Greene was, after all, part of the coalition that inflicted his most severe defeat by Capitol Hill Republicans, who backed a bill requiring the Justice Department to release the Epstein files — a step he had long resisted. Apart from the humiliation, the new law he signed last week worsened his political headache on the issue.And Greene, channeling the views of voters in a district that she won with a huge majority last year, has forensically criticized Trump. She’s warned that the administration is gaslighting Americans over prices and accused the Republican Party of doing nothing to alleviate the plight of Affordable Care Act policyholders who are seeing the cost of premiums double in some cases. And she’s criticized Trump’s search for a foreign policy legacy as antithetical to the principles of the “America First” movement, which  prioritizes domestic concerns.If Republican voters broadly share her concerns — which are mirrored across a far wider political spectrum than the MAGA movement, according to polls — enthusiasm for party candidates could dip to dangerous levels in the midterm elections.Trump’s attempts to address the affordability crisis have been lamentable: He’s claimed that Americans struggling with the cost of living are living in an economic golden age. It’s not hard to see that Greene is far more attuned to the reality of much of the country than Trump, a billionaire who lives a gilded lifestyle and surrounds himself with wealthy acolytes and sycophantic officials.There’s also something deeper to Greene’s recent comments. She diagnosed a political system that is failing millions of Americans. She argued the country’s leaders are negligent in assessing Americans’ most basic needs: on health care, feeding their kids, financing college and offering a viable future in which they can bring up their own young families.",

    "details": "Seven years ago, they were part of a wave of first-time candidates who helped Democrats retake the US House. But their tenures in Congress were brief.Now, the former lawmakers are launching comebacks, running on both affordability issues and the public service and democracy-focused messaging that helped them during the first Trump administration.“There’s a lot of dissatisfaction across the country,” Luria said in an interview. “This administration, these current incumbent members of Congress made lots of promises to the country, to their constituents, and they’ve gone to Washington and done none of it.”But the political landscape they’re competing in will look very different. The number of competitive seats has dwindled, fueled in part by a nationwide mid-cycle redistricting push launched at Trump’s behest. And the party’s base is increasingly seeking candidates willing to push back on the administration, not work across the aisle.“This cycle, it’s about who’s going to stand up and fight for our values against the Trump administration, as it runs a roughshod over them,” said Ian Russell, a Democratic strategist advising state Sen. Kathleen Riebe, a McAdams opponent. “That’s less of an ideological discussion and more of a presentation discussion.”“Out of touch Democrats Ben McAdams, Tom Malinowski, and Elaine Luria are about to be members of the Repeat Losers Club,” Mike Marinella, a spokesman for House Republicans’ campaign arm, said in a statement.The trio’s comeback bids come as Democrats are hoping to build on the electoral wins this month in Virginia, New Jersey and California. While making the cost of living a centerpiece of their messaging, Democrats are once again arguing that Trump poses a threat to democracy and that retaking the House is the best way to check his power.“It’s a more acute version of the same threat that led a bunch of folks who had never run for office before to decide that running for the House of Representatives was the most useful thing that we could do about the danger facing the country,” Malinowski told CNN.This time around, the comeback candidates will have to show they’re the right candidate in blue, not purple, districts. None of the former lawmakers have been able to clear out their primary fields, and they will need to advance through competitive primaries.In New Jersey, Malinowski won the endorsement of Sen. Andy Kim, while Gov. Phil Murphy endorsed another candidate in the race. (Malinowski previously backed Kim during his Senate campaign against Murphy’s wife, Tammy.)Several Democrats are expected to run for the nomination in Utah. And while one candidate dropped out of the Virginia race and backed Luria, Navy reservist James Osyf issued a defiant statement ahead of her campaign launch.“Yesterday’s establishment got us into this mess; they’re not going to get us out of it,” said Osyf, who launched his campaign in July. “This moment demands new leaders who know democracy is at a breaking point and are ready to fight for it – regardless of which way the political winds are blowing.”Luria’s former Hampton Roads district is competitive under the current district lines. But her announcement last week came after Virginia lawmakers began the process of putting a proposal on the ballot next year that would allow them to redraw the state’s congressional map in Democrats’ favor. Though no maps have been released, the seat is expected to become much more favorable for Democrats.“I’m running for the second district as it exists today, and if those lines change between here and Election Day, we’ll adjust,” she said.Luria has already changed one position that dogged her time in office: her opposition to banning congressional stock trading. When she was previously in Congress, Luria called the concept of a ban “bullsh*t.” She said this week that her position has “evolved over time,” and she would now support the current proposal to ban stock trading for members of Congress.“I can see, and I appreciate a lot more now, the absolute distrust that people have in current members of Congress and the government,” she told CNN. “I think this is a small gesture for members of Congress to do to at least make people feel that they can trust in them that they’re not going to use their office for any sort of personal gain.”McAdams, meanwhile, has changed his stance on abortion. While in office, he said he supported the teachings of his LDS faith “that oppose abortion except in cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother’s life and in certain other rare circumstances” as well as the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion in most cases. At the same time, he said that “decisions about terminating a pregnancy should made by a woman in consultation with her physician and others whose counsel she trusts.”He told CNN last week that he would support codifying the protections in Roe v. Wade, which allowed for abortion until fetal viability, due to how much upheaval the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the ruling has called. His campaign said he also no longer supports the Hyde Amendment.The question is whether his ties to the district – he spent years representing parts of the district as a mayor and state senator – are enough to win a seat that’s now solidly blue.All three candidates are banking that there’s still room in the party for moderates, even in districts that can afford to elect more progressive candidates.",

    "details": "President Donald Trump is planning to unveil a new proposal for addressing health care costs as soon as Monday, as his administration tries to avert a spike in premiums driven by the expiration of key Affordable Care Act subsidies, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.The administration’s proposal is not final, and the timing and content could still change, the people familiar with the matter said. In a statement, a White House official said that “until President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the Administration’s healthcare positions is mere speculation.”But the framework under discussion envisions temporarily extending the ACA subsidies in some form, while incorporating a series of guardrails aimed at limiting their scope — potentially including new income limits and a requirement that all enrollees pay some form of premium.Those provisions would address two of the main critiques that Republicans have about the enhanced subsidies, including that so-called zero premium plans drive fraudulent behavior. But it would also set up the ACA for a more fundamental overhaul down the road along the lines of what Trump has been demanding in recent weeks.At the other end of the income scale, the proposal would mandate that everyone pay at least some monthly premium, which is aimed at addressing a wave of fraud spawned by another provision of the enhancement that allowed many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no premiums. Brokers and agents sought to earn commissions by enrolling people in Obamacare policies or switching them to new ones without their knowledge or consent. Requiring that lower-income enrollees pay at least some premium would be aimed at reducing the incentives and opportunities for brokers and agents to commit such actions.The proposal is also likely to include an option for certain enrollees who choose a lower-tier insurance plan on the exchanges to redirect some federal aid into a health savings account, the people familiar said. Trump in recent weeks has repeatedly called for a plan that would divert federal funding directly to individuals to help them purchase coverage, rather sending the money to insurance companies as part of the subsidy program.Answering Trump’s call, GOP Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have rolled out proposals to allow consumers to take at least part of their federal subsidies and put the assistance in health savings accounts. Scott’s plan calls for enabling enrollees to use all the aid to buy coverage, including potentially less comprehensive and less expensive plans outside the ACA. Such a provision could greatly undermine Obamacare’s health.Cassidy, on the other hand, wants to shift just the enhanced subsidies to HSAs and allow enrollees to use the funds to pay for health care services, such as doctors visits, prescriptions and glasses.Meanwhile, a plan pushed by the influential Paragon Health Institute would enable lower-income enrollees to put another set of subsidies that reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses into HSAs to give them more control. Plus, it calls for Congress to once again fund these cost-sharing subsidies, which would lower certain Obamacare plans’ premiums.Several other popular conservative policy ideas could also make it into the framework, such as provisions designed to expand the availability of non-ACA health plans, the people said.Trump is separately expected to call on Congress to codify into law a “Most Favored Nation” drug policy. He has relied on the initiative to strike a range of voluntary deals with pharmaceutical companies aimed at lowering drug costs in the US by tying their prices to lower ones paid in peer countries.",

He's also appeared on stage, and in a number of Ed Sheeran's music videos.He told us he has \"a couple of things\" coming up next year, though he is not able to talk about them yet.But compared with Radcliffe and Watson, Grint has found it relatively hard to break out of his Potter role.Is he fed up of always being linked to a part he played decades ago? \"No, absolutely not, I love it,\" he said.\"It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It's great. It gives me a lot of pride.

I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience,\" he said.Grint said that when the new actors were announced, it took him \"straight back\" to when he, Radcliffe and Watson were cast. \"I still remember every second of it,\" he said.\"I think it's great that it's a whole new thing. It's going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun,\" he added.He wouldn't discourage his children if they wanted to take on roles in the TV adaptation in the future, though.Grint added the films were \"still a little bit too scary\" for his five-year-old daughter, named Wednesday, but she has watched some clips. \"And she loves it,\" he added.As a row grew, the writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.In September, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refused to \"cancel her out\" despite their differences on the subject.Could the future spell a return to wizardry for Grint? When asked whether he would follow in the footsteps of co-star Tom Felton - who recently returned as Draco Malfoy on Broadway - he said: \"Maybe in the future.

The site has issued a statement condemning the attack.“I can anecdotally say that he still performs the role of boogeyman on playgrounds,” Chess told CNN.“I thought it was odd. It kind of frightened me a little bit,” Leutner said of her friends’ fascination with the character. “But I went along with it. I was supportive because I thought that’s what she liked.”As the friendship between Geyser and Weier grew, so did the pair’s fixation with Slender Man, Leutner said. While Leutner didn’t know her friends planned to harm her, something felt off that night in retrospect, she said.“At all of our past sleepovers, (Geyser) always wanted to stay up all night because she could never do that at home,” Leutner said. “But on (the night of) the birthday party, she wanted to go to bed.”Her friends later told investigators they had planned to kill Leutner in her sleep that night but then decided to do it the next morning at a nearby park.When she woke up, they were downstairs on the computer so she joined them for doughnuts before heading to the park. While there, they told her the plan was to play hide-and-seek and asked her to lie down under the leaves and sticks as part of the game, she said.Authorities said Sunday they were searching for Geyser, who was last seen in a residential neighborhood on the west side of Madison, Wisconsin, around 8 p.m. Saturday with an adult acquaintance, police said in a statement.It is unclear how Geyser broke out of the group home or who helped her, Cotton said in a video posted to social media.In January, a judge ordered Geyser could be released from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute, where she spent nearly seven years, the Associated Press reported.In August, a facility in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, declined to take her due to negative publicity they were receiving about the potential move, according to CNN affiliate WMTV, but Madison police confirmed with the news station Geyser is currently living at a group home in Madison, on the same street where she was last seen.CNN’s Chris Boyette, Dakin Andone, Doug Gross, Faith Karimi, Alex Stambaugh and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.",

    "details": "Hidden for decades from public view, the artist's Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer has now sold at auction for a record sum. Why is it so valuable?Undertaken in the opening years of World War One, the portrait's prismatic exaltation of Lederer – the daughter of August and Serena Lederer, one of Vienna's wealthiest Jewish families – can be read as the last glorious gasp of the Golden Age from which it emerged. At first glance, the elaborate array of deceptively ornamental East Asian-influenced motifs – that orbit the young woman in a dazzling timeless stage of celestial blue – and the implosive calm of her dark eyes transport us from the accelerating turmoil of European history, transcending time and place. The audacity of gold on which Klimt previously relied has not so much disappeared as been transmuted, in a kind of reverse alchemy, into a fearlessness of vibrant, evocative colour that borders on the boldness of Expressionism.Look closer and the portrait bristles with teasing and culturally complex details. Within the design of Elisabeth's elaborate robe and gown, Klimt has woven an enchanting conspiracy of shapes. These echo the contours of symbols and forms drawn eclectically from East Asian art and from the world of microscopic medical imagery that was just coming into sharper focus within the scientific circles in which Klimt moved in Vienna. The dragons on her robe are reminiscent of Qing Dynasty textiles, where such creatures represent cosmic authority and the divinely sanctioned authority of the emperor. Their slow, circling movement around Elisabeth's thighs, rising from stylised waves, gives her an almost mythic presence as a tamer of the elements and supernatural beasts. By immortalising Elisabeth's beauty in such mythic terms, Klimt is not simply flattering his patrons. He is, in effect, reinventing Botticelli's Birth of Venus for a new age.Elisabeth's story, both inside and outside the frame of Klimt's mysterious portrait, is one of extraordinary transformation, rebirth and metamorphic survival. Zoom back out from the tight tease of subtle shapes that define the texture of the exquisite garments that Klimt wove for her, and the young woman's very physique seems surreally to mirror the proportions of a butterfly (a recurring motif in Klimt's art) just breaking free from its silken chrysalis. Her colourful gown, falling elegantly behind her, suddenly has the look of slick, prismatic wings about to spread dazzlingly wide. Whether Klimt's late masterpiece is deserving of the astonishing sum it has just fetched, there is little doubting the power and pricelessness of his portrait's endlessly regenerative genius.If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.Find out how the ornate ceramics known as Iznik tiles hold the key to a forgotten golden age of Turkish art.Ancient documents made with washi, the hand-crafted Japanese paper, are proof of its remarkable longevity.Passed down through generations in Gokayama, the Japanese tradition of Kokiriko honours the cycle of life.How America's first professional female tattooist broke through into an art form historically dominated by men.BBC Click visits a simulator lab that allows musicians to practice performance in real-world conditions.BBC Click heads behind the scenes of the Sydney Opera House to explore the tech powering the famous landmark.We find out how AI blurs the line between creation and automation, raising questions about the essence of art.Zeinab Badawi heads to Athens to celebrate the centenary of the birth of opera soprano Maria Callas.Art critic Alastair Sooke travels to Doha to discover some of the treasures of the Museum of Islamic Art.Art critic Alastair Sooke learns about a masterpiece of the Islamic world at Doha's Museum of Islamic Art.",

Gen. Eyal Zamir in a statement after the attack.Hezbollah said the killing of Tabatabai was “a treacherous Israeli attack” on the Haret Hreik neighborhood in Beirut’s southern suburbs, according to a statement Sunday.Images from the scene showed smoke coming from the fourth or fifth floor of an apartment building in a crowded part of southern Beirut.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF had struck “in the heart of Beirut, targeting Hezbollah’s Chief of Staff, who led the organization’s buildup and armament efforts.”Netanyahu ordered the strike based on the recommendation of the Minister of Defense and the IDF Chief of Staff, his office said.“We will continue to act forcefully to prevent any threat to the residents of the north and to the State of Israel,” said Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, adding: “Anyone who raises a hand against Israel — his hand will be cut off.”Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said in a post to social media Sunday that Israel’s targeting of Beirut is “proof that it does not heed the repeated calls to stop its aggressions against Lebanon.” He also called on the international community to “intervene forcefully.”The last strikes the IDF acknowledged carrying out in the Lebanese capital of Beirut occurred in early-June, when Israel said it targeted underground drone production facilities belonging to Hezbollah. Since then, Israel has refrained from striking Beirut, even as it has carried out frequent attacks in southern Lebanon, considered a Hezbollah stronghold.A ceasefire was agreed through US mediation a year ago, but Israeli forces have continued to strike Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa valley.Under the ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah is meant to surrender its heavy weapons and withdraw all personnel from south of the Litani river.There has been little progress on disarmament, leading Israeli officials to warn that military action will be stepped up unless the Lebanese government moves to curb Hezbollah.",

Often the US has supported blocs like the EU and UK.But for many countries, the fact that the talks did not collapse or roll back on past climate agreements is a relief.Antigua and Barbuda Climate Ambassador Ruleta Thomas commented: \"We are happy that there is a process that continues to function [...] where every country can be heard.\"In the final meeting, a representative for Saudi Arabia said: \"Each state must be allowed to build its own path, based on its respective circumstances and economies.\"Like many other leading oil-producing nations, the country has argued it should be allowed to exploit its fossil fuel reserves as others have done in the past.The two weeks of talks were at times chaotic. Toilets ran out of water, torrential thunderstorms flooded the venue, and delegates struggled to cope in hot, humid rooms.On Thursday a large fire broke out, scorching a hole into the roof and forcing participants to rush outside.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva chose the city of Belém to put the world's attention on the Amazon rainforest and to bring a rush of finance to the city.Despite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil was criticised for its own plans to drill for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.Countries at the talks have competing interests, depending on their national circumstances and how exposed they are to the effects of climate change. Some countries were happy about the outcomes.Poorer nations have come away with a promise for more climate finance to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.\"It has moved the needle. There is a clearer recognition that those with historic responsibility [countries that emitted more planet-warming gases in the past] have specific duties on climate finance,\" said Sierra Leone Minister of The Environment and Climate Change Jiwoh Abdulai.UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband insisted the meeting is a \"step forward\".\"We're not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything,\" EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told journalists.With lush trees, bird cries and intense humidity, it was hard to escape the Amazonian backdrop of the talks.Brazil launched the talks with a new fund called Tropical Forests Forever Facility that would pay countries to protect tropical forests. By the end of the meeting, it raised at least $6.5bn from governments, although the UK has not yet contributed.Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

New rules also cap how much the interest rate can rise or fall during adjustment periods.“People have to understand the cleanest way to use an adjustable-rate mortgage is if you know you’re not going to stay somewhere for more than five to seven years, whatever that initial term is,” he said. “Past that, you’re making a bet.”“An economist can’t tell you what is going to happen with interest rates in seven years, so I can’t imagine the average person is going to be able to accurately predict it,” he added.",

    "details": "Musty salt air crept at dusk over the nets and moored boats on northern Mozambique’s coast as seven armed and uniformed men marched into the fishing community last month, demanding the keys to the mosque.Once inside, they commanded – over the microphone used for the call to prayer – that locals on the edge of the port town of Mocimboa da Praia come to listen.It was only when they unfurled an ISIS banner, the mosque’s imam Sumail Issa told CNN, that it became clear who they were. Also palpable was the new-found confidence of the jihadists, emerging in recent months after the chaotic collapse of US aid funding to one of Africa’s poorest countries.“When they called everyone over, as soon as they saw that flag, a colleague and I left, saying we needed the toilet,” Issa said, adding they went to notify the military.The men’s faces were exposed, video posted to social media reveals, and the speech one of them gave was considered – delivering a highly localized manifesto, showing both ambition and independence from other ISIS franchises, analysts have noted.Locals didn’t flee but attentively filmed, the social media video shows. ISIS had made their point about where they could roam, unopposed.However, the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under an executive order from President Donald Trump in January cut some assistance entirely, and drastically reduced other programs, some of which were aimed at boosting the central government’s presence and curbing extremism.On September 7, ISIS began a strident offensive again, hitting its former stronghold of Mocimboa da Praia, beheading dozens of mostly Christian men over the course of several weeks, and triggering the flight of tens of thousands of residents.Over two months, CNN interviewed at least a dozen former USAID officials, dependent contractors, or aid workers and examined extensive internal documentation of USAID’s work in Mozambique, to assess the full impact of the USAID shutdown on one of Africa’s most vulnerable states.USAID also funded projects aimed at reducing ISIS’ ability to recruit. In Mocimboa da Praia, two grants supported projects targeting motorcycle taxi drivers and fishermen – areas of employment where poverty and a lack of opportunity make young men easy prey for the insurgency, according to USAID analysis.A former senior USAID official told CNN: “The abrupt end of USAID programs … opened the door for insurgents to act with greater freedom and impunity.” Studies commissioned by USAID showed the Mozambique insurgency was ultimately fueled by “extreme poverty and marginalization, including an absolute lack of basic services like health and education,” said the former official, who didn’t want to be identified discussing sensitive areas of US policy.The former official said USAID was “working directly to tackle those root causes” – feeding the displaced, helping local officials with schools and health clinics, and assisting young people in finding work.“When those efforts suddenly stopped… it created a vacuum, as well as increased vulnerability and desperation. That vacuum gave insurgents more space to operate, whether through violence or by trying to win over local communities,” the former official said.A State Department spokesperson said in a statement that the US government had continued to provide assistance this year in Mozambique, “a majority of which was life-saving food and nutrition assistance.” The spokesperson said foreign assistance was “constantly under review to ensure it meets the needs of the receiving country and the priorities of the United States.”The State Department did not respond to CNN’s questions about the resurgence of ISIS following the withdrawal of US aid. Its statement added: “The United States continues to be the most generous nation in the world. This Administration is significantly enhancing the efficiency and strategic impact of foreign assistance programs around the world. We call on other nations to increase in burden sharing globally.”In the market, a sense of frustration at vanished opportunities overflows. Motorcycle taxis are a vibrant part of the community, ferrying goods and people around town, but are also targets of ISIS recruitment – their skills equally useful to the insurgency. Aid worker Khamissa Fabaio ran a project, funded by USAID and implemented by international development contractor DAI, which provided vests, helmets and help with paperwork to the “mototaxistas,” improving their livelihood and hopefully steering them away from the insurgency.Anger explodes among the crowd of marketgoers when CNN, accompanied by Fabaio, asks about people’s future prospects without aid. “You’re offending me, things in my house are my business,” shouts one man.“The only way to stop the insurgency is to continue with this funding,” said Fabaio. “It is true that this will not solve the whole problem, but at least it keeps young people busy. Those who go into the jungle (to join the insurgents) do so because they want to save themselves. It’s utter despair.”Fabaio said he had approached some insurgents, whose identities are known in the community, to join his project, and he pleaded for renewed international funding.“That money has benefited us greatly. President Trump is a man who has to have a heart. Not all Mozambicans are corrupt; not all Africans are corrupt.” The project was halted in February with the USAID stop-work order.The violence of the past eight years is so pervasive that its impact seems almost universal. Sufo’s fight to interrupt ISIS is acutely personal. More than six years ago, his two sons and daughter were kidnapped by the group and only the daughter has since escaped.“When I say their names, I immediately remember my children, and I don’t feel good about it. I have nothing to say, just that the situation happened, and how sad it is for me… at this age.”The town’s peripheries show its losses most clearly, the Christian neighborhood of Filipe Nyusi now an empty husk after ISIS night raids caused the community to flee. In early September, small groups of insurgents would trek across the fields into the community and knock on specific doors, survivors said, calling by name on those they had heard were wealthy.Ndinengo re-enacts the scene of Nkwemba’s death, outside a tiny mud-brick home, where USAID food sacks sit, their contents half-eaten on the wall. “He was tied up,” Ndinengo said, putting his arms behind his back, “and they took a stick and beat him. They cut off his head and put it on his bottom.”He shows us the scene of another beheading, where he says a head was left on display. A total of eight men were killed in the raids, seven of whom were beheaded.Nkwemba’s surviving family fled to the outskirts of Mueda, where they live in a rented house, desperately short of funds.His wife, Germane Chiete, described how insurgents asked for her husband by name, leading the family to believe they had been helped by other locals.“I kept quiet and they took me outside and beat me; I fell to the ground and they lifted me up. ‘You have to give us money,’ they said. After tying me up, they took me into the living room, laid me on the floor, while my husband was taken to the yard. They started praying, and then I heard the sound of a jet of blood.”Mueda, a garrison town patrolled by tiny groups of military personnel, used to be a hub for aid efforts. After the USAID shutdown, international aid workers say, up to a dozen of their number suddenly left, and their offices closed.Lianda displacement camp is among the more organized, yet there the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which received nearly half its Mozambique funding from USAID, provides only emergency food relief for newcomers, hoping to see them through a month.Anouk Renard, NRC’s area manager, said: “Even before the USAID stopped, this was already an underfunded crisis. US funding was cut abruptly… So, we had some water provision in the camps that stopped. Some food distributions were suspended.”Aid workers spoke broadly of the damaging impact not only of USAID cuts, but also of reduced contributions from other Western donors.Ulrika Blom, NRC’s country director for Mozambique, called the aid it was able to provide an “emergency response, the response that is given to newly displaced people that are in extreme stress. It is limited funding, and we see now that we cannot help them, and it’s very, very stressful.”Meanwhile Nicholas Wasunna, of UN children’s agency UNICEF, said the cuts meant “we have to make very tough choices. This means we focus on life saving, as opposed to more of the wider livelihoods.”Yet within an hour’s drive of this expanding crisis lies the potential for extraordinary wealth that could transform Mozambique: liquid natural gas (LNG) fields located off the coast of nearby Palma town, itself also wracked by insurgent violence, and increasingly surrounded by private security firms hoping to isolate the hydrocarbon wealth from the chaos of ISIS’s campaign.Yet in late October, Total Energies said it could soon lift its declaration of “force majeure” – a technical term used to describe unanticipated events that might grant relief from contractual obligations – suggesting progress in the field’s development might be nearer. Exxon Mobil has said it will decide whether to progress with its project next year.The Trump administration, while massively reducing aid to Mozambique, has invested in the potential of the Afungi project. The US Export-Import Bank in March loaned $4.7 billion to Mozambique’s LNG entity, to enable it to hire US-based expertise to complete the project.Yet the challenges of launching a complex, multi-billion-dollar gas plant, in the shadow of a spiraling insurgency that has openly stated its desire to disrupt the project, are mounting.",

    "details": "For anyone who loves “Wicked,” it’s easy to get swept up in the magic, the music and the sisterhood between the central pair of star-crossed friends at the heart of the story.But it was also hard to ignore the first film’s political underpinnings, which shine even brighter in the follow up “Wicked: For Good,” in theaters now.Their fragile bond is tested, however, when they come to discover that the feared and respected Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) is, in fact, a grand manipulator who intends to use Elphaba to achieve his goal of silencing the enchanted animals of Oz, who are seen having their rights increasingly stripped away and losing their ability to speak. The Wizard works with Elphaba’s teacher Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) to devise propaganda throughout Oz about Elphaba, thereby bestowing on her the identity of a “wicked witch.”The concluding chapter raises the stakes and leans hard into another scorchingly hot political topic: immigration.In one scene, Boq (Ethan Slater) from Munchkinland goes to the train station to fulfill his desire to travel to the Emerald City and profess his love to Glinda. However, when he gets to the station, he is horrified to learn that animals and Munchkins have been restricted from traveling and need a permit to do so. The policy was orchestrated by the newly appointed Governor of Munchkinland, Nessarose Thropp (Marissa Bode), who pines for Boq.Eric Vetro talks about working with Ariana Grande to prepare for her role 'Wicked' and 'Wicked: For Good.'' Rick Damigella reports.The scene depicts dramatic, harrowing moments in which Munchkins are blocked from being able to move about freely. Later in the film, some of Oz’s animals are seen hidden in a basement within the Wizard’s palace in Emerald City, locked away in cages.The scenes bear eerie resemblance to familiar images seen and stories heard from those affected by the Trump administration’s unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants.McLaughlin did not respond to a request at the time to clarify the nature of those convictions or pending charges.In the world of Oz, the Wizard also highlights groups that he terms as unsafe, at one point saying, “The best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good enemy.”That enemy is the animals, a notion that Elphaba wholeheartedly rejects. And in “Wicked: For Good,” we see her actively intervening against the Wizard’s activities, disrupting construction on the Yellow Brick Road and attempting to spread the word that he is lying to the people of Oz and causing the animals to flee in fear, which we see them attempt to do via an underground tunnel beneath the Yellow Brick Road.Philip Lightstone, who served as a swing and dance captain over two runs of the official “Wicked” national touring production in the US, said he thinks the movies have benefitted from having more space to show various facets of Ozian society that are described in the novel, elements that the long-running musical was never able to delve into.In “Wicked: For Good,” the notion that political power amounts to who has the power to disseminate information – even if the truth behind said information is questionable – comes to a head.“The backdrop really is this political, propaganda, whose truth is real, kind of thing,” Lightstone said. “Whoever’s in control gets to say what the quote-unquote truth is, what’s real.”The weightier scenes in “For Good” will likely in equal measure hit home and stir some backlash, just as the first film did.But those who take issue with the film for getting political, frankly, have greatly missed the point of the work in all its forms.Lightstone recalled that the tour’s directorial team led by Joe Mantello and choreographers led by Wayne Cilento would often use political events to help the company connect to what was happening on stage.CNN has reached out to “Wicked: For Good” director Chu, along with writers Winnie Holzman, Stephen Schwartz and Maguire for comment.Releasing just in time for award season to kick into high gear, “Wicked: For Good” is in solid politically-charged-film company this year.“One Battle After Another,” directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and already at the forefront of the Oscar conversation, follows a down-and-out former revolutionary whose daughter becomes a pawn in a conflict with a demented and racist old foe who is connected to a nefarious underground network. Other buzzy entries that have also hit on political themes this year include Ari Aster’s “Eddington,” a treatise on the pandemic and a lot more, and Oscar-winner Kathryn Bigelow’s “A House of Dynamite,” which angered the Pentagon due to its commentary on the US’s nuclear capabilities and handling of its weapons.Escapism will always come into play for holiday moviegoing, but the prospect of a movie – even one set in the magical land of Oz – inspiring conversation about serious, real-world matters affecting lots of families this season would be a change for, well, good.A previous version of this article contained an error in the description of the train station scene in “Wicked: For Good.” Only the Munchkins were seen barred from traveling.",

    "details": "On the field, players compete tooth-and-nail against one another, often delivering some of the most violent and brutal hits that can be imagined. Off the field, they often regularly rely on one another for guidance as they navigate an almost unimaginable life of athletic stardom.One of the quickest-growing connections throughout the league is in players’ philanthropic efforts, which are on full display in the next two weeks for the league’s My Cause My Cleats event.“I have yet to come across a player in the many locker rooms that I’ve been in through the years that doesn’t have a desire to help, that doesn’t have a desire to make an impact to those less fortunate, or maybe injured, or the widows and the orphans of the world,” Miles Killebrew, a safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers, said.The My Cause My Cleats event is a two-week campaign during which NFL players get to show off a little of their personal style while promoting the causes that are nearest to their hearts. The player-led initiative brings hundreds of personal causes to the forefront and gives each player a chance to show a bit more of their off-the-field personality during games.Austin Hooper, a tight end for the New England Patriots, will be promoting the work his foundation is doing to support kids who are aging out of the foster care system. That work is born out of his own experience with a foster child living with his family when he was a kid.“I don’t really think I’ve actually said this publicly before, but like, a part of me kind of felt a little guilty because I remember growing up when we’re thinking about having a foster care kid come stay with us full time,” Hooper told CNN Sports. “And I remember me and my siblings, we weren’t like against it, but … all three of us were really little, and we kind of felt bad that  we would treat him right, but everyone else in the community would know that he wasn’t our family.“So, kind of selfishly, when I got in the position, I was like, ‘Look, man, you messed that one up big time when you were a little kid, didn’t know any better. You got to kind of try to make this right.’”It’s a chance to show off what Brian Hooks, the chairman and CEO of Stand Together, calls a “philanthropic locker room” – a term he attributed to New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis – in which players can work together to accomplish the goals they’ve set for themselves in their community work. Hooks said his organization has worked with Killebrew and other NFL players to connect them with charities that work in areas that they’re passionate about.“This isn’t about two weeks. It’s not even about what happens on game day,” Hooks told CNN Sports. “This is about a movement, a yearlong, player-led movement that helps people who want to make a difference take the next step, to get engaged in their communities.”While the NFL has other league-wide events – such as Salute to Service early in November and Crucial Catch in October for breast cancer awareness – the My Cause My Cleats weeks allow players to promote their own individual causes.“While we were the ones for years saying we have so many guys who care, and here’s what this person is doing and here’s what this guy’s doing, we don’t have to do it anymore in the same way,” Anna Isaacson, the league’s senior vice president of social responsibility, said to CNN Sports, “because this campaign allows players to have the platform to take the NFL’s marketing muscle and really showcase who they are as humans and what they care about.”The causes that players choose can be born out of life experiences as unique as the players themselves.Hooper’s foundation works with foster children to provide material things – clothes, shoes, laptops, etc. – and provide mental health services.For Killebrew, he’s been working with various charities since he entered the league but is representing Café Momentum during this season’s My Cleats My Cause.Inspired by his parents, the former Detroit Lions safety has always had “a heart to serve.” He was connected with Café Momentum by former Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander and has since fallen in love with the group.“The fact that Cafe Momentum, they take youth who are have some run in with the justice system (and) their reputation … is now tarnished to the world,” Killebrew said. “They take them and say, ‘No, you’re not your biggest mistake.’ They say, ‘You get a second chance.’ And they introduce them to the to the restaurant industry, and they provide them with everything that they need, all of the resources, all of the support to then reinvent themselves.”He added, “It is so cool to see the transformation in these youth when all they have is someone saying that they believe in them. I wanted to be on board with that. That spoke to my heart and aligned with what I really wanted to achieve while I’m in the league, and I’ve been on board ever since.”“It was hundreds of guys from the start,” Isaacson said. “So, I mean, I think we’ve been impressed that it has sustained itself … and every year there is a significant number of players who want to participate. But I think from year one, we were impressed by the number of guys who opted into this campaign.”In a world of extreme attention on uniform uniformity – the NFL has 64 employees whose only job is to look for dress code violations on game day – there is not exactly a lot of room for displays of personality and individuality in the NFL uniform.But being allowed to have flashy, loud shoes for even just a couple games can reveal a lot about the league, NFL senior vice president of player operations Tracy Perlman said to CNN Sports.“This personalizes it for the fan, because fans see, ‘Oh, wait a minute, this player cares about foster care. This player cares about domestic violence,’” she said. “So I feel like it fits in perfectly, because it’s like, here are the pillars of what we do in the community, and here are all of the things that the NFL is touching through players and clubs.”The players enjoy having those moments where they can show off their causes and their personalities.Killebrew said he works closely with the artists who design his cleats and – though he won’t be able to play this year, due to a knee injury that ended his season last month – he was able to show kids working with Café Momentum that their faces would be featured on the cleats.“We’re able to also have the actual youth that we’re representing like on our cleat, and we get to show them like in person,” he said. “We went down to Café Momentum with … (Steelers linebacker) Malik Harrison and (Steelers tight end) Connor Heyward and we were able to go down there and actually show them like, ‘Hey, this is our cleat we’re gonna wear this. That’s you on our cleat.’ And it was just cool to see the look on their face and just kind of that enjoyment, that excitement behind it.”Hooper is a little less involved in the design – “I wear a helmet, they’re the artists,” he said – but loves playing while knowing that he’s representing his foundation.“I wouldn’t say there’s more pressure,” he said, “I would say I actually have more fun. … When you’re out there, you got to be locked in on your job and be ready to get after it. But, I look at it a different way. This is a fun day. I get to do something that normally I wouldn’t do, other than, you know, my plain Jane cleats that I wear, something fun.“And of course, when I got them on, I definitely want to score, for sure – put a stamp on ‘em wearing those.”",

Another elderly person with underlying conditions died in January after a bird flu infection.The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.  Officials also advise using caution when cleaning bird feeders or other areas exposed to bird feces. Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.The Washington health department also recommends flu shots for anyone who may come into contact with domestic or wild birds. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.",

He once again denied that he intended to escape.The document also says Bolsonaro also told the judge he hadn’t been sleeping well and was feeling “a certain paranoia” that stimulated his curiosity into opening the ankle monitoring device.“(Bolsonaro) said he was with his daughter, his elder brother and an aide at his house and none of them saw what he was doing to the ankle monitoring,” the document says. “He said he started to touch it late at night and stopped around midnight.”Bolsonaro’s meeting with an assistant judge on Sunday was procedural to discuss the legality of his jailing, but also provided another opportunity for his lawyers to argue he should remain under house arrest due to poor health. De Moraes has previously rejected similar requests.De Moraes authorized Bolsonaro to be visited by former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro, who was out of Brasilia when federal police agents took her husband into custody.Outside the federal police headquarters, some pro-Bolsonaro protesters held banners calling for Lula and de Moraes to be removed from their posts, while detractors of the former president celebrated his jailing.",

    "details": "While reviewing camera trap footage at Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the conservation biologist spotted an unfamiliar creature around twice the size of a domestic cat in the grainy black-and-white footage.None of his colleagues could identify it; “but, when I talked to the hunters and communities who lived around the park, they knew the species,” Mugerwa recalls.Known as Embaka in the local language, the “cryptic” golden cat was often caught accidentally in forest snares.“That was really concerning for me — that we may lose this species before we even get to know about it,” says Mugerwa.“They’re really, really difficult to see in the wild,” says Mugerwa, who won the Indianapolis Prize Emerging Conservationist Award earlier this year for his work on the species.But, realizing that accurately counting the big cats was the first step to protecting them, he set out to conduct the first population census across the species’ range, expected to publish next year.Together, they launched a standardized camera trap survey across the cat’s suspected range, supported by funding from the National Geographic Society.At the same time, US-headquartered nonprofit Panthera, another of Mugerwa’s collaborators, was developing an AI algorithm that could quickly sort the images and identify individual cats based on their unique coat patterns, similar to how tiger stripes are used like fingerprints.“That’s really important, because now we are able to speak to number and density,” says Mugerwa, adding that without AI, distinguishing individual cats would be nearly impossible due to their small size and subtle markings.Establishing population numbers was just the first step. Early in his research, Mugerwa realized that hunting was the cat’s primary threat.“We are dealing with a bushmeat crisis: the level of hunting ongoing in this forest is unsustainable and out of control,” he says, adding: “The species is being pushed to the edge of extinction in many of its range countries.”To combat the cat’s biggest threat, Mugerwa went directly to the residents, creating Embaka: the first community-based anti-poaching conservation project focused on the African golden cat.“We have learned a lot from local communities; the range expansion, for instance, some of that data comes from hunters,” says Mugerwa. Embaka offers incentives like dental care and livestock support to encourage communities to “speak out against hunting” and protect the forest ecosystem.Bringing reformed hunters on board not only reduces the threat the cats will face from hunting, but it also “improves the relationship between the African golden cat and the communities,” says Mugerwa.“It also allows the local communities to own and to be part of the camera trap grid, which is really beautiful to see,” he adds.",

    "details": "The Jouberts were in the bush in the Okavango Delta, when a buffalo, a creature they had extensive experience with, knocked Dereck down, before impaling his wife. The horn entered under her arm, passing through her chest, lacerated her neck and went up into her face.“Beverly died in my arms twice and I was able to pull her back,” Dereck Joubert told CNN. “Then again in the medical plane, then again in the hospital.”“I shouldn’t have survived,” Beverly Joubert  reflected. But the incident, far from causing the couple to withdraw from the wild, only reaffirmed their commitment to protecting it, she explained.Now they have compiled Beverly Joubert’s photography into a hefty art book titled “Wild Eye: A Life in Photographs.”There are the expected photographs: perilous wildebeest migrations and languorous leopards. There are also the remarkable and sometimes shocking images. For instance, Beverly Joubert’s photographs of lions successfully hunting elephants at night — the first time it had ever been documented, the Jouberts believe.The couple documented the behavior after years of research — a luxury that wouldn’t be afforded to many photographers, and certainly not those who parachute in on assignment.“That’s our life,” said Dereck Joubert. “These things are happening all around us, all the time … We’re the first to see it. If some new behavior starts emerging, you don’t read about it in some scientific paper. It takes time. There’s no magic sauce here except time.”For her husband, it embodies what makes an image iconic. “It’s a question mark,” he said. “What happened before this? And what’s going to happen next?”Nature documentaries often have a penchant for anthropomorphism; transposing human-like narratives on animals. While saying there’s a need to stop short of defining the inner lives of their subjects, Derek Joubert argued, “it’s folly to avoid the notion that animals are like us in some way.”“They’re mammals like we are,” he added. “They have brains, they have reactions. Think about elephants: they have the ability to think (of) the past, present and future; to communicate … Many of these sacrosanct emotions are indeed not unique to us.”“One can respond to that in one of two ways,” said Dereck Joubert. “One is to go, ‘The world is burning, it’s finished.’ Or, ‘What can we do about that?’”Proceeds help support the Great Plains Foundation, which oversees the Big Cats Initiative and other conservation programs.“What we do with our work as emergency conservationists is look for opportunities within this ever-changing world to regrow and to rewild,” explained Dereck Joubert.One opportunity is through animal translocation, moving animals from high density to low density areas in Southern Africa — a solution becoming increasingly necessary as safe spaces for animals are fenced off, and in some cases, required to maintain genetic diversity.The alternative is culling, and “conservation with a bullet is not a form of conservation,” said Beverly Joubert.“I think our life’s narrative … needs to be built on care and compassion and being kind to everything around us — elephants, school children, old grandmothers, rhinos. I think too often in our society we discard people in need,” said Derek Joubert.The career retrospective book is a natural opportunity to look back on their lives. What advice would they have for their younger selves?“Embrace life, be curious and speak out,” said Beverly Joubert. “Speaking out is so important. If you do not speak out, animals — everything around you — will disappear.”“I would say to little Derek, ‘Do it all again, exactly the way you did it the first time around,’” said her husband. “You’re going to get dented. You’re going to get bruised. You’re going to get knocked by elephants. You’re going to get run over by buffalo. You’re going to crash a number of airplanes. You’re going to have scorpion stings, snake bites. Don’t change a thing; it’s been a perfect life.”",

    "details": "EDITOR’S NOTE:  This CNN Travel series may have adjacent ads by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos, in compliance with our policy.It’s only taken a few hundred years, but the “Spice Islands” region of eastern Indonesia — now known as the Maluku Islands — is once again attracting attention.Virtually off-the-grid for global travelers just two decades ago, the archipelago and its hundreds of islands, along with several surrounding regions, are now on the bucket list of travelers craving new and unusual adventures at sea — all complemented by modern, high-end amenities.Filled with astonishing biodiversity, he says they offer a true sense of remoteness that can only be explored by boat.“It’s a place where coral reefs explode with color, volcanoes rise from untouched seas, and ancient cultures thrive in isolation,” adds Friedman.“Every island tells a different story, with traditions and languages found nowhere else. There’s simply no other place on Earth that feels this wild, authentic and alive.”Carolyn Coenen, an Asia-Pacific regional specialist for Wilderness Travel, says the region has become increasingly popular with people “who want to be blown away” by the insane amount of underwater life.“Coral reef fishes that you wouldn’t see elsewhere and in large quantities,” she describes. “Just an overload to the senses.”“With Aqua Blu, we made a deliberate choice to offer an intimate, yacht-style experience rather than a traditional cruise,” says CEO & founder Francesco Galli Zugaro.Guests can spend more time in the water or exploring ashore, without the feeling of being on a timetable, he adds.“We designed the vessel and the itinerary to feel relaxed but highly curated, everything from the dive operations to the cuisine reflects the same level of attention.”Another option is an Indonesian phinisi, a traditional two-masted vessel used for centuries by Spice Islands traders, pirates and fishermen.Lamima’s all-inclusive rate includes unlimited massage and beauty treatments at the onboard spa, as well as yoga and meditation sessions, and an array of watersports gear from jet skis, underwater scooters and e-foil boards to surfboards, paddleboards and kayaks.Michael Travers of SeaTrek Sailing Adventures, one of the oldest tour companies in the region, says businesses offering boat journeys have had to radically change their products over the years to appeal to high-end travelers with sky-high expectations.First and foremost, it offers a blend of sea and land that seems downright unreal. It’s a mosaic of turquoise coves and lush green islands that looks like something generated by computer graphics or artificial intelligence rather than a real-life place on planet Earth.Below the surface are pristine coral reefs that swarm with millions of tropical fish and other denizens of the deep. The islands also harbor unique cultures found nowhere else in Indonesia, small but vibrant societies that blend aspects of both Asia and the Pacific.“The remoteness, the beauty, the resilience and health of the corals, the fact that it’s so hard to get to and consequently all but devoid of tourists. The only way to see it is by boat … it’s just too vast to see otherwise.”The jagged jungle-shrouded karst islands are known for spectacular and colorful birdlife including photogenic species like the red  bird of paradise, Blyth’s hornbill, white-bellied sea eagle and palm cockatoo.“The water is crystal clear in Raja Ampat and this is a part of the world where there is very limited coral bleaching,” says Gerardin.“So you see incredible marine life if you are diving or snorkeling or even from a paddleboard. You hear a noise, you lift your head and see a big hornbill flying out of the jungle. Suddenly you don’t know where to look — up or down!”Many cruises also include visits to Komodo island for an up close glimpse of the world’s largest lizards and bats (flying foxes), or a shore landing on Sumba island to watch local horsemen race along the beach on sturdy little sandalwood ponies.For instance, Wilderness Travel offers six seagoing itineraries in eastern Indonesia on three different ships. Their menu ranges from a popular Raja Ampat snorkeling cruise and an expedition-style voyage between Komodo and Bali to more uncommon journeys like swimming with whale sharks in super-remote Cenderawasih Bay in West Papua and a snorkeling expedition to the Wakatobi islands off Sulawesi.“Dropping anchor at night in places and motoring along during the day and not seeing another boat. You may not see anyone else for several days. That’s one of the things that people really love about cruising eastern Indonesia.”Travers says that despite the growing popularity of the eastern Indonesian islands, there are still many areas that are virtually untouched by tourism.“People come back from our trips feeling changed on many levels,” says Travers. “At least that’s our aim.”",

    "details": "They talked real estate, debated complicated zoning code, and mulled over how to get a utility giant to bring down electricity rates.Then, they talked about what it takes to build housing in America’s largest city and how the health of the five boroughs hinges on the streets being safe.Those were some of the topics New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump covered during a nearly hourlong meeting at the White House last week.Mamdani, who arrived in Washington, DC, for sit-down Friday, made his way through the West Wing of the White House alongside three top aides, senior adviser Morris Katz, press secretary Dora Pekec and his chief of staff, Elle Bisgaard-Church, according to a person familiar with the meeting.When it was finally time to enter the Oval, only Bisgaard-Church was invited. Inside was Trump and his own chief of staff, Susie Wiles.“Our conversation focused on New York City, and I think that is a point of shared focus,” Mamdani told CNN on Sunday. “A point of shared admiration for the city that we both call home, and a city that is in danger of becoming a museum where working people once were.”The meeting then turned into a tour, with Trump taking Mamdani into the Cabinet Room, which overlooks a now paved-over Rose Garden. The room is also home to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidential portrait. Mamdani and Trump posed in front of the painting; Trump flashed a smile and posed with his signature thumbs-up. Mamdani clasped his hands and offered a faint smile yielding a new image — three men from New York who have shaken politics in their own ways.“It was a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani, the new Mayor of New York City!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday, sharing photos of the two after the meeting.When the doors opened to allow cameras into the room, Trump heaped praise on Mamdani, suggesting he and the man he often falsely referred to as a “communist” actually had quite a bit in common.“Some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have,” Trump said while sitting at his desk as Mamdani stood beside him. “We agree on a lot more than I would’ve thought.”It was a surprisingly positive ending to a high-stakes meeting between two diametrically opposed politicians who have spent several months trading barbs.“I can only take one meeting at a time, one conversation at a time,” Mamdani told CNN on Sunday. “All I hoped to do in that conversation was to establish a working relationship and to have a productive meeting that focused on the work itself, focused on the people that many of the two of us know, and people across these five boroughs that we never met.”Mamdani told CNN he spoke to Trump about immigration during their meeting — with the looming question of whether the president will ramp up his immigration crackdown in New York, like he has in some other blue cities.But even without that, the presence of federal officers and enforcement action is being felt across the city’s immigrant communities.Advocates have reported an uptick in apprehensions and targeted operations. In response, immigrant rights organizations have started to organize, distributing “know your rights” pamphlets and training citizen patrols to spot Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and alert people who may be at risk.While Mamdani would not say whether Trump agreed to not increase immigration enforcement in the city, he said he told the president New York City law enforcement is willing to collaborate with the federal government as long as it stays within the existing parameters. New York’s “sanctuary city” rules say local law enforcement are only required to collaborate with federal agencies on immigration enforcement only when people convicted of violent or serious crimes are involved.Trump has previously said he did not believe immigration action had gone far enough when he was asked about officers violently detaining people inside courtrooms and on city streets. On Saturday, the president appeared to back down from his previous threats to send federal reinforcements into New York City, telling reporters he would do so only if the city needs it.Mamdani would not tell CNN on Sunday whether the president agreed with him on how to handle immigration enforcement in the city.“I’ll let the president speak for himself, but I did make very clear that our focus comes back to public safety,” Mamdani said. “Knowing that there may be disagreements between the president and myself, and there will continue to be, and I will always make the case for each and every person that calls this city home.”Mamdani spent the weekend in the capital after his meeting. On Friday evening, Mamdani, a fierce critic of the Israeli government, stopped at a Palestinian restaurant in Virginia for dinner.Back in New York City on Sunday, Mamdani spoke to the congregation at Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church in the Bronx.“My responsibility is to work,” Mamdani told the crowd. “And to do that work means to work with anyone, means to work with those who were opposed to my candidacy, work with those who belong to a different party, work with those with whom I hold deep disagreements.”The comments came after Mamdani earlier in the day doubled down on his attacks against Trump, despite the friendly meeting.On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the mayor-elect was asked to clarify whether he believes Trump is fascist. During the Friday meeting, Trump cut him off, jokingly telling Mamdani it was “OK” to call him one when he was asked the same question by a reporter.“Everything I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” Mamdani responded on Sunday. “I said yes, and that’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today.”",

    "details": "In the chaotic aftermath of Tanzania’s disputed presidential election last month, police and gun-wielding men on patrol shot at groups of protesters, many of whom appeared unarmed or were holding only rocks and sticks, a CNN investigation has found.Videos verified by CNN also support witness reports about the deadly toll of the post-election crackdown, showing morgues overflowing with scores of bodies.Additionally, satellite images and videos show recently disturbed soil consistent with reports of mass graves in the Kondo cemetery, north of the East African country’s main city of Dar es Salaam. Two human rights groups and witnesses interviewed by CNN say the bodies of protesters killed in the past few weeks have been buried there.After the election, authorities imposed a curfew and an internet blackout as people gathered in the streets to contest the exclusion of Hassan’s rivals from the polls. The main opposition party leader, Tundu Lissu, has been in custody since April, charged with treason.When internet connectivity was partially restored a week later, police barred the sharing of photos and videos “that cause panic.” Government officials initially denied any killings of protesters had occurred. Last week, however, the president acknowledged there had been some casualties, but she did not release any figures.Hassan on Thursday launched a commission to investigate the unrest, but also suggested that protesters were paid.In a press conference Sunday, Tanzania’s government spokesperson Gerson Msigwa called the investigation a “biased report” intended to “mislead and incite” accusing CNN of not giving Tanzanian authorities opportunity to respond. CNN sent detailed questions to Msigwa, the police and the country’s ministry of health, but did not receive a response.“If they want to find us, we’re available. We’ll answer their questions. We’re not blocking them from doing their job. But they should do it professionally and fairly,” Msigwa said. The commission of inquiry is in process, he added.The crackdown on protesters has marred the reputation of Tanzania as a stable democracy that attracts millions of tourists every year.The United Nations Human Rights Office, based on information from multiple sources in the country, suggested hundreds of protesters and other civilians were killed, with an unknown number injured or detained.With the help of open-source investigator Benjamin Strick, CNN reviewed dozens of videos and images of civilians lying dead from gunshot wounds, as well as images of bodies overflowing morgues at the Sekou-Toure Regional Referral Hospital in Mwanza and the Mwananyamala Hospital in Dar es Salaam.One doctor, who treated victims of gunshot wounds over the course of four days there and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the dead were brought to the morgue by police “until it was full.” After that, he said, they “piled” the bodies outside the hospital.Many victims, both dead and injured, were young men, the doctor said. “All had sustained gunshot wounds on different parts of the body. Especially the head, abdomen, chest, lower limbs. Badly wounded patients with varying degrees of consciousness,” he told CNN.In Dar es Salaam, a video geolocated by CNN at the morgue of Mwananyamala Hospital shows dozens of bodies covering the floor, piled up on top of each other. Tanzania’s Ministry of Health denied the authenticity of the footage in a statement on social media. The ministry did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.Two minutes later, the scene becomes frantic, according to a video circulating on social media which Strick first geolocated. CNN obtained the original footage and confirmed his findings by analyzing its metadata.In the video, demonstrators are seen running down the road amid bursts of gunfire. One woman wearing a lavender top and a hat, holding a stick and a rock, is fatally shot in the back as she’s running with other protesters. She drops to the ground, blood coming out of her blouse. Other demonstrators attempt unsuccessfully to help the woman to her feet and administer aid.In another video, a woman can be heard asking the mortally injured woman  to wake up. The protesters, in distress, can be heard calling for help.A forensic analysis of the scene shows that the woman was shot from behind: a hole in the blouse, the entry point of the bullet, can be seen shortly after a gunshot is heard. Moments later, the woman drops the stick and stone, and collapses.Sources close to her family confirmed to CNN that the woman was three months pregnant, leaving behind a husband and two children.Rob Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined audio extracted from the original video of the shooting.A few minutes later, a video filmed from the other side of the road shows a protester dressed in black walking towards the police position at the top of the road. Another protester throws a rock, a shot rings out and a different man with a red shirt is seen collapsing, with a visible head injury. The video was first geolocated by Strick, the open-source investigator, and verified by CNN.Another video of the encounter shows the man lying in a pool of blood, still breathing. “Oh my God, this is our Tanzania,” repeats the person filming, along with a Muslim prayer. The man was visible in earlier footage, holding a rock, but he didn’t appear to have anything in his hands when he was shot and killed.The victim was at least 95 meters away from police at the time he was shot, according to an audio analysis by Maher. Both this distance and the one calculated in the video of the shooting of the pregnant woman correspond to the visible location of police at the top of the road, according to CNN’s analysis.An eyewitness to both shootings told CNN the Arusha protest had started peacefully until police started firing at them. The witness saw the pregnant woman being shot in front of her.“I tried to call for help from others to pull her (the pregnant woman) aside because she was still breathing but shots kept getting fired and it hit one young man on the head. It was the most inhumane thing ever,” the witness said. “Someone’s mother died while I and others watched.”In other parts of the country, videos have surfaced on social media of security officers and of armed men in plain clothes – who locals suspect are police – pursuing protesters and opening fire on them. CNN has geolocated several videos showing what appear to be plainclothes officers getting off white pick-up trucks in Dar es Salaam and opening fire in the backstreets of civilian areas.A series of drone videos filmed in the Segerea area of the city, along Tabata Road, shows protesters fleeing and taking shelter in courtyards of a side street, as a white pick-up truck approaches. Armed individuals are then seen getting off the truck and opening fire repeatedly as they roam around a civilian area.The armed men were filmed operating alongside uniformed police officers in the Ubungo area of Dar es Salaam.Viral Scout Management, a local sports management consultancy, released a statement on X saying that seven young soccer players under their contracts were shot and killed at their homes during the protests. The management firm later posted on X that the bodies of six of them could not be located.The woman who recognized her brother in the Mwananyamala morgue footage told CNN the family had not located the body of another of her brothers reportedly shot dead at home in the Mara region.Allegations of mass graves have emerged in the past few weeks, with Chadema, the main opposition political party, accusing police of disposing of hundreds of unknown bodies at undisclosed locations.A video filmed on the ground after the soil was disturbed, and obtained by CNN, shows a series of spots of sandy, overturned soil, that weave between patches of vegetation. The exact reason for the disturbance is unclear. In one area of the fresh soil, what appear to be roots stick out, and atop another is what appears to be a couple of articles of fabric.",

    "details": "EDITOR’S NOTE:  Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series may have adjacent ads by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos, in compliance with our policy.The mountainous Bodrum Peninsula rises over the vibrant blue Aegean Sea, its peak richly forested, its foothills stacked with white flat-roofed homes and hotels.On the peninsula’s exclusive northern coastline, superyachts bob between the ultra-luxury villas and hotels of Paradise Bay. In Bodrum town on the southern shore, traditional gulet sailing boats fill the marina, ready to take tourists on cruises.Today, it’s where Istanbul’s elite come to relax, party, or be pampered, and where international visitors travel for sunshine and sea.They are by no means the first people of means to have left their mark here. From the Leleges to the Mycenaeans, from the Romans to the Byzantines, many civilizations have risen and fallen on the peninsula, leaving archaeological treasures in their wake.Very little remains of the mausoleum today. Today, the biggest historical structure is Bodrum Castle, a huge Gothic fortress overlooking the marina. The region’s importance as a tourism hub is just the latest chapter in its long history of strategic significance.“It’s like a gateway between East and West,” says Orhan Can, a guide with Bodrum Tour, pointing out that even today Istanbul is the best connected airport in the world. Turkey “has always been a place for business.”Artemisia held a grand funeral for her husband, with games and ceremonies. “After Mausolus died, they cremated him,” says Can. Legend has it that Artemesia, the grieving sister-widow, drank her husband’s ashes mixed with wine, which would later become a popular subject for Renaissance painters in the Western world.She succeeded him as leader, becoming a noted naval commander, but outlived him by just two years. Legend has it that her early death was “because she was so sad,” says Can.Newton transported the prize pieces to the British Museum in London, but some original friezes and recently discovered architectural fragments are on display in the park’s small museum.Together, these archaeological puzzle pieces build a picture of life, and death, in one of antiquity’s most thriving harbor cities. Here’s how to follow the treasure trail.Mausolus “built a lot of things back in those days,” says Can. “He made Caria more Greek. He started making people worship Greek gods and goddesses. He started to build temples for them.”His expensive projects earned him a reputation as a tyrant, with finds raised through taxes, including one reputedly on Lycian men’s hair.“He said to them, ‘give me your long hair, or you pay me tax,’” explains Can. “But he wasn’t wasting the hair. He was using them for the wigs of aristocrat Persians.”One of these projects was building defensive walls around the city. Two gates guarded the east and the west of Halicarnassus, with the remains of the western Myndos Gate still standing on a hillside in the Eskiçeşme neighborhood, within walking distance of the theater.To see the remains of a woman who was likely the little sister of Mausoleus and Artemesia, head to the Carian Princess exhibit in the museum’s upper levels.Neither couple had children, so the marriages may have been symbolic. Sibling marriage was not at all common at this time, with incest generally considered taboo.“I think back in those days, for royal people, it was okay to do anything they want to do,” says Can. The general population “were accepting whatever they did.”Intermarriage between the siblings strengthened the dynasty by keeping the bloodline in the family. It also mirrored the mythology of the Greek gods, such as the union of king Zeus and his queen and sister-wife Hera.Ada’s unusual high-status connections don’t end with the marriage to her brother Idrieus. She ruled over Caria twice, with reigns before and after the Siege of Halicarnassus, having being reinstated to power by her adopted son, Alexander the Great.The shoreline around Bodrum is lined with beachside restaurants, beaches and bars, but it’s still possible to leave the crowds behind and ascend into the quiet forests of its mountainous interior. Here, the landscape is much as it was in ancient times.Pedasa is a “hidden gem,” says Can, as is Labraunda, “a sanctuary of Zeus. It’s on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere and it’s like a little Machu Picchu. Idrieus, the brother of Mausolus, built most of it.”Shortly before his death of unknown causes, Mausolus survived an assassination attempt during a royal procession at Labraunda during an annual festival. The ruins are about an hour’s drive from Bodrum, on the other side of Bodrum-Milas Airport.It’s hard to go far in Turkey without tripping over an archaeological treasure, but there are still plenty more wonders hidden underground.The island is fenced off due to uncompleted excavation work, but the city itself is thought to extend underground through Gümüşlük itself.The walls are a gentle gray-blue, like the sea on a winter’s day, and the sand-colored tiles underfoot complement the marble statues and the slab friezes that line the room.A colossal statue of a horse, from the chariot group which crowned the tomb, stands at the top of the staircase with head bowed and muscles flaring.The friezes depict battles between Greeks and Amazons and Greek and Centaurs. In the Amazon frieze, a female warrior prepares to strike a kneeling Greek, while another Amazon appears to cry out for mercy as a caped Greek pulls her back by the hair.In the center of the room are the two statues traditionally identified as Artemesia and Mausolus, both well over eight feet tall. Their poses are relaxed, their tunics and gathered mantles draped over their chest and thighs to their sandaled feet.Artemesia’s face is shattered stone, but above it remains her hairstyle of three rolls of curls under a fitted cap. Mausolus’s head, with its wavy hair reaching shoulders some three feet wide, is largely intact. Under arched brows in a full, handsome face, his deep-set eyes gaze imperiously, thoughtfully, the hint of an Elvis pout curling at his lips.The tomb which held them, the robust structure from which they hoped to stand forever over Bodrum and the blue Aegean, was lost centuries ago to the crashing waves of nature, which wash over all.",

    "details": "Developers with political ties to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser stand to collect millions of dollars more than housing experts say is normal for an affordable housing project.A short drive from the soon-to-be redeveloped RFK Stadium site in Southeast Washington, a red-brick building known as the Ethel has been lauded by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) as the kind of development needed to solve an affordable housing crisis in one of the most expensive regions in the country.The building’s developers are collecting millions of dollars more than housing finance experts say would normally go to developers for such a project — money flowing from a cascade of government subsidies approved by city officials, a Washington Post investigation found.“Bluntly, the taxpayers of D.C. are being screwed by this,” said Kirk McClure, a professor emeritus for the public affairs school at the University of Kansas and a former loan underwriter for the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. He and two other experts who reviewed the financial records at The Post’s request questioned whether the District has adequate guardrails to prevent overpaying developers.The partnership responsible for developing the Ethel is led by Chris Donatelli, CEO of a Bethesda-based real estate development company, and Bryan “Scottie” Irving, founder of D.C.-based Blue Skye Development. Both men are longtime Bowser campaign supporters, and both have repeatedly been among developers who received free or heavily discounted land from the District in return for promises to build affordable housing.Bowser appointed Irving to the board of the D.C. Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA), a local government entity responsible for ensuring that such projects do not receive more funding than they need and that developers are not overcompensated.Albert said in a statement that the Ethel is “a crucial lifeline to at-risk families, offering community services and amenities to teach residents life skills, helping them reenter the workforce, or otherwise putting them on a path to long-term growth and stability.”Donatelli did not respond to requests for comment. His attorney, Paul E. Alpuche, declined to comment. Irving also declined to comment.City officials had long envisioned buildings on the land as a beachhead for further redevelopment in Hill East, an area of modest houses between the Capitol Hill neighborhood and the Anacostia River that has long been home to public facilities, including the now-demolished D.C. General Hospital and the D.C. jail.Local governments routinely subsidize the construction of affordable housing with contributions such as free land, because the obligation to rent units at below-market rates lowers a building’s potential revenue, making it harder for developers to finance a project.Donatelli and Irving received support from city officials for changes that would more than overcome that hurdle.First, they chose to concentrate most of the affordable units in the Ethel, named for Ethel Kennedy, a longtime advocate for social causes in neglected D.C. neighborhoods. That allowed the Ethel to qualify for the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.The project had gone from cash-poor — as most affordable housing developments are — to bursting with subsidies.The land sale and accompanying loan were authorized by John Falcicchio, the mayor’s then chief of staff and then deputy mayor for planning and economic development. Ben Soto, Bowser’s former longtime campaign treasurer, served as trustee for the loan through Premium Title & Escrow, a company he runs that handled the development’s financial closing.Soto said in a phone message that the Ethel’s financing appeared ordinary, and that it is common for someone who handles a closing to serve as trustee for a related loan. Falcicchio did not respond to messages seeking comment.A sale of such land as part of a complex transaction involving federal tax credits is not in itself unusual, the three experts who reviewed the deal told The Post. But a setup under which payments for land essentially gifted by the government go to for-profit developers — on top of a large developer fee — is unheard of, the experts said. A Post review of dozens of tax-credit projects in the District found no other similar case. What’s more common is a local government being repaid for donated land if a project does well financially.“If the answer is nothing, then you have a siphoning situation,” he said, meaning an inappropriate benefit.The mayor’s office offered several explanations for the land transaction. It said the arrangement allowed the project to qualify for a larger mortgage, reduced tax liabilities and rewarded the developers for readying the land for development. The experts who reviewed the deal at The Post’s request said none of those explanations resolved their questions.But Albert acknowledged that the project budget reimbursed the developers for their expenses during the pre-construction phase.McClure, the University of Kansas professor, said the developer fee alone should have compensated for the risk of fronting those expenses. “If the land rose in value, then God bless the taxpayers of the District of Columbia — they should have enjoyed that increase in value,” he said. “That [the developer] puts some money up front, that’s why he gets $8 million in developers fees. We expect him to have to put millions of dollars into this deal.”Christopher Donald, DCHFA’s executive director, and his staffers worked with Donatelli to iron out the Ethel’s financial details, records show.Budgets the city relied on ahead of the Ethel’s construction indicated the higher amount was not needed, and federal law specifies that a project cannot collect more tax credits than necessary for its financial feasibility — a determination DCHFA is required to make.Two weeks later, as the project’s financial closing drew near, a representative of Donatelli sent DCHFA updated budgets that again showed the project fully funded without the higher amount. Still, Donald signed a document supporting the boosted figure, saying it was necessary to ensure “the financial feasibility of the Project.”Donald declined to be interviewed. DCHFA’s spokeswoman, Yolanda McCutchen, did not answer questions about why the agency agreed to the higher tax credit figure, saying in an email that it “was allowable in accordance with federal regulations.” She said Donald’s memo to the board “contained a clerical error,” which was corrected in the second document he signed. She did not say why the budgets that Donatelli’s representative circulated just ahead of the project’s financial closing also indicated the development was fully funded without the tax-credit boost.The higher amount “requires an explanation,” said William Pavão, a former executive director of the California agency that administers federal low-income housing tax credits for that state. “Why are they permitting that?”As the project’s financing came together, ERFSC’s then-executive director, Mae Best, signed a request for the property tax exemption for the Ethel, saying it was indirectly controlled by the nonprofit. The D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) then certified that the project qualified.Diamond, the Georgetown law professor, said the agreement gives “absolutely no control, none” to ERFSC. The nonprofit “has at best an input, collaborative kind of role, not a controlling role,” he said.Best told The Post that her organization was “just one of the community partners” in the development. “We are not the developer,” she said, referring questions to Donatelli.DHCD spokesman Timothy Wilson said the tax relief certification was valid, without addressing the nonprofit’s lack of control.City officials have long viewed the Ethel and Park Kennedy as catalysts for upcoming development along the Anacostia waterfront, an area newly energized by the planned Commanders stadium.Longtime Bowser critic Bill Slover, a former D.C. Housing Authority board member who believes the mayor’s development moves have unreasonably benefited developers, called the Ethel an “egregious giveaway under the guise of affordable housing.” When the project was up for review, he declined to vote on the city’s plan to allocate rental vouchers for use by the Ethel.The worthiness of the project, a visibly incensed Silverman, an independent, said on the dais before the vote, “doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t have the ability to question the subsidy to developers.”“Both the mayor and her selected group of developers think that once you wave the magic wand of affordable housing, the debate’s over,” Silverman told The Post. “That’s sort of how the council deals with it, too. It’s like, ‘Oh, it’s affordable. We shouldn’t question it.’”",

    "details": "A day after Zohran Mamdani got a surprisingly warm reception at the White House from President Donald Trump, who has spent the last few months deriding the New York City mayor-elect as a “lunatic” and falsely labeling him a communist, New Yorkers told CNN they were cautiously optimistic and slightly impressed.“I really don’t like the guy, but I’m glad that he was able to go in there and do a good job with the president,” John Lani told CNN Saturday following a mid-morning run in Central Park. “Maybe we’ll get some funding, we won’t shut down congestion pricing. Maybe we’ll get some stuff for the subway, we’ll see what it does for the state.”Voter data analysis published by The Center for Urban Research at CUNY’s Graduate Center shows the area near Central Park, home to Columbus Circle and the Trump International Hotel, favored former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran against Mamdani as an independent.“I hope everyone’s very successful. I didn’t support either party,” said a voter who did not want to share their name.There is the question of whether Trump will ramp up immigration enforcement and deploy federal forces, like he has in some other blue cities. There are major infrastructure projects that depend on federal funding, and the vast majority of Mamdani’s proposals — like making city buses fast and free, providing free universal childcare and raising taxes on the wealthy — will depend on funding from the state, which is also dependent on federal funds.After watching news coverage of the meeting, Sherry and Steve Cohen, who live in Manhattan, said they wanted to give Mamdani a chance.“I’d like to think that Mamdani is being smart enough to play Trump and praise the man because he needs things for New York,” Steve Cohen said. “Unfortunately, this is what you have to do. You have to bow down, praise him, and walk out and wash your hands after.”Trump, who grew up in Queens and made his name and fortune in Manhattan, remains focused on New York City despite his lack of popularity there. Trump, who conceded Friday he would have loved to be mayor of his hometown, struck an agreeable tone, saying he wanted to help the city instead of hurt it.“Right now, other places need it more,” Trump told reporters. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that, but if they need it, I would do it.”Shelly Payson, who is supportive of Mamdani, said she thought Mamdani had a strategy going into the meeting that worked.“I think that Trump continues to be the most transactional president we’ve ever had, and if people are smart they find a way to give him something which may be meaningless, but it’s important to him and then he loves you and rolls out the red carpet,” Payson said.",

    "details": "The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.Registries currently specify whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.President Donald Trump in January issued an executive order stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.“In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.“When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.“The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents 97% of the U.S. population. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering nearly half the U.S. population.The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.“Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.“Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and stopping specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "details": "He stalked his victims for days, learning their routines before slipping into their homes in a mask to torture, rape and kill. At first, he preyed on women who lived alone but later expanded his attacks to include couples. He pocketed wedding rings, photos and other grim tokens from crime scenes.What started as burglaries and break-ins escalated into brutal attacks and murders that left entire neighborhoods too terrified to sleep. Each wave of terror in a different part of California came with a new nickname: The Visalia Ransacker. The Original Night Stalker. The East Area Rapist. And finally, the Golden State Killer.Once inside the cold and bare interrogation room of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, he slumped into a plastic chair. Alone, he quietly stared at the fluorescent-lit walls for nearly two hours, drawing in large gulps of air.“He reminded me of a sloppy grandpa or an alcoholic uncle whom you avoided at Thanksgiving dinner. He did not seem … particularly menacing,” writes Thien Ho, the lead prosecutor in the case, in his new book, “The People vs. the Golden State Killer.” “The monsters of our imagination can look and feel very different in the bright light of reality.”Detectives offered DeAngelo a can of Dr Pepper – the same drink he’d left behind at several crime scenes. He didn’t touch it nor acknowledge it. Investigators believe he feared he’d leave his DNA on it – unaware that they’d already obtained it from his trash can, said Ho, now the District Attorney of Sacramento County.Ho’s book, released this month, offers a rare look inside the investigation that brought down one of California’s most notorious killers.CNN talked to Ho about the new revelations in his book. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.He was being calculating and manipulative. When he was sitting inside that room for those two hours, I was watching the video of it, and I thought a couple times that the video kind of just froze because he’s sitting there, not moving at all. And after he was confronted with the murders and rapes, he started mumbling to himself, talking to himself, saying, “I didn’t want to do it. Jerry made me do it.”  He was trying to present this mental defense of a split personality … where he was blaming Jerry for taking over and kind of forcing him to do these things.When we caught him, I tried to recreate every aspect of his life, from when he was born in Bath, New York, all the way to his arrest. We found out that in his personal life, he felt … like he didn’t have control or power. For example, when he was a young boy, he witnessed his little sister, who was 8 or 9 at the time, get raped by two military service members, and he was held down and had to watch that. His parents constantly beat him.And … many of the victims talked about how small his penis was. So when we arrested him, … we did a search warrant to take pictures of his penis, and it was micropenis. He felt very small and powerless all his life.And when he became a police officer, it was his way of exerting control and power over other people. When he went in and raped and tied up people, he was drinking their beer, eating their food in their home, violating their marriage. He would take one earring and leave the other behind. He would take the wedding band. And when he would bludgeon them to death … he was playing God over their lives. He had power and control over their lives, because he didn’t have any in his life.After he was caught, we (victim advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors) started reaching out to people and telling them what’s going on. Some people reached out to us when they saw it on the news. We found people across the country … we went to the Midwest and different parts of the country to interview people.We tried to make everything victim-centered – we connected the survivors with counseling services, sat down with them and went over their testimony and prior statements, talked to them about what court’s like and gave them a tour of the courtroom before trial. We prepared them as best as we could to go through that process.A lot of times, true crime books focus on the criminal and the crimes. But here, I wanted to focus on the law enforcement officers that never gave up the search for him, and on the victims.  There’s an amazing moment in the case that I’ll never forget and sort of led me to that … in a criminal case, the victims get to read their impact statement. And one of them was Jane Carson, who retired from the military as a colonel. She wrote her own book on being raped by him.And the Golden State Killer is all about control, and so here was Bonnie, who he couldn’t control because she dumped him. And Bonnie stood there, and they both stared at him. I was six feet away from him. And this guy’s all about control and maintaining control. He’s sitting there, just looking straight ahead, not reacting to anything, trying to maintain control. But when Bonnie was brought into the courtroom, I looked at him, and his breathing had stopped.Carson also told him, ‘Oh, by the way, DeAngelo, do you remember the roast you had cooking in the oven the day you were arrested? … The only roast you’ll experience is when you roast in hell, because that’s where you’re going.’It was the victim and Bonnie seizing control back … you could see there was a reaction. It was a very empowering moment in the courtroom.DNA technology shifted the direction of this case. We took some of the DNA, some of the semen from the Ventura rape and converted into a DNA profile that you use in the genealogy database, and then we uploaded it. We found out he had a distant relative, and so we then took that relative and built a family tree. You know, who was that person’s brothers and sisters, their parents, their uncles and aunties, their grandparents, their great-grandparents. We built this massive family tree with a thousand-plus names on it.And from that family tree, we investigated and looked at everybody. How many were male? How many of them were white? How many of them were police officers or military? How many lived at these crime scenes? And we were able to narrow it down to three people. And lo and behold, he was one of them. We collected his trash and found a piece of tissue that we tested for DNA that matched the killer from all these other locations.The brutality of the murder scenes in Southern California … For many of those murders, he bludgeoned the victims to death with a blunt instrument. A gunshot would draw the neighbors’ attention … (so) killing them with a log, a lamp base or a brass sprinkler head allowed him time to take in the crime scene at his leisure before leaving.I escaped Vietnam on a fishing boat and lived in a refugee camp. When I came to the US, I learned how to speak English by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. Twenty years later, I graduated from law school, and I became a lawyer.I come from a country that doesn’t have the rule of law … it’s governed, essentially, by a dictatorship. And to come to this country, and give back to victims rights, be part of a system of justice that works, it meant everything in the world.He was sentenced to multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and is in a prison in the Central Valley in California. He’s in a protective unit – this is where you put the child molesters, the rapists, the snitches, people who drop out of gangs because other prisoners want to hurt them. He’s not in the general population. And in that unit, he is constantly looking over his shoulder, worried that somebody’s going to attack him.",

    "details": "Arne Slot looks worryingly short of answers as Liverpool's slide continues Darren Staples/AFP via Getty ImagesWelcome to The Briefing, where every Monday during the season, The Athletic will discuss three of the biggest questions to arise from the weekend’s football.This was the round when Arsenal’s Eberechi Eze made history with a hat-trick in the north London derby, Newcastle United earned an invigorating victory against stuttering Manchester City and Aston Villa became the latest, ‘Wow, they’re doing well’ team as they jumped up to fourth by beating struggling Leeds United.Here we will ask whether it’s too early to question Arne Slot’s position at Liverpool, are Mikel Arteta’s side the complete package, and if Daniel Farke’s sacking at Leeds is inevitable.Just when you think it can’t and won’t get any worse for Liverpool, they produce their worst performance of the season.This disastrous run now resembles what City went through this time last year. Liverpool have lost six of seven in the league; City, who were also title holders, lost six of eight in November and December.At this point, it’s important to note that there are no credible suggestions that Slot is losing the faith of owners FSG, who are far from trigger-happy even at the worst of times. It was only six months ago that the Dutchman was being lauded as a genius after his remarkable debut-season title win. He has plenty of credit in the bank.In the Premier League, they next travel to resurgent West Ham United, who have won their last two home games under Nuno Espirito Santo, then it’s Sunderland at home, a team who have already won away at Chelsea and held visitors Arsenal to a draw. They are already in the bottom half of the table and it’s conceivable they will still be there as they head into December.It’s also possible, of course, that they will be in the Champions League positions, given they’re only two points from fifth place, and this is a volatile season.But the most concerning aspect is Liverpool’s lack of competitiveness. It looks like they’ve stopped fighting, like some players have downed tools. It looks like they’re either not fighting for the manager or aren’t listening to his instructions; ergo, temporarily or otherwise, Slot is unable to command the dressing room. Again, that’s purely just what it looks like, in terms of body language and in terms of gifted individual players being miles off what we know they are capable of.Only those in the dressing room really know what’s going on — and also how deeply last season’s players and staff have been impacted by the tragic passing of their friend, colleague and team-mate Diogo Jota in July.“We were just not good in terms of the battles, the challenges, the second ball fight,” their captain Virgil van Dijk told reporters on Saturday. “It’s a very, very difficult situation at the moment.”Slot will surely be Liverpool head coach for some time yet, but as Jose Mourinho and Claudio Ranieri can testify from their times at Chelsea and Leicester City respectively, that goodwill is never infinite.They finished second for a third year running and also got to the semi-finals of both the Champions League and Carabao Cup, but when stars such as Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel and Kai Havertz were injured, they didn’t have enough strength in depth to keep results ticking along. They needed a goalscorer, too.So what did Arsenal do? They addressed those flaws, signing seven players (including Sunday’s north London derby hat-trick hero Eberechi Eze), only two of whom (Viktor Gyokeres and Martin Zubimendi) were guaranteed starters.The difference has been huge. Not only are they the joint-top scorers in the league, but they also probably have the strongest squad, the best team and the best defence.Against Tottenham yesterday, Gyokeres, Odegaard and Gabriel were out, three big players through the heart of the side, plus long-term absentees Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, and yet they walloped the team with the Premier League’s best away record.It was a comprehensive performance which belied the pressure of both a big derby and of taking advantage of stuttering rivals to pull clear at the top of the table. Arsenal have failed on both these fronts in the past, which led to an obvious assumption that they weren’t mentally strong enough to cross the finish line.You can never rule out an unexpected twist. But right now, without an obvious challenger, they look to be enjoying leading from the front.They also won this one without needing goals from set pieces (despite Spurs head coach Thomas Frank’s pre-match assertion that whoever won the dead-ball battle would win the match). Tottenham attempted to smother Arsenal but were just overwhelmed.Right now, the only way Arsenal won’t win this Premier League title is if they bottle it. Right now, they are more likely to streak too far ahead for that to be a possibility.Arsenal are threatening to make winning the Premier League a one-horse race, and the relegation places also have a look of inevitability about them.Nottingham Forest were never likely to stay in the bottom three for long, given their squad, and while West Ham looked a bit ropier, the suspicion was that Nuno would sort them out in time. Fulham remain a bit fragile, perhaps due to Marco Silva’s unclear future, but similarly have a decent squad in terms of ability.So a current bottom three of Leeds United, Burnley and Wolves feels about right, given the quality or lack of in their respective teams and squads.Forest and West Ham acted quickly this season to reverse their slides by sacking their managers, but are Leeds about to do the same?In a bizarre way, getting Leeds promoted was probably the worst thing that could have happened to Daniel Farke. Some fans have never been convinced about his top-flight credentials and it always felt inevitable that the first sign of trouble would lead to him being fired.Five defeats in six games will do that, but it’s also the manner in which Farke has them lined up. Leeds are physical, and try to be hard to beat, but actually they end up being pretty dull. That approach made him vulnerable when results inevitably turned.You do have sympathy for him given the tools at his disposal, though, and you wonder whether Leeds have enough in their ranks to stay up this season, whoever is in charge. A summer of recruitment that focused on tall men and injury-prone forwards always suggested a season of struggle lay ahead.“I want them to feel like the world is falling apart when we lose a game; otherwise, you can’t be a Leeds United supporter,” Farke said on Sunday.",
