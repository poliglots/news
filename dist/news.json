    "details": "The simple act of crossing the road landed gang member Calen Morris in more trouble with the police.He had been wearing his leather patch – depicting a horned skull engulfed in red flames, and the gang’s name “Head Hunters” spelled in giant gothic lettering – at a private party at the group’s clubhouse in late October. He left the event, walked across the road to his car and drove off.Then, Morris said, his house was raided by the police, who he says seized his patch, arrested him and told his partner to flee with their children. They also raided the clubhouse.The legislation was the conservative coalition government’s response to growing public concern over a surge in gang membership over the past decade, which brought the country’s reported gang population close to outstripping its number of sworn police officers.According to gang members, the banishment of the patches is just optics – they’re recruiting new members just as fast as before. And even the police admit the most sinister gang activities are still happening.The government and police both chalked that up as a win for the patch ban and associated anti-gang measures that were introduced, but the data doesn’t actually spell out what offending is gang-related.Parnell did admit it was hard to “draw the nexus” between the seizing of a patch and any change in drug crime or other serious offending like child abuse and sexual assault.That’s because it’s no small thing for a gang member to lose their patch –– under the lore of the subculture, the patch never really belongs to the individual; it belongs to the gang.“It’s so special and sacred to us,” said Edwards. “If you lose your patch there are consequences: you lose a life with us, you get your head kicked in and go back to normal life.”Patches, bandanas and even just specific colors are used by gangs globally to state their presence, protect territory and, when conflict erupts, identify who is who. But patches have an elevated status because they’re usually earned by new recruits – known as “prospects” – for doing certain, often nefarious, tasks.The law covers insignia in broad terms – defining them as any sign, symbol or representation commonly associated with a gang – and it applies to anything it is displayed on, be that clothing, cars, or even rings. But the legislation does not outlaw gang colors entirely, as lawmakers could not ban plain-colored clothing.At a time when indigenous Māori were being uprooted from their ancestral homes as part of an urbanization push, and amid an immigration crackdown on Polynesian people who had moved to New Zealand from the Pacific Islands in search of work and education, gangs – offering fraternity, status and protection – became a draw card for marginalized people.Over the decades, the gangs have become what many would consider an unwelcome part of New Zealand life. Drive down the motorway in Auckland, and there’s a chance your vehicle will be swarmed and overtaken by dozens of bikies out on a weekend ride. Or stop off for a bite to eat in a small town and you might find yourself standing next to a leather-clad gang member ordering a sandwich.The newly established gangs quickly began to grow and muscle in on the drug trade –– building connections with notorious overseas organized crime syndicates, like Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, co-founded by notorious narco Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.Turf wars and renewed rivalries led to gun violence that played out in public, with gang members shot dead in the streets, and the homes of innocent families left riddled with bullet holes after being shot at in the night by gang members who got the wrong address.Assistant commissioner Parnell said reports of communities “feeling overwhelmed by the presence of patched gang members” were not uncommon.But he said the insignia ban had drawn a line and people were now able to “go about their business and actually feel safe… without being impeded by en masse patched gang members.”Wairoa has been beset by gang violence for decades, including some high-profile gang murders. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power have a strong presence.The local mayor Craig Little said there has been “a real big turnaround” since the insignia law took effect. “You’re not seeing gang members walking down your main street or anywhere really.”The gang patches, Little said, were intimidating for some members of the public, particularly visitors to the town. “People aren’t missing them, that’s for sure.”Edwards, captain of the town’s Mongrel Mob chapter, agreed the law has made no real difference to crime. “We’re still out there, out on the street, just less visible –– which, you know, (with) the things that I want to do, that works out quite fine,” he said.The self-described mobster said conflict between the two gangs in the town was still happening, because “some people still needed to learn some lessons.”Gang membership in New Zealand is more than just about being part of a club. Often, it’s a family affair.“I’ve grown up around bikes my whole life. All my uncles are Head Hunters, so it’s just one of those things,” said Morris. “I didn’t think anything of it when I joined the club, I just said: Yo, I’ll join… and I prospected for a whole year.”And it’s the depth of those family ties – which span generations – that make gang membership in New Zealand distinct; it’s not a phase people just grow out of, but more of a lifetime commitment, often from birth.“What a lot of people don’t realize is we’ve created our own culture, our own whanau (family), and that aspect is heavy here in the Hawke’s Bay,” said Edwards, who is also part of a multi-generational gang family.“We’ve got third generation, second generation now,” he said. And because of that, he says he’s trying to focus the attention of members of his gang into things like boxing, rather than fighting on the streets. “We’re all family and the last thing we want is for our families to be doing life (in prison),” Edwards said.That is “a real sad thing,” said Little, Wairoa’s mayor. “Most of the gang members are related in some way or form, so it seems ridiculous that they are fighting each other.”For those without family ties, being in a gang is primarily about having a community of “like-minded bros” to ride bikes and have a drink with, according to Morris. Very few gang members get caught up in real crime, he said.Morris himself has a prior conviction for unlawful gun possession, but claims he is not involved in the organized crime side of gang life.Family, community and the claimed sanctity of the patch are not much of a consideration for the government’s Police Minister Mark Mitchell, who appears confident he has taught the gangs a lesson.“They can no longer behave as if they’re above the law by taking over our streets, intimidating the public, and making a mockery of our criminal justice system,” he said on the anniversary of the law change.State agencies in New Zealand keep a national list of patched gang members and prospects, which experts say is easy to get on, but hard to get off.Parnell, the assistant commissioner, said he expects the number of gang members to come down over the next five years. But the gangs doubt that, saying the ban has had no impact on their pulling power.“There’s more of us. Yeah, you can take my patch off me, but it just doesn’t change anything,” he said.Edwards was accused of wearing his Mongrel Mob patch in public at a tangi – a Māori funeral – earlier this year. He claims that when police came to his home to seize his patch they showed him “paparazzi-type photos” taken from “over in the bushes” on the day of the tangi. “Those are the lengths that they’re going to,” he said.Similarly, Morris said he was filmed by police standing “down the end of the road” when he was accused of breaching the ban.When asked if this was usual practice, police said they use both “overt and covert techniques” to gather evidence. Rather than confronting gang members on the spot, they will opt to take videos and photographs in situations when police know they’re outnumbered, at events that might become emotionally charged –– like funerals –– or if there is a risk to public safety.Police now have specialist organized crime teams in most regions, whose officers act like envoys to gangs and hold talks with senior figures, particularly around managing upcoming gang events, like funerals or sports days, that risk becoming a public nuisance. “We will engage a number of weeks out and set out: these are the rules of engagement,” said Parnell. And those rules are pragmatic. Gang members can wear their insignia on private land, but risk arrest as soon as they set foot on public property –– like roads, footpaths or local sports fields.Some gang members have been arrested for being spotted wearing insignia in public on security camera footage from shops and other videos posted to social media.With so many members’ patches now being seized, gangs are having to rethink the hardline policy of punishing members who lose them. “You don’t even have a chance to fight for it because you’re not home,” said Edwards, explaining that they’re often seized from the homes of gang members after they have been arrested.Even so, the patches and affiliated gang emblems remain “like a code of honor,” said Morris. And new recruits still want to earn them.Just days before his arrest for allegedly breaching the patch ban, Morris proudly showed off his new tattoo –– the Head Hunters gang insignia permanently brandished across his back.“I earned it, like I earned my colors,” said Morris, who likened it to having a customary tattoo. “They tell a story about where we come from, what we’ve been through and what we achieved.”Insignia tattoos are a growing trend among gang members, because the new law doesn’t stretch that far. “I could go walk up and down the street with no shirt on. It’s the same as a patch,” said Morris.",

    "details": "They called themselves the “Women in Red.” Dressed in crimson robes and white caps, they marched with faces downturned in silent protest against Israel’s government in the year before the war in Gaza. Borrowing imagery from Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the group meant to sound an alarm: the government’s judicial overhaul threatened to undo decades of progress on women’s rights.Three years later, what the government dismissed as theatrical exaggeration is increasingly viewed as prescient foreshadowing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government, which relies upon the support of ultra-Orthodox parties, is moving Israel toward a more religious and conservative future.Alongside broader efforts to weaken the Supreme Court – long the cornerstone of Israeli women’s equality – have come specific threats to women’s rights. Netanyahu’s religious partners have pushed bills expanding religious authority over civil life, including gender segregation in cultural events and education. With the power to collapse Netanyahu’s government should they withdraw their support, the religious parties have been able to bend the secular prime minister to their will.“The deterioration in Israel’s gender equality ranking is unprecedented, placing us in the lower half of countries worldwide – a stark contrast to decades in which Israel ranked among the leaders and was known as a pioneer in advancing women’s rights,” said Daphna Hacker of Tel Aviv University’s Faculty of Law and Gender Studies.But Hacker, who also serves as the chair of the Israel Women’s Network, said women are now “virtually absent” from key decisions. “There’s no doubt women’s status has waned in recent years,” she said. “We’ve never experienced such a backlash.”One bill under debate at Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, which could be finalized in the coming weeks, would dramatically expand the authority of state-run religious courts to handle civil disputes. These courts, staffed exclusively by men who rule according to Jewish law, already oversee marriage and divorce proceedings, including for secular couples. Under the proposed legislation, they would gain power to rule on financial disputes, business matters, and potentially child custody issues.“This bill seeks to place women’s fate in the hands of a religious judiciary that inherently discriminates against them,” said Bonot Alternativa, the women’s protest group that once led the Women in Red. “We will not allow the government to force us into marriage with a system that despises us,” it said in a statement while its members protested as gagged brides in chains outside a rabbinical court in Tel Aviv earlier this month.Israel’s rabbinical courts are state-sanctioned religious courts that have legal authority over Jewish family law.They have long been criticized by Israeli women as an arena of disadvantage, patriarchy and inequality, especially in matters like alimony and child support. The Ruth and Emanuel Rackman Center at Bar Ilan University warned last month that the proposed expansion would lead to “serious violations of divorcing women’s rights, potentially the most serious that the Israeli justice system has seen in years.” If passed, the new law would also apply to Muslim Sharia courts.“We will restore what was stolen and return the authorities to the rabbinical courts,” Simcha   Rothman, the coalition chair of the Knesset judiciary committee, said in April. “We need not only to restore the judges but to restore the law to its place.”The Yachin Research Center, a religious think tank in Israel, welcomed the bill as “an important step in restoring the place of Hebrew law.”Moriah, a mother of two girls in her late thirties, has been entangled for over four years in custody and property battles in the rabbinical courts. “In four years, not a single one of my requests has ever been approved – yet every absurd request from the other side was granted,” she said, describing an ordeal that has left her estranged from her two young daughters. Moriah, who opted not to use her last name for her protection, said her visitation rights were revoked, while financial rulings pushed her into serious debt without opportunity to respond or appeal.“It’s an anti-woman institution,” she told CNN, referring to rabbinical courts. “Three male judges sit in front of you, and then the husband and his lawyer, usually a man. You are usually the only woman in the room. It’s a man’s game, built on religious authority, and it’s designed to break you.”Israel is not the only country to reverse women’s rights in recent years. The US Supreme Court removed the protections of Roe v. Wade, and Hungary shut down gender studies programs while explicitly pursuing pro-natalist policies.“This is the worst government for women in the history of the country,” said opposition lawmaker Merav Cohen, who chairs the Knesset committee on the status of women and gender equality. “At best, this government is indifferent to the harm done to women. At worst, it’s actively normalizing it.”“In any normal country, such a situation would prompt the government to declare an emergency, bring everyone together, draft an action plan, increase budgets – because all the warning lights are flashing red.”Cohen said the new rabbinical courts proposal is part of a broader trend within Israeli society of what she warns is a threat to women’s rights, pushed by a religious minority with political power.“The religious system is expanding as far as it can go,” she said. “Israeli women are paying the price of Netanyahu’s coalition and are being dragged back decades.”",

    "details": "But more often in recent years it was Rupert - for many decades the most influential media titan in the world - and his daughter Elisabeth who would make time for each other.She would certainly have room this year to host her father at the luxurious home she has renovated on the edge of the Cotswolds. But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable. Earlier this year, he described his dad as a \"misogynist\" in an interview in US magazine The Atlantic, and referred to some of Rupert's behaviour in the courtroom fight as \"twisted\".He is known to feel betrayed and angered by Rupert's decision to force him, Elisabeth and Prudence formally to cut ties with Fox Corp and News Corp. Driven by fears over the more liberal direction they might want the companies to take after his death, the media mogul tried to change the terms of a trust that gave his four oldest children equal control when he dies.Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise.The judge ruled that changing it was in bad faith. But behind the scenes, the warring sides eventually came to an agreement. James, Elisabeth and Prudence agreed to sell their shares. They have accepted terms that include not being allowed to buy any equity in the family company in future.\"It's a sad ending,\" Claire Atkinson, whose biography of Rupert Murdoch will come out next year, told us on The Media Show.\"These kids worked in the business, they grew up in the business, and the press release said, 'You can't buy shares in this company,' and effectively said, 'Don't let the door hit you on the way out.'\"She also told me: \"This break is extremely permanent. It feels like James and Rupert will never patch up their differences.\"Lachlan Murdoch has been quoted as saying that the resolution is \"good news for investors\" and \"gives us clarity about our strategy going forward\".Fox Corp has seen its share price double under Lachlan and the Trump presidency has brought a ratings bonanza. It raised the amount he had to pay his siblings to get them out - a presumably unwelcome side effect.Despite the payout, Atkinson says, \"There is a fracture in the company and a fracture in the family.\"However much they have felt betrayed by him (and there is no doubt, they have felt it, very painfully), there's an understanding of the dwindling number of years he has left.But Christmas may still be too soon for reconciliation. Lachlan hosted his annual party for the Australian elite at his harbour-side Sydney home earlier this month. Fox Corp may operate out of the US, but he is said to prefer the laid-back nature of Australian life, even if the trade-off is business calls in the middle of the night because of the time difference, as well as a lot of flights.Atkinson says he is popular and well-liked within the business. \"The difficulty that Lachlan has is that he's been in charge for years, but everybody is always going to project that every decision is Rupert's. He's never going to want to say, 'Hey, that's me,' and so I think it's a little hard to come out from Dad's shadow.\"At the same time, Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, says that while Rupert remains a presence in the company \"what's really unique about Lachlan's approach, or what will be unique about his approach, won't fully emerge\".Fox News is the financial cash cow, which may explain Rupert Murdoch's concerns that his children might have wanted to change its political affiliations.Under Lachlan, there's been a successful strategy to expand into digital and streaming, most notably the ad-supported video-on-demand service, Tubi.In September, US President Donald Trump said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch were expected to be part of a group of investors trying to buy TikTok in the US. On Thursday, TikTok parent company ByteDance announced to staff that it had signed an agreement to sell a portion of TikTok to a group of mostly US based investors. Lachlan and Rupert were not named as part of the deal.Presenting the Fox Corporation's results for July to September, Lachlan said Tubi had achieved rapid revenue growth and growth in view time, confirming its position as the top premium advertising-based video-on-demand platform in the US.\"And I'm happy to say Tubi reached profitability this past quarter,\" he added. \"It's a great milestone.\"He also said Fox News had maintained strong ratings throughout the quarter, cementing its status as the most-watched cable network in prime time, and leading to the highest advertising revenue for July-September quarter in Fox's history.\"If you look at the signature deals that Lachlan has made over his career, they have not been designed to increase his political influence. From digital real estate to sports betting to commercial radio to Tubi, Lachlan's investment decisions are focused on the bottom line, not burnishing his political credentials.\"But Prof Benson suggests the significant debt the Murdoch businesses have taken on as part of the settlement with Lachlan's siblings increases pressure to make profit, and therefore to pursue \"politically sensationalistic… outrage journalism\".\"The proven way to be profitable in cable/streaming news is not by becoming more centrist and civil, it's by becoming more extreme, more polarising, and more willing to stir outrage,\" he says.Rupert has had a hotline to major political figures for decades. In September he was on President Trump's guestlist for the state banquet at Windsor Castle. I'm told he spent nearly two weeks in London and was in the News UK office most days.At one point the editor of the Times introduced Rupert to a slightly startled young journalist on the newsdesk and asked him to show the boss the paper's recently launched Live app and what it showed around reader engagement on specific stories.Rupert also spoke to Fraser Nelson, the former Spectator editor now Times columnist, who usually sits at the open plan table in the office. They discussed the company's pivot to video and the work Nelson had been trialling around short form video. Rupert also wanted to talk to his paper's new star about whether Nigel Farage would end up in government.Three months on from the family trust dispute settlement, Mr Manning claims that the Murdochs are \"deeply divided\".\"While Lachlan works closely with his father, I understand he remains estranged from his elder siblings,\" he alleges.Rupert Murdoch and his children Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence were all approached for comment.In her novel Family Business, Anna, a journalist and author, wrote about the rise of a fictional newspaper dynasty and explored sibling rivalry, jealousy and how parental power can negatively impact family relationships. The plot of the book, published while her children were in their teens, follows how a newspaper owner's children are shaped by a parent who turns them into competitors in a power struggle.A decade after it was published - by which time the pair had divorced and Rupert had married third wife Wendi Deng - Anna gave an interview to an Australian women's magazine, during which she was asked which of her children would be best suited to take over from her ex-husband.\"Actually I'd like none of them to,\" she said. \"I think they're all so good that they could do whatever they wanted really. But I think there's going to be a lot of heartbreak and hardship with this [succession]. There's been such a lot of pressure that they needn't have had at their age.\"The family trust, agreed between Rupert and Anna as part of their divorce settlement, was her way of safeguarding her children's futures, by ensuring they had equality after Rupert's death. But that blew up - through a court fight in Nevada and a settlement.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "details": "\"The Pope should tell us how to get to heaven,\" says Romero. \"He has no authority over the government; he has to stay in his lane.\"As a Donald Trump supporter, he is angry about criticism made by the American-born Pope and US bishops about his mass deportation policy.With one in five Americans identifying as Catholic, the Church plays an important role in American life - and politics.Catholics like Vice President JD Vance, and influential legal activist Leonard Leo, were an important part of Donald Trump's electoral success. They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. It was backed by the Pope, who called the statement \"very important\" and urged all Catholics and \"people of goodwill, to listen carefully\" to it.\"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson.\"Many of them are angry. They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"The growing power and prominence of right-wing Catholics in the political sphere is exemplified by JD Vance, a convert to the religion who says his politics are shaped by his faith. Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee.St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\".Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" wrote Ben Sasse.Donna Hughes-Brown has reunited with her family after five months in an immigration detention unit in Kentucky.",

US President Donald Trump also announced a \"blockade\" of all oil tankers subject to US sanctions that are departing from or bound for Venezuela, demanding the return of assets seized from US oil companies years ago.In the past month, the US has already seized two oil tankers, and announced it was pursuing a third.\"Sanctioned oil tankers\" Speaking at a UN Security Council called by Venezuela, US ambassador Mike Waltz said the sanctioned oil tankers \"operate as the primary economic lifeline for Maduro and his illegitimate regime\" and fund \"the narco-terrorist group Cartel de Los Soles\".“Maduro’s ability to sell Venezuela’s oil enables his fraudulent claim to power and his narco-terrorist activities,” Waltz added. “The United States will impose and enforce sanctions to the maximum extent to deprive Maduro of the resources he uses to fund Cartel de los Soles\".",

    "details": "The killing of a Hindu man during recent violent protests in Bangladesh has pushed already strained ties between Dhaka and Delhi into a deeper crisis.As the two neighbours accuse each other of destabilising relations, questions are growing over whether their once close, time-tested relationship is fraying beyond repair.The incident happened as violent protests broke out over the murder of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent student leader, in the capital, Dhaka.Hadi's supporters alleged that the main suspect, who they say is linked to the Awami League - the party of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina - had fled to India, further fuelling anti-India sentiment in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Bangladeshi police, however, said there was no confirmation that the suspect had left the country.In recent days, the South Asian neighbours have suspended visa services in several cities, including Delhi, and accused each other of failing to ensure adequate security for their diplomatic missions.The two countries have also summoned each other's high commissioners to raise their security concerns.\"I sincerely hope tensions don't escalate further on both sides,\" Riva Ganguly Das, a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka, told the BBC, adding that the \"volatile situation\" in Bangladesh made it difficult to predict which way things would go.The anger has grown since Hasina took refuge in India and Delhi, so far, hasn't agreed to send her back despite several requests from Dhaka.In the aftermath of Hadi's killing, some young leaders are reported to have made provocative anti-India statements.In recent weeks, Bangladeshi security forces had to stop protesters from marching toward the Indian high commission in Dhaka.There were counter rallies in India. Bangladesh strongly objected to a protest by a Hindu group outside its diplomatic premises in Delhi, calling it \"unjustifiable\".\"I have not seen this kind of suspicion and mistrust between the two sides before,\" Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, said.He added that both sides should protect each other's diplomatic missions according to established norms.The brutal lynching of Das, a garment factory worker, has only added to the anger on the Indian side.He was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad and was lynched by a mob, who then tied his body to a tree and set it on fire.Videos of the killing were widely shared on social media, triggering outrage on both sides of the border.Bangladesh's interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, said there was \"no place for such violence in the new Bangladesh\", promising that no one involved in the killing would be spared.Analysts say his killing has once again raised questions over the safety of minorities and civil society activists in Bangladesh, with religious fundamentalists becoming more assertive and intolerant after Hasina's exit.Radical Islamists have desecrated hundreds of Sufi shrines, attacked Hindus, prevented women from playing football in some areas and have also curtailed music and cultural shows.Human rights groups have also expressed increasing concerns over rising mob violence in Bangladesh in the past year.\"Hardline elements of society now see themselves as the mainstream, and they don't want to see pluralism or diversity of thought in the country,\" Asif Bin Ali, a Bangladeshi political analyst, said.\"These radical elements are dehumanising people and institutions by setting a narrative that they are pro-India. That gives a green light to others on the ground to attack them.\"Many in Bangladesh suspect Islamist radicals to be part of the mob that vandalised and set fire to the buildings of two Bangladesh dailies - The Daily Star and Prothom Alo - and a cultural institution last week, accusing them of being pro-India.Civil society activists in Bangladesh have criticised the interim administration for failing to stop the recent violence. Even before the protests, the interim government was under scrutiny as it struggled to maintain law and order and deliver results amid the political turmoil.Experts like Ashok Swain argue that right-wing leaders on both sides are making provocative statements for their own benefit, inflaming tension and public anger.\"A large section of the Indian media is also playing up events in Bangladesh and portraying that the country is descending into communal chaos,\" says Mr Swain, a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden.\"People should realise that stability in Bangladesh is key to India's security, particularly in the north-east,\" he says.With the interim administration in Dhaka facing criticism over its lack of control and legitimacy, there is broad consensus that an elected government would be better positioned to address Bangladesh's domestic and foreign challenges.With Ms Hasina's Awami League banned from taking part in the polls, it's widely expected that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will emerge as the winner.There are worries that there could be more violence in the coming days as hardline religious parties exploit anti-India sentiments.\"The biggest victim of this anti-India politics is not India, it's Bangladeshi citizens themselves – like secular minded individuals, centrists and minorities,\" warns Asif Bin Ali.He says the current narrative shows that anyone or any institution who criticises fundamentalists can be \"dehumanised by labelling them pro-India, and attacks on them can be justified\".Former Bangladeshi diplomats like Humayun Kabir feel that India should accept the ground reality and reach out to Bangladesh to rebuild trust.Delhi has already indicated that it will engage with an elected government in Bangladesh and that could pave the way for a diplomatic reboot.Until then, experts on both sides caution that anger on the street must not be allowed to further strain bilateral ties.India’s rural jobs guarantee, a global model, faces controversy as a new law reshapes the original scheme.The fresh protests are sparked by the death of one of the leaders of protests that ousted ex-PM Sheikh Hasina.The five cases in Madhya Pradesh state come weeks after a similar incident was reported in Jharkhand state.",

    "details": "The Justice Department has released a new batch of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – documents that include many more mentions of President Donald Trump than last week’s dump.DOJ released the initial batch on Friday — the deadline for it to make them public after Congress passed a new law last month — and continues to gradually release additional documents.We’re continuing to learn potentially significant things about the government’s handling of the Epstein investigations.The new batch of documents, for example, includes evidence that prosecutors sought to investigate and potentially charge more people.A third cites efforts to locate and serve these people with subpoenas. It indicates some were indeed contacted. One who wasn’t is described as “a wealthy business man in Ohio.”We don’t actually have these memos or the names of the alleged “co-conspirators,” so we don’t know whom these could be in reference to. It’s not clear what kinds of crimes might have been at issue. And while many have been on the hunt for a so-called “client list” that the FBI says doesn’t exist, it’s not clear whether these documents actually implicate others in alleged crimes.We don’t know what happened with these potential prosecutions. The fact that the cases were never charged might suggest that the investigations didn’t substantiate such charges. But the use of “co-conspirators” suggests that, at least at one point, investigators felt others were involved in Epstein’s crimes.And these are the kinds of documents that lots of people have been anticipating for a very long time – documents that might suggest who else might be held accountable for Epstein’s crimes.You can bet there will be lots of pressure on the Trump administration to make sure they get produced.Friday’s initial batch included lots of Bill Clinton but not much Trump. This batch features a much heavier dose of the current president.And perhaps most notably, the documents show how Trump’s name came up in the context of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s investigations and prosecutions. (Trump has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes, and he has denied any wrongdoing.)There are also tips to the FBI involving Trump and his relationship with Epstein, with little or no indication about whether those tips were followed up on or corroborated.Aside from those references, the new document dump features an intriguing apparent reference to Trump.Included is a letter — which the Justice Department now says is “FAKE” — signed by “J. Epstein” and addressed to another infamous convicted sex offender, disgraced ex-USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.“We shared one thing … our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential,” the letter says. “Our President also shares our love of young, nubile girls.”It then suggests that, unlike Trump, “we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair.”Notably, the letter is postmarked three days after Epstein’s death in prison, which has been ruled a suicide. The author alludes to having “taken the ‘short route’ home,” and wishes Nassar, “Good luck!” The letter was marked as “return to sender.”The DOJ statement also noted the letter was postmarked in Virginia, while Epstein had been held in New York; the return address listed the wrong jail; and it was processed three days after Epstein died.Earlier Tuesday, the DOJ didn’t invoke this letter specifically but broadly suggested the allegations raised against Trump – likely including the FBI tips mentioned above – weren’t true.At the very least, the new disclosures are the kinds of things Trump once indicated he worried would unnecessarily tarnish people.The release of these materials previously has been marred by DOJ mishandling, and that’s continuing.First, DOJ’s initial Tuesday statement is extraordinary. It reads as if it’s from Trump’s personal lawyer – i.e. its reference to how this information, if credible, “certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump” – rather than a neutral handler of this information.That’s a huge contrast to how the DOJ handled Clinton’s appearance in the files released Friday. Back then, a DOJ spokesperson pointed to an image of Clinton appearing in a hot tub with a redacted individual and suggestively labeled the redacted person a “victim” of Epstein’s abuse.Clinton, like Trump, has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein. On Monday – before the latest batch was released — the former president’s spokesman encouraged DOJ to release everything it has related to Clinton, claiming that “selective releases” were about “insinuation,” not transparency.The DOJ’s questionable handling of the files has also been underscored by the curious and heavy-handed redactions that go beyond the limits of the law Congress passed last month.And lastly, the documents were apparently uploaded Monday, then removed, then reposted again, according to The Washington Post.It’s not clear why that happened or whether the documents that were reposted match the ones that had been initially been posted.The Justice Department has already failed to comply with the deadline to release all of these documents, which were due in their totality on Friday.And after that initial release, it briefly pulled back some documents that had been posted, including one image that featured a photo of Trump, which was later restored.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said the photo was removed due to caution about potentially featuring an Epstein victim.“It has nothing to do with President Trump,” Blanche said this weekend. “The absurdity of pulling down a single photo because of President Trump is laughable.”",

Denmark stands as its guarantor. I join my voice to that of Europeans in expressing our full solidarity.\"On Tuesday, Trump told reporters the United States \"needs Greenland for national security, not for minerals or oil, but national security. And if you take a look at Greenland, there are Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. So, we need this for protection.\"Adding to the European voices pushing back on the US ambitions and the criticism of Denmark, Commission Ursula von der Leyen insisted that “territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law”. Despite the tone coming out of Washington, she appeared to refer to the US as an ally in arctic security.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez echoed those remarks. \"Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity is central to the EU and to all nations of the world,\" he wrote on X. \"Security in the Arctic is a priority in which we seek to work with allies and partners.\"The US and Denmark are part of NATO, which is supposed to ensure mutual defence in the event of aggression against one of its members. That principle has never been tested by conflict between members of the alliance if one were to seize territory from another.NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has so far remained silent on the issue. During a press conference with Trump in the White House's Oval Office in March, he also chose not to comment after a question from a journalist.\"When it comes to Greenland, if it joins the US or not, I will leave that outside of me in this discussion because I don't want to drag NATO into that,\" he said.",

Zahra's case lays bare this terror: in Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death,\" it said.Another Iranian woman, Kurdish rights activist and social worker Pakhshan Azizi, is also facing the death penalty on the same charge as Ms Tabari.UN experts have previously said Ms Azizi's sentencing appeared to be \"solely related to her legitimate work as a social worker, including her support for refugees in Iraq and Syria\".The changes to the judgement, which was also amended last week, are described as clerical mistakes, errors or omissions.Nurse Sandie Peggie complained about a transgender doctor using a female changing room in a Fife hospital.",

    "details": "The Justice Department’s leadership asked career prosecutors in Florida to volunteer over the “next several days” to help redact the Epstein files, in the latest Trump administration push toward releasing the hundreds of thousands of photos, internal memos and other evidence around the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.A supervising prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida’s US Attorney’s Office emailed the entire district office on Tuesday — two days before Christmas — announcing an “emergency request from the [Deputy Attorney General’s] office the SDFL must assist with,” according to a copy of the email reviewed by CNN. “We need AUSAs to do remote document review and redactions related to the Epstein files,” the email said.The email raises the possibility of more Epstein files being released over the coming days, including the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. It also underlines the public and political backlash the Justice Department has faced since the deadline passed on Friday to release all documents in the federal government’s possession, as mandated by an act of Congress calling for transparency around Epstein files. The Justice Department acknowledged it had not gotten through redacting many of the files by Friday and has continued to release documents this week.The Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions from CNN about the email on Tuesday.The Christmas-week request, from a top career prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office, attempts to entice volunteer attorneys to work on the files now, in exchange for days off later. It’s also possible that the call for volunteers frustrates busy career Justice Department employees after a year of departures and firings across the ranks by Trump administration leadership, as well as several in-court incidents that have hurt the department’s reputation in the legal community.“I am aware that the timing could not be worse,” the US Attorney’s Office leadership wrote on Tuesday. “For some the holidays are about to begin, but I know that for others the holidays are coming to an end.”The Justice Department was using hundreds of lawyers at its headquarters, especially national security specialists, to process the files over the past month, picking up a project the FBI and other agencies had worked on in slivers previously. The Tuesday request appears to seek to add lawyers to the project, more than a month after Congress passed the transparency act and President Donald Trump signed it into law.The redaction guidelines provided by the department have been described by some sources familiar with them as being as being confusing or overly cautious on what is being redacted.Trump has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes, and he has denied any wrongdoing.“We have an obligation to the public to release these documents and before we can do so, certain redactions must be made to protect the identity of the victims, among other things,” the Southern District of Florida leadership wrote in the email asking for volunteers on the Epstein redactions on Tuesday.",

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called it \"a big win for Illinois and American democracy\".The Chicago deployment is part of a series of efforts by the Trump administration to subdue protests against federal immigration raids in primarily Democrat-led cities, including New Orleans, Portland and Washington DC.Trump argues that his use of troops is necessary to quell violence in Democratic-controlled cities, crack down on crime and support his deportation initiatives.But in response to legal challenges brought by Illinois officials and leaders, a lower court blocked the deployment of hundreds of national guard personnel in the Chicago area.The judge ruled against Trump's assertion that the protests in the Chicago area constituted a \"rebellion or danger of rebellion\" against the US.The president appealed against it in the Supreme Court and argued that his decision to deploy the National Guard was not subject to court review. The justice department also asked the top court to allow the deployment while the litigation played out.While the president has been deploying troops to major US cities for months - despite legal challenges - this is the first time the top court has ruled on the efforts.Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die,\" wrote Ben Sasse.",

    "details": "Messages reveal how the agency has raced to satisfy the White House by pumping out videos of confrontations and arrests.For the Immigration and Customs Enforcement public affairs team, the nighttime operation across metro Houston in October was a gold mine.Across thousands of internal ICE messages reviewed by The Washington Post, this kind of celebration has become commonplace. The messages show how the team has worked closely with the White House, which has urged them to produce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.Before officials could post the Houston video, they had to figure out how to frame it. Officials did not know if all the arrestees had criminal records, they wrote in the chats, undermining a slogan the team had worked to promote on social media: that ICE targeted the “Worst of the Worst.”We made several dozen arrests today very quickly. Not sure if these all had criminal histories beyond being in the US illegally.I’d like to try to put this out without focusing on the aliens or their crimes, but to demonstrate that we’re out working hard.Instead of arguing they’d snared hardened criminals, officials wrote a caption saying the arrests showed the dangers of “illegal aliens … behind the wheel.”They settled on a rap song by Nbhd Nick, which his label would later tell The Post was used without permission, that starts, “Oh, you thought this was a game, huh?”For years, this ICE team had run like a routine government communications shop, dispensing public service announcements and news releases few Americans would see. But during President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE’s public affairs arm has rapidly transformed into an influencer-style media machine, churning out flashy videos of tactical operations and immigration raids.The internal communications reviewed by The Post show how the ICE team has coordinated with the White House, working to satisfy Trump aides’ demands to “flood the airwaves,” as one official urged in the messages, with brash content showing immigrants being chased, grabbed and detained.They also show federal officials mocking immigrants in crass terms and discussing video edits that might help legitimize the administration’s aggressive stance. The team also knowingly used copyright-protected music without permission from the rights holders, among other techniques designed to boost their online attention.Six current or former officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, told The Post that the video effort had broken from the more careful and methodical work of past administrations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.The Post reviewed chats and other materials provided by people familiar with internal discussions. They did so on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the disclosures.David Lapan, the first DHS press secretary during Trump’s first term and a longtime critic who has argued the second Trump administration politicized the agency, said the current strategy is unrecognizable compared to the more “professional and buttoned-up” operations under past presidents that worked to describe law enforcement activities clinically and apolitically, for fear of inflaming anger against agents in the field.“We were supposed to present the facts, not hype things up. But this veers into propaganda, into creating fear,” said Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel. “We didn’t have this meme-ification of various serious operations, these things that are life or death. … It’s not a joking matter. But that’s the way they’re treating it now.”White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “President Trump and his entire team are working at breakneck speed to keep our promises, deport criminal illegal aliens, and get information out to the public — that’s a good thing and the American people deserve no less.”DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the White House had given the communications wings of DHS and ICE “autonomy to create content that is effectively reaching the American public.” The social media posts that used copyrighted material without permission had been preapproved by administration lawyers, she said.DHS public affairs officials, she added, were proud to break with the strategies of past administrations because their work has proved more successful at getting people’s attention.Their public affairs divisions employed small teams of video producers, mostly for unexceptional tasks: facilitating TV interviews, running the cameras at workforce retirement ceremonies, recording safety commercials for the Super Bowl. Some producers traveled to make videos when DHS agents took down sex abusers or crime rings. Video producers would film targeted operations, a current DHS official said, but immigration enforcement was only a fraction of the workload.DHS’s media operation was no exception. Public affairs teams were injected with a new crew of political appointees who had orders from the White House to treat immigration as their top priority and produce dramatized visuals of ICE operations and arrests to command user attention, the current and former officials told The Post. The video teams’ workload exploded, and immigration became the only topic anyone could pursue, according to interviews.“We’re not doing child pornography cases. We’re not doing human trafficking cases,” one current DHS official told The Post. “Everything is immigration.”ICE’s public affairs team included several dozen public affairs officers, producers and strategists, scattered between its Washington headquarters and local field offices across the country, current DHS officials said. Members of ICE’s visual communications team, embedded in the public affairs division and known as “viscom,” began recording in the field more frequently, accompanying officers on raids and removal operations, shooting video day and night, interviews and chats showed. Any video producer who witnessed a particularly cinematic scene was expected to alert their supervisors, so the agency and the White House could promote it on their social media channels. Employees on ICE’s “digital engagement” team then raced to edit and post the footage on social media in hopes of securing a viral win.Emily Covington, ICE’s assistant director for public affairs, frequently requested “good arrest videos” and asked the team to devote its energy to capturing “high profile arrests,” the internal messages show. Laszlo Baksay, a deputy assistant director, asked the public affairs team in the chat to flag stories where “aliens with criminal history are being employed,” to counter media reports that the agency was grabbing “ordinary aliens just trying to earn a living.”The team began working like a professional influencer operation, creating a “social media check list” of caught-on-camera arrests, sharing metrics with senior officials, using paid social media tracking tools and cataloguing all of their Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads and X posts, ranked by impressions and engagement rate.Covington pushed the team in internal chats in late May to be more “proactive” in pushing out videos.What PR tactics can we deploy that we don’t typically? Should we feed info to an influencer? ... Using judgment to ID something likely to go viral or bubble up and gain attention. Right now we are learning from the media, let’s feed the beast first with the good work ICE is doing each and every day.A week after Covington’s message, in late May, the team got its first viral video. The clip showed ICE agents leaping out of an SUV and confronting men on the curb of a home improvement store in Baltimore. The men were shoved face down onto the street and handcuffed while an agent said, “Calle la boca” — in Spanish, “shut your mouth.” In an X post, ICE called the video “action-packed.”But the real celebration came shortly after, when the White House reposted the video on its Instagram and X accounts, labeling it an “EPIC Takedown.”The post, from one of the team’s political appointees, led to a burst of hearts and shock-face emojis.As the media operation ramped up, DHS posted several videos containing clear errors around their operations, using misleading footage that showed scenes recorded thousands of miles away from where the video described, The Post has previously reported.Other edits were aimed at presenting events in ways that supported the administration’s narratives. In May, Covington asked, at the White House’s request, whether a video of a deportation flight from Texas could be re-edited so that the clips “don’t feature tons of females?” An ICE official responded that a video producer would “re-edit the b-roll to exclude the females,” the chats show.Officials worked to find ways to describe many of the people arrested as the “Worst of the Worst,” a slogan DHS and ICE began using in January to argue that their agents hunted only the most dangerous criminals. When one official asked in the chat what producers should say in their videos when arrestees had no criminal history, another responded that they should work to find something else “newsworthy” to highlight, like an “egregious immigration history.”Public affairs officers were told to rewrite their news releases and online posts with stronger, more aggressive language if they wanted the agency’s main communications channels to promote them, one said in an interview. “If the truth of the operation does not match the narrative of the ‘worst of the worst,’ it’s going to be killed,” the official said.The team gave right-wing media figures premium access to immigration operations and received favorable coverage. In June, about three months before he was killed, right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk posted what he said was “exclusive footage” of ICE officials arresting a “thug.” Covington highlighted the moment in the team’s chat, thanking one official “for getting great footage on today’s arrest.”A Libs of TikTok representative declined to comment on the relationship. Representatives for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of McGraw said he had been invited by White House border czar Tom Homan to document ICE enforcement in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year.In pursuit of more viral video, DHS brought in new public affairs staff members with atypical backgrounds and authorized them to “go out and capture content,” as a chat message said. A MAGA women’s lifestyle influencer, an L.A.-based wedding videographer and a Canadian-born actor who played a “mountain man” in a cable-TV show joined the team.DHS encouraged the hires to become intimately involved with agency affairs, the chats and interviews showed. In June, when ICE agents were raiding farms in rural Missouri, the former actor noted it would be a prime chance to make a video. “Would be great to get something like that on film,” he wrote in the chats, suggesting a tagline: “We are everywhere, we will find you.”Later, when ICE officials complained about negative media coverage, he worked to bolster their spirits.The good news is half the country is seeing it, and equally as frustrated. those in the “middle” are who we will continue to slowly reach... It’s a war!By June, the public affairs team had for weeks been showing signs of overwork, with some employees consistently working overtime to help satisfy the White House’s constant demands for more content, the chat messages showed.The team had discussed bringing on contract videographers to help address outstanding tasks — like a new request to shadow every operation of ICE’s Special Response Team, the elite SWAT-like unit that handles its most dangerous arrests.All- as expected, I am getting pressure now about our video capabilities. I need ALL video our PAOs and videographers have captured this week ASAP in one link. This should be the only priority for right now.We need all hands on deck to start “flooding the airwaves” per White house direction on ALL ICE arrests nationwide today. The request is to flood social and traditional media with imagery of ICE arrests.The National Guard deployment presented a challenge for a unit trained to cover preplanned and targeted operations: a vast, citywide video shoot where clashes with protesters could flare up at any time.My thought would be for locals to post and the HQ can re-tweet, unless there is something really juicy that would get more push coming from HQ.On White House Call - we need to be highlighting worst of worst LA arrests across relevant accounts/channels. I will be getting a LOT of content from all federal partners today. All flowing through me now.ICE began to post a flurry of tweets on X in quick succession — almost every half hour. They included visuals of recent immigration raids and mug shots of people the agency said were undocumented immigrants with a criminal history.Officials also floated more ideas to maximize coverage, including pulling in military videographers, known as “combat cameras,” to offer “direct support of designated hotspots.” One official warned the idea came with too many risks, in part because they had been trained for battle, not protests. “It’s different than war photography in a few distinct ways,” the official said.The White House directive around the L.A. protests forced the agency to play more of an “attack-dog” role online to keep up with the administration’s demands, one former worker on the DHS media team told The Post.“That was the turning point to get even more aggressive with their messaging, and to paint pictures of these places as war-torn,” he said. “There was a much more blustery edge, and a need to put stuff out as quickly as you can. You’re steamrolling everything.”DHS knows we have very little staff right? I know it has been discussed but there has been no change to our staffing and they keep wanting more and more.When video producers weren’t available, public affairs officers were sent into the field to record ICE activities on their phones — a footage “force multiplier,” one DHS official said in an interview. Officers were traveling more to fill the White House’s almost insatiable demand for visuals, another official said.The push, however, left some of the officials fearful for their safety in the field. In July, DHS said, an ICE public affairs specialist was sent to the emergency room with a bloodied hand after being hit by a thrown rock outside a California marijuana farm.During an all-team meeting attended by public affairs officers, an official said he had been sent in a T-shirt to scenes where agents were wearing body armor, an ICE official recalled. (An ICE spokesman said the agency now ensures that public affairs officials have protective equipment, including body armor and first aid kits.)Still, public affairs officials have participated in the immigration operations. In September, Covington said in an internal chat message that she had been on a ride-along with federal agents when an immigrant from Venezuela was apprehended. “Target was a runner - I spotted him and we made the arrest,” she wrote.She uploaded photos of the man in handcuffs and asked in the chat whether he had been a known gang member, saying he “had some interesting tats.” An ICE legal associate told her their files showed no evidence of gang membership. Some of her colleagues congratulated her nonetheless. “Go [Public Affairs Office] Go!” one replied.The White House’s frenzy for more content, and DHS officials’ scramble to produce, led the team to push the boundaries in ways that disturbed some of its employees.ICE’s X account posted a video of a bound protester in Portland, Ore., being wheeled into custody face down on a flatbed cart, with the background lyrics, “they see me rollin’.” DHS’s account posted a clip of Illinois protesters and said, “Get a job you imbecilic morons.” It also shared a Halloween-styled montage of arrestees’ mug shots and warned there would be “no sanctuary for creatures & criminals of the night.”“They just went nuts,” a recently departed DHS producer told The Post. “It was no limit. … It was like if someone from Reddit took over.”Some prosecutors in U.S. attorneys’ offices complained to public affairs officials that the brash social media posts could jeopardize their cases by raising questions about bias or tainting the jury pool, one official said. (McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said she’d not heard this and said that if officials are so concerned about it, they should convey it to her, not journalists.)McLaughlin said that every organization has “conversations that you don’t think are going to get out to the public” but that she is not “going to lose sleep over” anything in the messages.ICE’s shifting attitude toward public messaging was especially noticeable in its use of music without the artists’ or labels’ permission, current and former DHS officials said, which past administrations had been far more cautious about. Some officials said in the chat that they were indifferent to the potential perils. When one employee raised concerns about copyright violations, another wrote back, dismissing them.At least five DHS and ICE videos have been taken down from X in recent months following complaints from representatives of the comedian Theo Von, the band MGMT, and rappers Jay-Z, Joey Valence, and Chamillionaire. Other companies and creators have complained that their intellectual property was used without permission, including the Pokémon Co., whose cartoon style was mimicked for a DHS video captioned “Gotta Catch ’Em All.”Trump administration officials have defended the intensity of their media operation to reporters by saying it’s what Americans want: visual proof that Trump is fulfilling his promise to deport millions of immigrants nationwide.Despite this, the media operations at DHS show no signs of slowing down. Inside the ICE team, the chats showed, many were proud of their work — and committed for the long haul.Reporting by Joyce Sohyun Lee and Drew Harwell. Jeremy B. Merrill contributed to this report.

Already in January this cluster will be launched,\" Interior and Administration Minister Marcin Kierwiński said during a press briefing in Ozierany.Kierwiński and Prime Minister Donald Tusk also visited the Border Guard post in Bobrowniki on Tuesday as part of the latest phase of strengthening security along the Polish-Belarusian border.However, activists who continue to provide humanitarian aid on the Polish-Belarusian border and human rights organisations say that although there are now fewer calls from migrants for help, the humanitarian situation remains difficult.While reinforcements of the Polish-Belarusian border continue, activists providing humanitarian assistance to migrants report both requests for support and finding bodies in the forest.Aid groups continue to receive calls for help, an activist working in Podlasie who spoke on condition of anonymity told Euronews.\"(Belarusian President Aliaksandr) Lukashenka withdrew migrants from the zone as they had been making arrangements since the borders opened, but this is not a man you can make arrangements with,\" they said.\"The problem is that these people are near Minsk, near Grodno and so on and they are trying to go through the (border crossing) and they can't do that either because the Court doesn't give them an interim (application for temporary protection).\"Belarus' military activities are not made public, but there is increasing talk of its involvement in Russia's all-out war in Ukraine.Recently, the opposition organisation BELPOL revealed in a YouTube video that a weapons factory is being built near Minsk.A BELPOL representative noted that Belarus does not currently manufacture key explosives components, meaning the plant will need to use imported technology and raw materials, with Russia and China as Belarus' main partners in the venture.\"Given the scope and volume of production, the end customer will be the Russian Federation,\" opposition figure Uladzimir Zychar said in the report published on YouTube.The government has long drawn public attention to the problem of illegal border crossings and migration. At the same time, there are increasing claims that the real threats are more likely to come from Belarus' military actions, according to Poland-based Belarusian news outlet Belsat.",

He reportedly survived airstrikes targeting IS militants in Pakistan.Gören had been operating alongside Özgür Altun, codenamed \"Abu Yasir Al Turki\", who previously played an active role in transferring IS members from Turkey to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region and was earlier captured and arrested, sources said.The warning said the organisation may plan armed attacks, suicide attacks, car bombings, drone attacks or driving vehicles into crowded areas.Shopping malls and public markets were identified as high-risk areas, and personnel were asked to take the highest level of precautions.The warning was attributed to the organisation's efforts to \"gain morale and create fear\" after its ability to carry out attacks was weakened by operations in Turkey and abroad.An investigation by the Terrorism Crimes Investigation Bureau, using Financial Crimes Investigation Board reports and social media analyses, revealed the organisation's structure in Ankara.Suspects provided cash to IS members and their families in conflict zones in Syria through bank accounts with explanations such as \"call for unity, atonement, aid for captive sisters,\" investigators said.",

Epstein” and addressed to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar is “fake,” asserting that the handwriting did not appear to match that of Jeffrey Epstein.The department had said earlier Tuesday that it was assessing the validity of the letter – which appeared to make crude references to President Donald Trump – because other details called into question whether it had actually been written and sent by Epstein.“This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual,” the Justice Department said in a post on X hours after the letter was released among a tranche of other Epstein-related records.The statement debunking the letter from the Justice Department noted that it was postmarked not in New York, where was Epstein was imprisoned, but in Virginia, and the return address was for a jail different than the one holding Epstein. The envelope was processed three days after Epstein’s suicide.Authorities have not accused Trump of any wrongdoing or charged him with any crimes in connection with Epstein.“Dear L.N.,” the letters reads, “As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home. Good luck! We shared one thing … our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our President also shares our love of young, nubile girls.” The letter makes another lewd reference to Trump’s treatment of women.In a separate statement the department released earlier Tuesday, not aimed at any specific record in the most recent release, the Department said that some of the documents released “contain untrue and sensationalist claims” against the president.“To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”The letter was postmarked three days after Epstein died. Prison staff are authorized to read and inspect outgoing mail, which can cause delays.Based on prison documents released from a Freedom of Information Act request, CNN previously reported that while he was jailed, Epstein appeared to send a letter to Nassar — although the contents of the letter were not disclosed. It was discovered by prison officials investigating Epstein’s suicide weeks after his death. It is not known if Nassar and Epstein had a relationship.This story has been updated with additional information from the Justice Department about the veracity of the letter.",

It also builds a theme that is gaining momentum in Brussels: finding alternatives to bypass national vetoes, in particular when exercised by Hungary, which has made its right to veto the centrepiece of its Brussels policy when it comes to Ukraine - from its financing to Kyiv's candidacy to join the EU.“We see straightforward commitment from the part of EU leadership to try to circumvent potential vetoes coming from Hungary and Slovakia and put important decisions on the footing of qualified majority voting,\" Dániel Hegedűs, a regional director of the German Marshall Fund, told Euronews.Poland ranks second with seven vetoes, while Slovakia, which has also been frequently in the headlines across Europe for the controversial decisions of Prime Minister Robert Fico, has blocked two decisions, both of them this year.Hungary has vetoed a significant number of joint foreign policy statements, but it has also blocked proposals to lend concrete support to Ukraine and start formal EU accession talks with Kyiv.Mikuláš Dzurinda, the chair of the Martens Centre think tank and former prime minister of Slovakia, told Euronews that leaders like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron now support changes to the bloc's voting rules.But any such move would require a treaty change, which would itself probably be resisted by Hungary – and potentially other member states too. Yet since the systematic use of the veto power has posed a problem for the EU for years, Brussels is now looking for more creative solutions.An EU diplomat, who spoke to Euronews on condition of anonymity, said that the European Commission is now deliberately structuring its proposals in order to avoid requiring unanimous consent from member states.To do this, the bloc has opted for a veto-proof strategy: the roadmap itself is not legally binding, but the legislation on cutting oil and gas imports will be adopted by a qualified majority at the European Council. Hungary and Slovakia will thus be obliged to drop Russian gas against their will.Both countries have already signalled that they will sue the EU and ask for the measure to be annulled.\"This is not the first time the EU has reclassified measures that could not gain enough support to be designated as sanctions,\" international law expert Tamás Lattmann said.“This has been on the agenda for years: if measures can not be imposed on Russian raw material procurement with sanctions regimes lacking the consensus, they can be reclassified as foreign trade or something else, and it becomes an EU competence,\" Lattmann told the podcast Pirkadat.A source at the European Commission told Euronews that Europe could also bypass opposition from member states by adopting a model similar to the Coalition of the Willing, a group of like-minded countries willing to support Ukraine.Former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, a highly influential voice in the European debate, has spoken in favour of this model, calling it \"pragmatic federalism\" as the political conditions for a true, federal union do not exist in the EU at the moment.The EU has seen many examples of how like-minded countries can advance together through voluntary co-operation, among them the Schengen project and various initiatives in migration and finance. This method is politically the most acceptable option for the bloc's more reluctant countries, and the EU is already operating as a multi-speed organisation.The Coalition of the Willing model can also be applied to matters beyond Ukraine, extending to defence and finance. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, also spoke in favour of it in an interview with Euronews, referring to it as a useful format when unanimity cannot be reached despite good faith efforts.Earlier this year, European Council President António Costa proposed amending the enlargement rules to expedite the process, eliminating the unanimous decision required for each chapter.But the changes would have required a treaty change, and the Hungarian premier quickly dismissed the idea at the Copenhagen informal summit in October.Right now, the EU is accelerating technical work on negotiating chapters, aiming to have most of the work completed once political approval is granted.Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos told Euronews at the flagship EU summit that Ukraine is \"technically ready\" to open up the clusters and that the bloc should get creative in finding a solution for it. But as it stands, unless rules are changed or Orbán can be convinced, Kyiv's bid to move closer to the EU would be stuck in limbo.Yet some experts warn that bypassing opposing member states in numerous different areas could backfire on the EU.Still, bypassing unanimity may present other problems. And it is not clear that all member states would like to see the power of the veto eroded over time, since it is often seen as the last resort to protect national interests.All member states have at some point threatened to use their veto at the Council. It also serves as an equaliser between smaller and larger member states, as it ensures that members of any given size hold equal power around the negotiating table.\"A veto power is the last line of defence of vital interests,\" Lattmann said. \"Every case of circumvention has led to a set of new problems, often the inoperability or discrediting of the system itself.\"",

Others have already had to drop out of university and were left with the costs.\"I think it's because the university may not have had the right accreditation for its courses,\" said Shambarkar. In a similar case, a student had already lost in court.\"They said that the appropriate infrastructure was lacking. There are too few professors at the university.\" Shambarkar has also lodged an appeal. But he has little hope.Students could complete it remotely - in Shambarkar's case, from India. They were promised a degree programme in Germany.\"Most of the students have since left,\" Shambarkar told Euronews. \"Many have changed universities, at least those from wealthy families. Others have gone back home. They were helpless.\"The company supports people who dream of studying abroad. The first part of the degree programme is completed online from India; in Shambarkar's case, it was the first semester. The students then move to Germany to complete their degree there.He was supposed to have continued his studies in Berlin in September. Instead, he is stuck in India. His visa has not yet been granted.One of his friends is already studying in Germany. \"He says I'm lucky I didn't get my visa. Otherwise I would have been deported too,\" says Tanishq.In India, he at least has the support of his family. \"In Germany, students have nothing,\" says the Indian national.Tanishq would prefer to simply forget about the experience. He has already invested a lot of time - \"a year wasted,\" as Tanishq puts it.Simply ticking it off and forgetting everything - that's hardly an option for Shambarkar. \"I've invested a lot of time and money,\" he explains.Another university is also not an option, as Shambarkar fears that they would not recognise his achievements.He still hopes to graduate from IU after all, and needs about six months to do so. \"I only have a few modules left and the Master's thesis,\" said Shambarkar.In particular, the LEA's change of visa policy for students \"who have entered the country under different conditions\" is incomprehensible, the university said.Looking back, the degree programme was \"disappointing,\" said Shambarkar. \"I never felt like I was at a university. There were a few classrooms, a few courses. I chose the right degree programme for me, but not the right university.\"The Berlin campus on Frankfurter Allee is more office-like than a university. Here in the Plaza, which also houses a shopping centre, IU has rented several floors.Contacting the university is complicated, explains Shambarkar. He received little support from the IU. \"They are now paying lawyers so that students don't have to use their own money to lodge an appeal,\" he claimed.\"It's hard to face the situation - mentally and physically,\" he stated. \"I'm treated like a criminal.\"Another student's example, who wished to remain anonymous, shows just how burdensome this is. \"I feel like a failure. The situation has massively damaged my psyche. Sometimes I feel like my life is about to end,\" he told Euronews.Although he came to Germany legally on a student visa and is still studying, he is also on the brink of deportation.\"I no longer have an appetite and suffer from nightmares and insomnia. My life feels like hell.\" The authorities have given him one month to leave the country.In the meantime, the IU no longer wants to accept international students at the Berlin campus, Euronews has learnt from insiders.A message obtained by Euronews states, \"Due to the ongoing legal and administrative uncertainties with the LEA, IU will suspend all new student admissions to the Berlin campus until further notice.\"A court has recognised that the IU has the necessary accreditation for degree programmes as well as sufficient staff and infrastructure.At the same time, the court has tightened the requirements, \"including stricter attendance controls with sanctions and examinations that take place exclusively on campus.\"The judges had made it clear that the judgment was highly controversial. It would contradict university law.A spokesperson for the Berlin State Office for Immigration told Euronews that residence permit extensions are regularly reviewed.The focus is on whether conditions such as \"sufficient livelihood, proper full-time studies, passport possession, no interest in deportation, for example due to the commission of criminal offences\" are met.Students would temporarily receive so-called \"fictitious certificates,\" meaning that the residence permit is \"granted or denied\". This also applies to IU students.",

    "details": "Just a year into her tenure as the top of the magazine's masthead, Dame Anna had already made a name for herself as an editor who instinctively understood the zeitgeist. She was the first to put a model in jeans on Vogue's front, and now, Madonna.For Marian Kwei, a stylist and Vogue contributor, this move speaks to Dame Anna's ability to make Vogue \"relevant to our times, make it contemporary, make it accessible\".\"Before, it was women who could buy couture who were interested in what Vogue had to say,\" she says. \"But Dame Anna realised the need to reach out to the kids listening to Madonna.\"While some have attributed her continued presence as a sign of unwillingness to cede total control, one could also see it as a recognition of her unmatched place in the fashion industry, and the fear that should she go entirely, this print magazine – already a relic to some – will lose its remaining clout.Once, fashion magazines like Vogue ruled the industry. They didn't have to fight for attention so much as just decree from on high what was and wasn't \"chic\".Whether you still see – or ever saw – Vogue as an arbiter of good taste, or reflection of our times, depends on who you talk to.For Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, the founder and editor-in-chief of academic fashion publication Vestoj, less so. When she was a teenager growing up in Sweden, \"Vogue represented the world out there, something glamorous and different and the wide horizons that I was striving for.\"Today, print magazines are fighting for survival in an increasingly crowded, fast-paced landscape – a monthly publication loses a lot of relevance in a by-the-minute digital world.All this will be factoring into Malle's thinking as she takes on the job of head of editorial content. She reportedly plans to put out issues less frequently, centred around themes or cultural events rather than months. She says she wants to lean into the idea of Vogue in print as something to collect and cherish.One of the ways that Dame Anna has kept Vogue a part of the conversation is by expanding the people she invited onto the cover.Since Maddona's debut, Dame Anna has placed royalty, politicians, pop stars, writers and gymnasts on the cover.Looking at the almost mythological position the Kardashians have gone on to occupy, the cover spoke to Dame Anna's uncanny ability to anticipate culture – as well, arguably, as drive it.But whether Dame Anna remains the right person to be at the helm, and whether the magazine can withstand increasing financial pressures, remains to be seen.Her decision to spotlight Lauren Sanchez, the now-wife of Jeff Bezos, also sparked accusations that the magazine was selling out. It was read by some as more about celebrating wealth and luxury than style. Interestingly, it was Malle who apparently organised the story on the power couple's wedding and was dispatched to write it.Vanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic of The New York Times pointed out in a recent article that \"while elite weddings are a hallmark of Vogue, they almost never made its cover, and Ms Sánchez Bezos seemingly had neither the celebrity nor modelling credentials that usually merited cover treatment.\" The couple's presence at Donald Trump's inauguration also drew criticism from some - and contributed to the cover's backlash, especially on social media.Dame Anna, who has supported Democratic candidates in the past, has over the years featured Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Jill Biden and, most recently, Kamala Harris. It feels pertinent that whether or not she will invite Melania Trump to be on the cover has been the subject of much discussion – and continues to be, even as Malle steps into the role.But Vogue can arguably withstand more of this kind of criticism than most because of its fabled history. As Lauren Sherman, the fashion journalist who broke the news of Malle's appointment, tells the BBC: \"The Vogue brand stands apart, and is one of the most important fashion brands in the world.\"A large part of Vogue's standing in the world is wrapped up in Dame Anna's own - the enigmatic editor-in-chief of fashion, with her instantly recognisable bob and her unknowability.\"Anna has been able to stay relevant despite all the various eras we've lived through simply by being as synonymous with culture, fashion and beauty as possible,\" says Kwei.This, despite being criticised for being late to make Vogue more diverse compared to other sections of the industry.\"She's a mainstream celebrity figure,\" says Odell. \"What other editor has had a book and an iconic movie made about them? You know, she's been played by Meryl Streep!\"While Malle may have inherited the magazine's prestige, \"it'll be up to Chloe and her team to see if they can use it wisely to influence the way the culture moves,\" says Sherman.Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

    "details": "Driving past the mountains, creeks, and rivers near her home in southwestern Germany, Kate Raidt says the scenery still catches her attention. She jokes that she’s “probably the only soccer mom from America who loves away games.”Raidt looks forward to the drive from Ulm, the city where she lives, to Munich for her teenage son’s soccer commitments. “It’s really hard to be in a bad mood when you’re driving through all of this beauty,” she says.“When you can look out and see the Swiss Alps or hear water running because of a creek or a river nearby, that is something that makes me so happy,” Raidt, originally from Atlanta, tells CNN Travel.A year and a half after relocating from the US to Germany with her son Bodie, Raidt says the move has gone “way better than anybody could have imagined,” and that both are thriving.Living close to natural sights like the Danube River and the Bavarian Alps has reshaped her daily routine. She’s constantly on the move — hiking, cycling along the Danube, visiting thermal spas or going “castle hunting” with her son.“That’s probably the biggest landslide win for being over here,” she says, praising a lifestyle she feels is focused less on quantity and more on quality.”My physical health. My mental health… Having such easy, quick physical activity at my fingertips completely saved me.”The decision to relocate began with her son’s opportunities. Bodie, a skilled soccer player, had been incited to try out for several German clubs and received offers.Although Raidt had visited Germany often — her daughter was born there during her marriage to a German native — she hadn’t planned to move back permanently. But her son’s ambitions changed her thinking.She told him they would wait until his older sister Conley left for college. “I didn’t want him living alone with a host family, so I decided to go with him,” she says.‘I cried copious tears’: She struggled and thought she’d never fit in after moving from Chicago to PolandThey started out in an Airbnb in Ulm, a historic city based between Munich and Stuttgart, where Bodie joined a local team. “I literally had two suitcases,” Raidt says. “We had no friends. No family. No nothing… So, it was just ready, set, go. Let’s make this happen.”Raidt says she soon realized she had a lot to learn. One of her first challenges was education. Bodie holds dual nationality but wasn’t able to enroll in a German high school as “he didn’t have enough foreign language experience.”He eventually joined an international school, which Raidt says was a turning point. She bonded quickly with other expat parents.“We’ve all left our home countries and come here,” she says. Their emotional support, Raidt adds, has helped her through difficult times.As Raidt settled in, she gained a deeper appreciation for life in Germany outside her remote work for a US-based company.She loves the fact that “people constantly get together for coffee,” in contrast to the US, where “everyone zips through the Starbucks drive-thru.”“America only has one city out of the whole entire place that really has a defined culture, and that’s New Orleans,” she says. “So, Germany kind of reminds me of that.”But there are downsides, she admits. She dislikes the amount of cigarette smoking and finds some aspects of daily life too rigid, too “black and white.”Bureaucracy has also been tricky to navigate due to the “constant stress of going to government offices and standing in line.”“Getting a driver’s license in Germany is like passing the bar exam or getting a medical license,” she says.‘The US is the best place to exist’: She returned to Germany after living in California, and now she’s full of regretShe says some people in Germany “simply hate immigrants,” and treat her differently because of her US accent.Still, she says the overall experience with Germans has been positive. She’s made “wonderful friends,” especially among parents on her son’s soccer team.“None of them really speak any English,” says Raidt. “But it’s forced me to improve my German and kind of meet in the middle.”Raidt had conversational German from her earlier visits, but she needed to improve her skills to cope with basic events like handling rental contracts, doctors’ appointments and official documents. She now takes a four-hour daily language course as she aims to pass the fluency exam she needs for citizenship.“There’s days where I’m like, ‘This is going to literally send me to my grave,’” she says. “But at the same time, it gets me out of bed.”For anyone considering a move abroad, Raidt advises choosing a place where where they speak the language already.“I learned very quickly that if you’re going to live somewhere your language better be better than conversational level,” she says. “Or it’s very hard.”Raidt finds Germany expensive, especially utilities and notes that “everything’s a little bit smaller” now including her car and her home. But that shift, she says, has clarified what she needsShe felt the difference sharply when she returned to the US for an extended stay in the spring. Sliding back into old habits — driving everywhere, sitting at a desk all day — left her “overwhelmed with emotions and stress.”“Even though I still had the same stress in my life, it didn’t nearly affect me as much once I got back here,” she says. “I think it’s because I was constantly physically moving and getting so much more exercise. It just kept me so sane.”Raidt has recently revived a former passion. She’s recording an album two decades after turning her back on music.Raidt doesn’t miss much about Atlanta, she says, but does yearn for her “mom friends” and had cravings for US fast food like Chick-fil-A.She returns to the US as often as she can to visit Conley, who plays college tennis in Nebraska. Meanwhile, Bodie seems to be thriving — a huge relief for Raidt.“Even if I loved it here, if he was miserable, we’d have to get out of here,” she says. “Because this is all for him. So the biggest win-win is that he’s been doing really well… And it was a big kind of lifestyle upgrade for me.”‘The best decision I ever made’: Why this New Yorker ditched the United States for ‘super safe’ GermanyThe pair currently live in a three-bedroom townhouse on the “mountain side” of Ulm, plan to stay in Germany for “at least two more years,” until Bodie graduates from high school.Raidt says that the sale of her home in Atlanta felt like the closing of the final chapter of her life in the US, and she doesn’t “have an interest in coming back.”“Maybe I go to Austria,” she says. “Maybe I go to Switzerland. Maybe I go to Spain… I don’t know. But I would love to keep exploring Europe. I would really love to stay over here.”",

    "details": "The US State Department on Tuesday imposed visa sanctions on a former top European Union official and employees of organizations that combat disinformation for alleged censorship – sharply ratcheting up the Trump administration’s fight against European regulations that have impacted digital platforms, far-right politicians and Trump allies, including Elon Musk.In a statement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the five sanctioned people of leading “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly condemned European nations for alleged censorship, and the latest State Department human rights report alleged “significant human rights issues” in allies like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany over “serious restrictions on freedom of expression.”The new sanctions were quickly met by outcry from European officials, including the French foreign minister.Among those sanctioned Tuesday are Thierry Breton, a former European commissioner involved in the Digital Services Act (DSA), a sweeping EU law that requires Big Tech platforms to take meaningful steps to reduce illegal and harmful content.In a social media post on Tuesday, Breton questioned: “Is McCarthy’s witch hunt back?”, referencing the late senator’s Cold-War era inquisition of alleged communists who he claimed had infiltrated American government institutions.The State Department also targeted the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Imran Ahmed. The organization says it “works to stop the spread of online hate and disinformation through innovative research, public campaigns and policy advocacy.”Clare Melford, the CEO of the Global Disinformation Index, was also sanctioned. The organization describes itself as working to strengthen “the systems that make the internet safer by working with governments, industry, and civil society.”In a statement to CNN a spokesperson for GDI said that the sanctions amounted to an “authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship.”“The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with,” the spokesperson said. “Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.”Leaders of the German organization HateAid, Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, were also sanctioned. The organization aims to combat “hate, violence and systematic disinformation” on the internet.“It is an act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary. This marks a new escalation: The US government is clearly questioning European sovereignty,” they said.“We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,” they continued. “Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever. We stand in solidarity with all those affected, and with all those who now fear similar measures.”Rubio’s statement said that for the five sanctioned people, he had “determined that their entry, presence, or activities in the United States have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”“These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies,” he said.The top US diplomat said that “based on these determinations,” the State Department “has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.” Further, the Department of Homeland Security “can initiate removal proceedings against certain individuals … which renders such individuals deportable,” he said.US Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers specifically referenced that letter in a post on X Tuesday, accusing Breton of having “ominously reminded Musk of X’s legal obligations and ongoing ‘formal proceedings’ for alleged noncompliance with ‘illegal content’ and ‘disinformation’ requirements under the DSA.”Rogers, in a social media post, accused Melford’s organization of using US “taxpayer money to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press.”“The State Department stands ready and willing to expand today’s list if other foreign actors do not reverse course,” Rubio said.In February Vice President JD Vance used one of his first major speeches after taking office to criticize what he described as censorship efforts in Europe in a speech delivered at the Munich Security Conference.“It looks more and more like old entrenched interest, hiding behind ugly, Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion,” he added.",

The State Hermitage Museum said all international standards were observed during the expeditions.Myrmekion is located near modern Kerch in Crimea. Notable finds during Butyagin's excavations include coins from various periods, including Alexander the Great's era, according to reports.The Ukrainian Centre for Journalist Investigations reported that Butyagin was involved in organising expeditions in Kerch during Russia's occupation.",

    "details": "South Africans have long suspected corruption and political interference were at work in the police force but in the past few months allegations appearing to confirm this have been aired in two public inquiries.President Cyril Ramaphosa is currently digesting the contents of an interim report from a commission he established to investigate illegality within the police.It was set up after senior police officer Lt-Gen Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged in July that organised crime groups had infiltrated the government.Lt-Gen Mkhwanazi, who heads up the police in KwaZulu-Natal province, claimed that Mchunu had ties to crime kingpins and this was why he shut down an elite unit investigating political murders.Mchunu, a senior member of Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC) and a close ally of the president, has denied any wrongdoing.But to investigate the allegations, Ramaphosa asked retired Constitutional Court judge Mbuyiseli Madlanga to head up a public inquiry. Parliament in Cape Town set up its own panel to investigate the matter.\"As I see it now, this is terrorism,\" Gen Mkhwanazi said appearing as the Madlanga Commission's first witness in September.These are \"people who want to take over government, not through the ballot paper but through these criminal activities\".In the three months of testimony from the parallel inquiries, South Africans have heard about an alleged drug cartel with political connections and a businessman, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, with alleged ties to leading government figures. A witness at the Madlanga Commission was also murdered after giving evidence.Among the most explosive evidence was the testimony given by police crime intelligence boss Lt-Gen Dumisani Khumalo.Appearing before the Madlanga Commission within the first month of hearings, Lt-Gen Khumalo alleged there was a drug trafficking cartel, headed by individuals who he called the Big Five, operating in several provinces, which had \"penetrated the political sphere\".He named two figures from the five alleged leaders of this criminal gang, one of them being controversial businessman Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala.The crime intelligence boss claimed the Big Five led a network with widespread influence across the country.He alleged that it was a cartel, that was operating both locally and abroad, and dealt mainly with narcotics but also carried out contract killings \"associated with the drug trafficking processes\", cross-border hijackings and kidnappings.This cartel had tentacles within the country's criminal justice system, and this allowed them to \"manipulate investigations, suppress evidence [and] obstruct legal proceedings that threaten their activities\", Lt-Gen Khumalo added.It was this grouping that was allegedly behind the disbandment of the political killings task team (PKTT), which was working mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.This is because the cartel \"mistakenly thought the PKTT was investigating\" them, Lt-Gen Khumalo told the commission.\"The Big Five has already penetrated the political sphere and there are documented cases of high-profile connections in the political arena,\" the policeman alleged.Another witness at the Madlanga Commission had been part of the PKTT. Anonymised – and known only as \"witness C\" - he also mentioned what he called the Big Five cartel, alleging it had \"full control and oversight\" in every government department.Central to the allegations against the suspended police minister is his alleged close relationship with \"Cat\" Matlala.At the Madlanga Commission, Mkhwanazi repeated claims he had made at a press conference in July that Mchunu was indirectly receiving financial support from the businessman to fund his \"political endeavours\".He shared copies of text messages and a payment allegedly made by Matlala to prove this at the time. These payments were seemingly facilitated by a third party.During his appearance at the Madlanga Commission Mchunu refuted the allegations saying that he had \"never been accused of corruption, not once\".Mr Matlala had a lucrative contract with the police before it was abruptly cancelled when he was charged for attempted murder in May.Over the years, he would be arrested for a string of alleged crimes, including house robberies, a cash-in-transit heist and assault, but in all cases he denied involvement and was either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn against him.As he is now in custody over the attempted murder charge, he gave evidence with restraints around his ankles. Over the course of his two-day testimony in front of MPs Mr Matlala laid bare his description of relationships with former and current ministers as well as top police officials.Apart from being accused of having close ties to Mchunu, Mr Matlala has been linked to others in the police force.He denied knowing the senior police officers and politicians personally but admitted making payments for ANC-related activities.\"From what I understand, the minister [Mchunu] sent [a third party] to go ask for donations there and there, and I was one of them,\" Mr Matlala told MPs.Cele, who testified before Mr Matlala's appearance at the parliamentary committee, admitted to MPs that he had known Mr Matlala for a couple of months and had stayed at his penthouse on two occasions as these were \"freebies\".Mr Matlala has not yet appeared at the Madlanga Commission but is expected to have a chance to speak there at some point next year.Various witnesses, however, painted a different picture of Mr Matlala's relationship with the police.Witness C told the Madlanga Commission that Mr Matlala had \"close relationships with senior [police] officials\" and had detailed the extent of this after police arrested him back in May.The witness alleged that Mr Matlala contributed money towards the now-suspended police minister's presidential ambitions within the ANC even though he did not believe he would win.A witness at the Madlanga Commission was murdered in early December, just three weeks after he gave testimony.Marius van der Merwe, who was identified only as \"Witness D\" during his appearance, was killed in full view of his family.He had just returned home in the evening and was gunned down as he waited for the front gate to open. No arrests have been made but three people of interest have been identified by police. The motive for the shooting is unclear.The identity of Mr Van der Merwe, a former police officer who ran a private security company, was confirmed by authorities after his murder.In his appearance in front of Judge Madlanga he had implicated officials, including Brig Julius Mkhwanazi (no relation to Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi) who was acting police chief for an area including parts of Johannesburg.There he had claimed Brig Mkhwanazi ordered him to get rid of the body of a man accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officials.Commenting on this, Mr Van der Merwe told the commission: \"I really did not have a chance to agree. I felt like I was being forced.\"In his testimony, Brig Mkhwanazi denied having any involvement in the case including the alleged disposal of the body. Instead, he told the commission he had been called to the scene of a crime within the municipality and had stayed there for \"two to three minutes\".The targeting of whistleblowers has become common in the country, with rights groups like Human Rights Watch noting that \"many face retaliation, loss of livelihood and even loss of life\".The authorities revealed that Mr Van der Merwe had refused witness protection following his testimony at the commission.Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said that Judge Madlanga's interim report would not be made public as it was not \"helpful to start... debating on something that is half-baked\".\"The commissioner will [however] advise the president on areas that are of national security sensitivity and how those areas will need to be managed,\" he added in a briefing to journalists.The Madlanga Commission is carrying out its work in three phases; the first phase gave witnesses a chance to present their allegations.The second phase, currently under way, allows those implicated by evidence given to the inquiry, like Mchunu, to respond to the allegations made against them.The final phase will recall witnesses mentioned in the first phase to clarify or make additions to their statements.South Africans will now have to wait until some point next year to read the findings and recommendations from both inquiries. The question they are asking is whether these will be enough to force the government to deal with the problems critics say exist in the police service.Jane Ansah is going in a private capacity but reports about the cost and entourage have riled people up.",

No arrests were made as of Tuesday morning, police said.Police arrived to find two men dead from severe beating and a third victim critically injured, Guardia Civil sources said. All three victims are German nationals.Victims suffered fatal injuries inside a large residence, where they were beaten with sticks and blunt objects in an \"extremely violent\" attack, according to police. Bodies were dragged outside the property before the neighbour spotted them.Local police from Elche, Guardamar del Segura, Santa Pola and San Fulgencio initially responded to the report of a fight and then requested Guardia Civil backup after determining the incident's severity.A Specialist Guardia Civil unit deployed for high-risk operations has maintained the security perimeter around the property, according to reports. Authorities said there was no indication that the suspects were armed, and no hostages were involved.Guardia Civil ruled out professional hit or contract killing based on the nature of the attack. Investigation remains open to determine motive.",

    "details": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected President Donald Trump’s request to allow him to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to protect ICE agents, a significant and rare loss for the administration on the conservative court’s emergency docket.“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the court said in its unsigned order.The decision, which came over dissents from conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, was a substantial setback and appeared almost certain to jeopardize deployments of the National Guard in other cities as well.In a statement Tuesday, a White House spokeswoman said the ruling will not stop Trump’s efforts to enforce immigration laws, protect federal personnel and “safeguard the American public.”“He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNN. “Nothing in today’s ruling detracts from that core agenda.”Vladeck described the decision as “by far the most significant defeat the Supreme Court has handed Trump all year.”Federal law allows a president to federalize the National Guard when he can no longer execute the laws of the United States with “regular forces.” A debate cropped up during the case about whether that term, “regular forces,” meant the regular military or federal agents, such as those who work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.In its order, the court said that the term “likely” refers to the standing military. Further, the court said the ability to federalize the guard under the law Trump attempted to invoke “likely applies only where the military could legally execute the laws.” In other words, the court suggested, it does not apply to protecting agents enforcing immigration laws.“Thus, at least in this posture, the government has not carried its burden to show that” the law at issue in the case, “permits the president to federalize the guard in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois,” the court said.The decision leaves Trump with few options if he wants to continue to deploy soldiers into cities — but not zero options. It appears likely that the president could still invoke the Insurrection Act, for instance, to deploy regular forces to Chicago and other cities. That may be a politically fraught move, however, because it challenges the longstanding prohibition on the military being used for law enforcement.Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who sided with the court’s underlying decision, said he would have done so on more narrow grounds. He agreed that the term regular forces means the US military.“The court’s legal interpretation, as I understand it, could lead to potentially significant implications for future crises that we cannot now foresee,” Kavanaugh said.But he said the court’s decision appeared to bind the court’s hands in potentially unforeseen ways. What if, Kavanaugh hypothesized, an angry crowd gathered outside a federal court house threatening to storm the building. If regular military forces could not deploy in time, the decision appears to bar the president from federalizing the National Guard to deal with that situation, Kavanaugh said.Alito, joined by Thomas, wrote that he “strongly” disagreed with the way the court dealt with the case.“The court fails to explain why the president’s inherent constitutional authority to protect federal officers and property is not sufficient to justify the use of National Guard members in the relevant area for precisely that purpose,” Alito wrote. “I am not prepared at this point to express a definite view on these questions, but I have serious doubts about the correctness of the court’s views.”Alito argued that his colleagues had “no basis for rejecting the president’s determination that he was unable to execute the federal immigration laws using the civilian law enforcement resources at his command.”“Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted,” Alito wrote.The court’s decision, which landed two months after the Trump administration filed its emergency appeal, came as tensions on the ground at an ICE facility west of Chicago appeared to have eased. The administration told a federal court in a different case weeks ago that “increased coordination” with local police had “reduced the need for federal officers” to engage with protesters at the building in suburban Broadview.The court took an unusually long time to resolve the emergency dispute, which the Trump administration first brought to the court in mid-October. Given the unusual amount of back and forth between the justices in Tuesday’s order, it appears likely the court’s conservative majority wrestled with how to resolve the case.Though the situation on the ground in Chicago quieted, the administration argued in court papers in November that the deployments were still needed.While the case has been pending, the Justice Department told the Supreme Court, “violent assailants have fired shots at DHS agents, thrown bricks and concrete at barricaded agents, and rammed into their vehicles with trucks.”In that sense, the emergency appeal remained a major test of the president’s power to mobilize and deploy the guard in American cities.The court’s decision came weeks after a shooting in Washington, DC, in late November that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another. The shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who previously worked with the US in Afghanistan. Lakanwal has been charged with several crimes including premeditated murder and assault with intent to kill.Trump is using the National Guard in Washington under a different federal law that was not at issue before the Supreme Court.Trump had argued that a lower court decision blocking that deployment in Chicago “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property,” effectively inserting the courts into the chain of command.The Supreme Court was asked to take up the issue as the administration was attempting to deploy guard members to multiple cities, including Portland, Memphis and Los Angeles.When the feds come to town: In cities targeted by Trump’s immigration crackdown, a shared playbook emergesUS District Judge April Perry, nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, said the administration overstepped its authority with the deployment given the conditions on the ground. In a lengthy opinion tied to her short-term order, she questioned the administration’s justification for the troops.Though the case was initially speeding through the courts, the justices slowed things down considerably in late October by ordering additional briefing on a technical but important question about what the law means when it allows a president to use the guard to augment “regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”Illinois argued that language meant Trump could call in the guard to help the standing military, not civilian law enforcement agencies like ICE. The Department of Justice countered that reading would be counterintuitive since the standing military is generally barred from executing federal law. The state and the administration spent weeks filing briefs and counter briefs addressing that question.The states challenging the administration have balked at the suggestion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army.",

The details have been disputed by her office.In power since October, the vice-president's government has pledged to manage the economy competently and has already announced a raft of austerity measures.Malawian media have published further alleged details about the visit, reportedly from leaked documents saying it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.While the vice-president's office has confirmed the trip, it has disputed the information in circulation about how much the state is spending.\"These documents did not originate from any government institution and do not reflect official records or approved government expenditures,\" the vice-president's press secretary Richard Mveriwa said in a statement.\"The Office of the Vice President remains committed to transparency, accountability, and the responsible use of public resources, and strongly condemns the deliberate spread of false information intended to mislead the public.\"The spokesperson did not, however, say anything about the number of people making the trip, said to include two accountants, four security personnel, three assistants to the vice-president, and other officials.A Malawian human rights organisation, the Human Rights Defenders Coalition (HRDC) said it finds the reported size of the delegation \"deeply troubling, particularly given that the trip is explicitly described as private yet appears to be financed using public resources\".Ansah was the running mate to President Peter Mutharika, who soundly beat incumbent Lazarus Chakwera in September's election.They promised a \"return to proven leadership\" that would manage the economy better than the Chakwera administration.Among the announced cutbacks in government spending are a reduction of both domestic and international travel by senior government officials.When he was sworn in, Mutharika promised to be prudent. He said his government would not be a \"feast\" for members of the administration and supporters.\"While Malawians are continuously urged to tighten their belts, endure hardship and accept reduced public services in the name of fiscal discipline, senior political leaders appear to exempt themselves from these very principles,\" the organisation said.",

Rescuers then found the body of a one-year-old, who they believe was one of her children. Efforts to find a second child are continuing.The boat was making its way last Thursday from the riverside town of Huay Xay to the historic city of Luang Prabang in northern Laos, a common route along the Mekong - and popular with visitors to the country.\"The [crew] were just totally unprepared for that. There was a lot of confusion... it happened really, really fast,\" Anthonin said.As the boat continued to capsize, passengers shouted to a passing boat for help, but it did not stop - possibly because, according to him, it was relatively small.The second one, however, did stop and take them in. However, according to British tourist Bradley Cook, another passenger on board, that briefly \"made it worse\".Some people managed to climb over to the ferry, while others swam for it, hung onto the rails and got pulled up by others. Both Anthonin and Mr Cook were among those rescued.Anthonin says he was helping some other passengers retrieve their luggage at the back of the sinking ferry when he saw a Lao mother and her two children.\"Some people were crying, panicking. It was a mess,\" he said. \"[But] I didn't fear for my life... I was more affected by the three missing people.\"Lao media later reported that the body of the Lao woman Pany Her and a one-year-old child were found, separately, near Luang Prabang.\"We were just joking around,\" Mr Baranovičius said, adding that his attitude quickly changed when he realised they were sinking.After getting on the rescue boat, Mr Baranovičius said he starting filming what was happening on board \"but then I heard other people screaming so [I] turned off the camera and went straight to help other people in the water get on the boat.\"For Mr Cook, the experience was \"terrifying\" and it made him want to get out of Luang Prabang, \"although everyone's really friendly here\", because it was a constant reminder of his narrow escape.Speaking to the BBC from Vang Vieng, a town in northern Laos, Mr Cook said he planned to file for insurance claims for his electrical items that were broken and for cash that was lost, though he was not sure who would be held responsible.\"I'm assuming it's just a freak accident,\" he said, though he added he \"was not sure how avoidable\" the ferry capsizing was.The boat reportedly became entangled in a fishing net, causing loss of control and the vessel overturning in strong currents.A new definition of what constitutes as the Aravalli hills could dilute environmental protections, say activists.The Bondi shooting, and a deadly stabbing attack just last year, have left scores scarred and traumatised.",

The team deserved to win comfortably today but this is football. This is why football is so great and everyone loves it. So to penalties, but a win is a win and we are in the semi-finals.\"This is the highest level and if you don't take your chances, they will take one. So we have to learn from mistakes. We all want to score. At the end of the game we cannot give away the throw ins, the free kicks. We have to be more composed.\"On Kepa's penalty save: \"So pleased for him. He deserves it. He's a very good guy, a hard worker and giving his best every training session. So happy for him. Many penalties and the decisive one he saves it. It shows everyone in this team has their time and he saved us.\"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta speaking to Sky Sports: \"Very happy to be in the semi-final. We played against\na team that is very difficult to generate chances against. We generated a lot\nand should have scored many more goals than the one we scored. When you\ndon’t close the games, it [conceding] can always happen. A set-piece, a long throw or a\nwide free-kick, it can happen.\"I think the players were so composed with the\npenalties and in the end, Kepa managed to save one. We are where we want to be.\"Asked about Gabriel Martinelli's injury: \"He could not carry on so we had to make the sub. But we were really good, we generated a lot of chances.\"In the second\nhalf, they were more aggressive and we generated chances but we didn’t find the\ntrigger in the right moment to put the ball in the back of the net. But\noverall, another victory and I’m really happy.\"Happy with the performance after making eight changes? \"It is always tough. They don’t always have the right\nchemistry, there’s a lot of changes and some of them haven’t played together, but\ntheir attitude is excellent.How important is it to be within touching distance of silverware? \"It’s the second season in a row we are in the semi-final of\nthis competition, so, yeah, a game every three days. We have the Christmas\nperiod right now. I wish everyone a happy Christmas and all the best for the\nNew Year, and we will be here again in a few days.\"Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner speaking to ITV: \"It is always the case that in penalty shootouts one kick is the difference. Today we missed it but there is nobody to blame. In the first half we had a bad performance but then coming back like we did in the second half was much better.\"Then when we conceded the goal it was deja vu from the league game. Then coming back again is a huge credit to the players and then in a penalty shootout anything is possible. We already won two this year but today Arsenal were the lucky ones. They took them so well.\"I've seen many penalty shootouts but I can't remember one where every single one was taken so well. Then OK one has to miss otherwise we will shoot until tomorrow. Unfortunately we were the ones [to miss] today but we can build on the second half performance.I have been there as a Chelsea player to the Emirates and it is hostile. Very rarely is the Emirates hostile, but it is for that game.Kepa Arrizabalaga was the hero as he saved the decisive penalty from Maxence Lacroix to help Arsenal beat Crystal Palace and progress to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup in a game packed with late drama.However, Palace got a dramatic leveller in the fifth minute of stoppage time when Adam Wharton floated in a free-kick and Marc Guehi was the quickest to react to Jefferson Lerma's knockdown to score from close range.Declan Rice then had a chance to win the match for Arsenal with the last kick of the game, but he could not score past the excellent Walter Benitez.The stand-in Palace goalkeeper had been their best player throughout the match, making two excellent saves from Gabriel Jesus to keep the scores level until the latter stages.When I look at the chances from open play, I thought they were pretty good in creating the opportunities. I just feel as though they came up against a really inspired keeper tonight that was at the top of his game.You have to go back to Tottenham in terms of when Arsenal last played a really fluid, 'on it' game. So there is a little question mark there for me.They will look back on tonight and will be thinking, 'We could have scored a hatful' - well perhaps they should have scored a hatful.Arsenal still haven’t hit their sweet spot this season, but they’re top of the league, top of the Champions League, and into the semi-finals of the League Cup. Got to be grateful for where we are right now, and the performances will come as the season goes on. COYG!Everyone that stepped up to that spot this evening [for Arsenal] had an assuredness about them, a real confidence about them. Seasoned professionals, international players.You felt much more confident when the Arsenal players were stepping up rather than the Crystal Palace players.\"We conceded in a couple of games in the last minute and so that is something we have to improve and focus on.\"On keeping belief during shootouts: \"You have to keep cold and think of the next one. Don't lose your focus because as soon as you save one, maybe it's decisive.\"Arsenal defender William Saliba speaking to Sky Sports: \"We are so happy to be in the semi-final. You have to learn the lessons from last season because we got to the semi-final and lost the two games. [This time] we want to win both games and go to the final.\"Lacroix gave Arsenal the lead and then sent them through by missing his penalty. Familiar story. Although on balance they were worth the win, Arsenal have let opposition players do the job for them far too much recently. They need to get the end result for themselves.You very rarely get to practice penalties for real. All of those players that managed to take the penalties have now had the practice to walk up to the spot, they know how it feels, and what it feels like to score.It only took Kepa one time to go the right way and it was the defining moment. The save that puts Crystal Palace out and Arsenal through to the semi-finals. Right now the Emirates is absolutely rocking.Crystal Palace will be left licking their wounds. They have given everything here tonight, but they have just come up short.Calling it now, Arsenal are winning nothing this season. Such a blunt attack and can’t rely on own goals to silverware.Kepa Arrizabalaga was the hero as he saved the decisive penalty from Maxence Lacroix to help Arsenal beat Crystal Palace in a shootout and progress to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup in a game packed with late drama.However, Palace got a dramatic leveller in the fifth minute of stoppage time when Adam Wharton floated in a free-kick and Marc Guehi was the quickest to react to Jefferson Lerma's knockdown to score from close range.Declan Rice then had a chance to win the match for Arsenal with the last kick of the game, but he could not score past the excellent Walter Benitez.The stand-in Palace goalkeeper had been their best player throughout the match, making two excellent saves from Gabriel Jesus to keep the scores level until the latter stages.The Gunners move into the last four of the competition and will face London rivals Chelsea over two legs for a place in the final.Mikel Arteta will be pleased that his side managed to get through penalties to reach the semi-finals but the way that his players managed the tie will have disappointed the Arsenal manager.The Gunners were again far from their best and missed a host of chances before Lacroix's late own goal.Even by his own standards Arteta was exceptionally emotional in his technical area, and only became more lively as the game ticked into the final couple of minutes.William Saliba gave away a needless free-kick in stoppage time which led to the Palace equaliser but fortunately for him, his team-mates ensured that his mistake did not lead to them exiting the competition.Arsenal had a small wobble recently, with draws against Sunderland and Chelsea and a loss to Aston Villa, and even though they have started a new run of victories, Arsenal are not near to the levels of performance they set at the beginning of the season.With the FA Cup and Community Shield in the trophy cabinet and a first European campaign under way, things are pretty good in south London.However, there is the feeling that things could be even better if their top-class manager Oliver Glasner had more options in his squad.The Palace boss made three changes to the side thrashed at Leeds but the Eagles have started to falter and look tired in recent weeks, as their increased fixture schedule starts to catch-up with their relatively small squad.However, in the main, Glasner has made them exceptionally resolute and it was that belief that helped them equalise late on.Palace are without injured key player Daniel Munoz, lost Chris Richards to what looked like a serious injury during the game and have striker Jean-Philippe Mateta carrying an injury, but Glasner is still managing to keep his side competitive in multiple competitions.The Eagles almost forced their way through to the last four but, although disappointed, they should be pleased with the fight they showed against a top team.After the opportunity to rate players has closed, the score displayed represents the average from all the submissions by BBC Sport users.",

It is not doing, he is very committed to the team and I hope we can keep him here.\"[A] situation we cannot control, but Antoine right now is our player, going to continue playing for us. If you ask me, I don't want to lose him, definitely don't. But every time the market opens, you never know what is going to happen.\"With that in mind, it is understood Semenyo will prioritise a club he believes can provide him with what he views as the most suitable project to compete for major trophies on a long-term basis.The location and impact on his family will also be a contributing factor to his decision and it is understood he does not want the saga to become a long drawn-out process.Manchester City spent vast sums last January because of an injury crisis and look set to add big-money signing Semenyo this time around in very different circumstances.City are chasing Arsenal in the Premier League title race, one of four fronts both teams are competing in, and boss Pep Guardiola has decided to strengthen the right-hand side of his attack.The Ghanaian offers pace and direct running from that flank and it will be of great satisfaction to Guardiola that he chose City over the other options he had.But one in means one may now leave, with Savinho or Oscar Bobb possibly being moved on to accommodate him.Tottenham held talks over Brazil's Savinho in the summer but were not able to agree a fee, so could they test the waters again when the transfer window opens next month?Slot frustrated as Liverpool set to lose Isak for 'long time' VideoSlot frustrated as Liverpool set to lose Isak for 'long time'Stunning Rogers double secures Villa win over Man Utd.

Families from the Philippines, which was colonized by Spain for hundreds of years, celebrate with favorites like pancit or fruit salad.This year, increased immigration enforcement across the country has cast a shadow on the holiday for many Latino families.For years, the Cortes family’s Nochebuena spilled out of their small Southern California apartment — a night thick with the scent of masa, meat and simmering broth. Patriarch Francisco swayed to songs by Los Pasteles Verdes and the sound of cumbia while helping in the kitchen.By nightfall, the table was overflowing with food. The tree glowed.

And for a few hours each Christmas Eve, everything in their world — the two parents who came from Guerrero, Mexico, nearly four decades ago, the six children they raised here, the grandchildren underfoot — fit inside that bright, crowded room.This year, however, Nochebuena will be quieter and dimmer. The speaker that once played Los Pasteles Verdes hasn’t been touched. The kitchen won’t filled with tamales waiting to be steamed.

He didn’t even know what had happened. I took it as a sign.”So the family kept believing.

    "details": "So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple: If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"The Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit.Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson.Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.The US president has long denied any wrongdoing in relation to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

But in her defence she had just finished the series, walked out of her home and there I was.\"But everyone has been so lovely, there's also an incredible statistic about the difference the show has made to charities, especially ones for male survivors of sexual assault.The show says it was based on real-life events experienced by the show's creator, Richard Gadd, who also plays the lead character.Netflix failed in its attempt to persuade the judge to throw out the legal case brought against it, but said: \"We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story.\"\"We always checked in with each other and the producers and director made sure everything felt safe and considered.\"Baby Reindeer started life as a stage show at the Fringe at Edinburgh, Gunning had tried to see but couldn't get tickets so bought the play text instead.Her persistence paid off, and Gunning swept up during award season, winning an Emmy, a Bafta, a Golden Globe, an RTS and a Screen Actors Guild award.\"It's all been a bit pinch me, for all of the cast and crew really, we were out in LA, which is just crazy anyway to be in Hollywood. All the clichés are true, even to be nominated is an honour.\"Sometimes I look at the shelf that has my awards on and I think 'Oh my gosh', it feels like a dream really.\"Gunning has been in the industry for almost two decades, but Baby Reindeer has been a life-changing experience.\"I feel like on the one hand my life has completely changed, but I also feel exactly the same in a good way.\"\"I feel like if something like Baby Reindeer happened straight after coming out of drama school, maybe I'd feel like a bit of a deer in the headlights, pardon the pun.\"Now I feel a lot more grounded and I've got a big group of family and friends. But it is kind of strange, the number of viewers that Netflix bring in, you can't really compute. If you think about it too much it can feel a little bit scary.\"Gunning will next be on-screen on Christmas Eve, in the BBC One and Children In Need animation Pudsey and the Thread of Hope.It is based on an original story by McFly star and composer for the Paddington muscial Tom Fletcher, who's also written the music for the cartoon.Gunning plays a woman grieving for her husband, while her son is also navigating his way through grief.It is a handbrake turn after Baby Reindeer, but Gunning says the script was \"beautiful\" and she wanted to be involved \"in the special charity\".\"Children can deal with big issues like this, and hopefully children will watch and feel seen if they've experienced this, or are going through something similar.\"\"All my life I've grown up with Children In Need, I went to school dressed up as an Emu and wore it all day.\"She's starring alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield in a film adaptation of Enid Blyton's much-loved children's book, The Magic Faraway Tree, and is filming a comedy with Angelina Jolie.The actress who's from the West Yorkshire market town where enduring BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed jokes: \"It's Holmfirth to Hollywood.\"",

A final battle is about to commence.Hawkins was under seige, with Rifts - or dimensional tears - opening up, letting in terrifying Demogorgons from the Upside Down, while the town was under military quarantine.The hunt for Eleven, played by Millie Bobby Brown, intensified. She and Hopper (David Harbour), were battling evil forces in a military base in the Upside Down. They stumbled on a hideous flesh wall, and encountered fearsome government scientist Dr Kay, played by Terminator star Linda Hamilton.The huge revelation was Will discovering he has supernatural powers... plus something unusual was afoot in a cave with Max, Holly and Vecna, in his earlier, creepy incarnation of Henry Creel.There are still plenty of loose threads to tie up, and fans will be hoping the finale won't disappoint them, after endings for series like Game of Thrones and Lost proved divisive and disappointing for some.Stranger Things' executive producer Shawn Levy said the show's last, feature-length episode has been carefully crafted for its huge global fanbase.\"They have had their hearts broken by shows they loved, that failed fans in the end,\" he recently told Variety, adding that series creators, the Duffer brothers, \"did not want, and do not want, and refuse to be one of those shows\".We all want to know why Henry Kreel, played by Jamie Campbell Bower, looks scared outside the cave where Max Mayfield and Holly Wheeler take refuge.They appear to be trapped inside one of Henry's early memories, with Holly in his childhood home and Max in the cave.Fans on Reddit and TikTok have a few ideas... but they're related to the stage play Stranger Things: The First Shadow, which we won't spoil here.We already know Henry killed his mother and sister, leaving his wounded father to take the blame. Henry, of course, ended up in the Hawkins Lab, where he met Eleven, who expelled him with her powers, transforming him into Vecna.Meanwhile Holly (played by Nell Fisher), the sister of Mike and Nancy, was kidnapped by a Demogorgon from her home, where her mum tried to defend her in a bloody battle.The other kids and Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) are all doing their best to save their friends and the citizens of Hawkins.Joyce Montepiedra speculated in GameRant it's because \"music helps redirect the victim's attention back to reality and away from Vecna's mind games\".When Max looked like her end was nigh, hearing Running Up That Hill by Kate Bush tethered her to reality, keeping her alive.Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke) realised, after visiting Victor in an asylum, that music can penetrate a person's consciousness  - and break them out of Vecna's control.Montepiedra also notes the significance of Hawkins' radio station, which features a show hosted by Robin and Steve Harrington, played by Joe Keery.\"And if the main characters who gain control of the radio station are the ones who know the link between music and Vecna's curse, then they can provide the citizens of Hawkins with constant protection in the guise of entertainment.\"The show still needs to dig more into this storyline, and Noah Schnapp recently told Deadline this would be explored.\"It almost felt very Harry Potter to me that I had to go back and re-watch the movies, because the Harry Potter-Voldemort relationship felt very close to Will and Vecna, just kind of exploring those parallels and what that means.\"\"I think it does a great job closing everyone's individual story and doing a service to all of them.\"Once the show is over, it would be tempting for the Duffer brothers to consider making a money-spinning sequel at some point.\"This really is the end of the story of Eleven and Mike and Lucas and Dustin and Steve and all these characters, and Hawkins specifically,\" GamesRadar quoted Ross Duffer saying.\"The book is closed, and the ending wouldn't be very impactful if we left it cracked open for some sort of sequel.\"The Scottish singer has been gifted a jacket by the US actor after he hailed her one of his biggest British heroes.",

    "details": "One of China’s most popular short-video and streaming platforms was flooded with porn and violent content earlier this week, sparking outrage and bafflement in a nation where the internet is tightly controlled.“What happened to Kauishou? The moment I scroll into a livestream, it’s nothing but porn,” one user said on popular Chinese social media Weibo.In a Tuesday statement, the Beijing-based company blamed the attacks on “underground and gray industries,” which in China refers to ecosystems of illegal or quasi-legal operations that exploit the internet for illicit profit.Kuaishou said it had reported the incident to the police and that its app has gradually resumed normal operations.China maintains one of the world’s most extensive and effective internet censorship systems, tightly controlling what users can see and quickly scrubbing content. Pornography remains illegal in China.Despite stringent internet controls like real-name verification and the Great Firewall that blocks access to many foreign websites, cyberattacks are not uncommon in China.The country’s internet regulator rolled out new rules in September mandating online platforms’ prompt and detailed reporting of security breaches to the authorities.Wang Liejun, a cybersecurity expert at QAX, attributed the scale of the damage largely to the use of “automated attacks,” noting that many online platforms still rely on traditional, manual defense models.Hackers use automated tools to register accounts in bulk and control bot networks, allowing prohibited content to be released and spread within seconds – far beyond the limits of what manual review systems can handle, Wang told state-run media The Paper.The incident comes amid a controversial law amendment that has sparked heated online debate over tighter restrictions and higher fines for spreading obscene content on the internet.Some local media this week reported that the new rules, set to take effect next year, would criminalize even forwarding such photos or videos to individuals, including friends and spouses in private chats, triggering massive online backlash.There is no evidence linking the cyberattack to this amendment. However, state broadcaster CCTV stepped in on Wednesday to clarify that the notion that “‘sending obscene photos to friends counts as a crime’ is a misinterpretation” of the law, citing various legal experts.Yue Shenshan, an attorney at Beijing Yuecheng Law Firm quoted by CCTV, said that sending obscene content to friends was already technically illegal under the original law, though in practice, such behavior is not punished if no one reports it.Over the past few days, Hu Xijin, a prominent nationalist commentator, repeatedly voiced his opposition to punishing such private exchanges on Weibo.“At the level of grassroots social governance, treating all sexual content, including ambiguous or suggestive material, as something to be completely eradicated should not be seen as correct,” he said in a post on Wednesday.",

    "details": "More specifically, Cloud Dancer - a white described as \"lofty\" and \"billowy\" that \"serves as a symbol of calming influence in a society rediscovering the value of quiet reflection\".It is the first time white has been chosen as the colour of the year, and it has raised more than a few eyebrows.According to Pantone, Cloud Dancer \"is not just a colour, it's a mindset\" and reflects a collective desire to slow down, reset and find calm after years of visual overload.But some critics have labelled the decision as \"Pantonedeaf\", arguing that elevating minimalist and pristine white spaces can feel far removed from the smaller, messier homes most people inhabit.Others argue that positioning white as aspirational risks racial undertones, landing uncomfortably amid ongoing political and cultural conversations about race and representation.Designer Chris Beaumont says the backlash goes beyond aesthetics, arguing that white carries cultural undertones and is rarely a neutral choice.\"White is a signal,\" he says, shaped by a decade of minimalist celebrity interiors – most notably Kim Kardashian's stripped-back home – that came to represent \"wealth, order and distance from chaos\".He explains that white is \"not about inspiration but being careful not to offend\", with Cloud Dancer embodying \"austerity, moral minimalism and the idea that neutrality signifies virtue\".\"Overnight they became our offices, sanctuaries and emotional anchors,\" he says, adding that against this backdrop, pushing the Colour of the Year towards \"further visual emptiness feels rather tone-deaf\".Rather than offering calm, he believes white now risks amplifying \"a sense of bleakness\", particularly when paired with cool, clinical lighting.Lara Clarke, a Surrey based interior designer, agrees and says Cloud Dancer \"doesn't really read as a colour\" and is \"firmly in the bin for me\".While it may suit highly minimal or architectural spaces, she says bright whites rarely create calm in real homes.She adds that \"homes should spark joy and feel warm and lived-in, and this shade feels quite removed from that.\"Beaumont hopes that homeowners will reject the Pantone Colour of the Year in favour of \"full-scale dopamine décor\", using colour to express personality.Laurie Pressman, VP of the Pantone Colour Institute, told the BBC that people \"bring different feelings\" to the meaning of the colour, but it was chosen as it \"works seamlessly with everything around it, offering a refined neutrality that feels intentional and adaptable\".Past choices have included the optimism of Living Coral, the calm confidence of Classic Blue, the vibrancy of Viva Magenta, and most recently softer, emotionally driven tones like Peach Fuzz.These colours don't just live on trend forecasts - they show up in fashion collections, beauty launches, interiors, packaging and even technology, shaping how products are marketed and how consumers imagine the year ahead.Victoria Robinson, a style and trend expert, says Cloud Dancer is a \"beautiful choice\" and while it may seem simple, \"this particular shade feels soft and elegant rather than stark\".In contrast to those who say the colour is boring, Robinson sees it as \"adaptable\" and says it's best used in \"bedrooms and living areas where you want a serene, restful atmosphere\".\"Even if you don't want to repaint, you can introduce the colour into a room with cushions, throws and curtains.\"Interior designer James Mellan-Matulewicz says although he was surprised that Pantone's pick this year was \"essentially the absence of colour\", it is a bit like vanilla ice cream, in that \"everyone likes it but it's nobody's favourite\".He can see its merits, explaining that white can work particularly well as a backdrop for architectural details like panelling and arched doorways which is a \"growing trend in modern homes\".In fashion, white has long been a staple rather than a statement and as a Colour of the Year it presents a different challenge to designers more accustomed to bold shades.Luxury stylist Oriona Robb says elevating white feels \"less about novelty and more about intention\", reflecting a shift towards refinement after years of trend overloads.\"White forces designers and wearers alike to focus on form, proportion and quality, there's really nowhere to hide,\" she explains.But she adds that it also carries assumptions around body confidence, lifestyle and privilege, saying: \"When white is treated as something only a narrow group of people can pull off, it becomes exclusionary.\"She says industry is already aware of the uncomfortable undertones tied to celebrating white as an ideal, particularly amid ongoing conversations about representation and accessibility, and the real test will be whether \"brands engage with that nuance honestly, or simply aestheticise the colour\".Stylist Katie Malik admits the choice initially surprised her, given Pantone's history of bold colours, but says it reflects a genuine shift and fits within a wider mood of \"quiet luxury\", burnout and a rejection of excess.She says feedback from her clients has been largely positive, with many craving calmer, more restorative spaces.\"Many people are actively seeking tranquillity and serenity in their homes and aren't always ready to commit to more daring colours,\" she explains.Whether white feels calming or sterile, Malik argues, depends on how it is used and far from being \"Pantonedeaf\", she sees it as one of Pantone's most usable picks.Cloud Dancer is described as a blank canvas that allows \"all colours to shine\", a view Malik shares.Adding that its success \"won't be in its universal adoption, but in how it anchors a larger conversation about what we want from our homes\".For those tempted to embrace Cloud Dancer in all its pristine glory, one thing may be essential: a very good stain remover, kept firmly within reach.Hailed as a visionary, the Yorkshireman will be remembered for his sculptured silhouettes and theatricality.",

    "details": "Salt, fat, acid and heat are the essential elements of cooking to Samin Nosrat, who transformed them into her best-selling cookbook and popular Netflix series, “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.”Before she mentions even a single recipe in “Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share With People You Love — A Cookbook,” Nosrat shares a spread of her “unexpectedly essential” kitchen gear, which includes one piece she used to dread but now adores: the immersion blender.Nosrat’s culinary career began at Chez Panisse, where she worked her way up from food runner to cook over two years. Nosrat was often on soup duty at Alice Waters’ acclaimed Berkeley, California, bistro, which was a trailblazer in the farm-to-table movement.At home, you’re making much less soup, Nosrat conceded, but those messy, fussy memories were hard for her to erase. For years, every time she saw an immersion blender, she would have a visceral reaction. “I had this dread in my stomach,” she said. “The idea of blending a soup was restaurant-sized dread, even when it was applied to a home-sized meal.”All of that changed when Nosrat realized she could skip a step. Frustrated after one too many countertop blender mishaps spilling on her clothes or spraying the contents onto the ceiling, Nosrat decided to stick with the stick blender while developing a recipe for butternut squash and green curry soup.“I’m just at home and not trying to serve this to people in fine dining circumstances, so I figured it might be fine. It was, and that single recipe changed everything,” Nosrat said.In fact, the immersion blender breakthrough was so impactful that Nosrat decided to pay tribute to that creation with the Curried Carrot and Coconut Soup that stars in her latest cookbook (recipe below).“Once I realized that creamy soup does just fine with the immersion blender only, it felt like a liberation,” she added.As soon as the handheld blender was back in her good graces, Nosrat discovered two more stellar uses: for whipping up quick mayos and salad dressings.“I have grown to love using it for making a small amount of an emulsion,” she said, referring to the process of mixing two liquids that normally don’t like to combine.“If I were doing it by hand, I’d have to invest a ton of time and energy to whisk it,” Nosrat said. “Using a narrow jar and the immersion blender, it comes together quickly and easily since the blade is small and the ingredients are much closer together and more compressed than they would be in a large bowl.”The same secret comes in clutch for salad dressings such as a Caesar or the creamy oregano dressing in “Good Things.” Besides being quick and easy to emulsify, “the idea that I can make the dressing in the same jar that I store it in has been a revelation for me,” she added. Just add a lid and pop any extra in the refrigerator for tomorrow.As far as what brand to buy, Nosrat said she has relied on a Vitamix Immersion Blender for five years, “and it’s just so powerful.” That said, feel free to invest in whatever model fits your budget, she said. While powerful tools can simplify certain tasks, the most important part is making any adjustments required so it’s easier to step inside the kitchen and create something nourishing.“‘Good Things’ is about the gratification of getting to use your hands and creating something in a world that is committed to separating us from the act of making something,” Nosrat said. “There are so many forces that digitize and take away the opportunity to be part of the creation process from start to finish. I do think there’s something so essential in that. Cooking gives us an opportunity to do this any day.”Don’t let the lengthy ingredient list scare you away from making this cozy meal, which is inspired by Nosrat’s butternut squash soup revelation and spicy, punchy Thai red curries. The garnish is optional but highly recommended and described as a “real standout” by Nosrat. The crunchy, savory sprinkle is a twist on a popular snack across Thailand and Laos called miang kham.For this or any creamy soup, “you want to put an immersion blender in a pot that’s not super full, because the blender will incorporate air into the base of the pot as it’s blending. That will increase the volume of the soup,” Nosrat advised.Reach for a large enough vessel so the volume of the soup fills it no more than two-thirds of the way to the top and insert the immersion blender at a slight angle so it doesn’t create a vacuum seal on the bottom — and so that the soup and fiber can swim around the pot.",

    "details": "The US is immediately pausing leases for offshore wind energy projects currently being built near the Atlantic coastline, citing security concerns.In a statement, the Department of the Interior said it was pausing five large-sale projects to look into how windmills could interfere with radar and create other risks to east coast cities.President Donald Trump has long opposed wind energy, saying it is unreliable and drives up costs, and attempted to stop all projects when he returned to office. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has said wind farms have no future in the US energy grid.Renewable energy companies, as well as state leaders, have expressed alarm over the administration's stance.In its statement, the Department of the Interior said the pause \"addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centres\".The five wind farms now on pause are being constructed off the coast of New York, Virginia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.Specifically, the announcement noted that officials are concerned about radar interference \"clutter\" that can obscure real moving targets or, conversely, create false ones. It added that a radar's threshold for false-alarm detection could be increased to reduce some clutter, but only at the risk of missing actual targets.The wind projects could make it difficult to \"determine what's friend and foe in our airspace\", Burgum said in an interview with Fox Business on Monday, where he cited drone strikes between Russia and Ukraine and between Iran and Israel as examples.Dominion Energy, the company behind the Virginia wind farm, said its project is far offshore and \"does not raise visual impact concerns.\"\"The project's two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security,\" it said in a statement.Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, a Democrat, described the pause as an \"erratic\" move that \"will drive up the price of electricity in Connecticut and throughout the region\".\"This project is nearing completion and providing good-paying clean energy jobs,\" he added. \"Businesses and residents deserve economic predictability, yet with the administration's constant starts and stops they're left with the opposite.\"Earlier in December, a federal judge struck down an attempt by President Trump to ban new wind power projects in the US, calling it \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law\".On the first day of his administration in January, Trump issued a memorandum halting permits and new leases until a federal review could be undertaken.Demand in the US for energy is expected to significantly expand in the years ahead, driven by the needs of artificial intelligence firms.Last week, Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social that is majority-owned by the president, said it was getting into the energy business, announcing a merger with a fusion firm TAE Technologies.Five people are still unaccounted for but crews have rescued multiple people from the partially collapsed building, officials say.The Trump administration argues the deployment is essential for the safety of immigration enforcement agents.The largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the justice department included some notable messages and several mentions of Trump.Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, says a \"witch hunt\" is taking place.",

In a statement, the Department of the Interior said it was pausing five large-sale projects to look into how windmills could interfere with radar and create other risks to east coast cities. President Donald Trump has long opposed wind energy, saying it is unreliable and drives up costs, and attempted to stop all projects when he returned to office.  Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has said wind farms have no future in the US energy grid.",

    "details": "As millions of Americans hit the road or take to the skies for the holidays, another seasonal traveler is picking up speed: influenza.Those numbers mean the virus may be closer to home than many families realize. Holiday gatherings could include someone just recovering from the flu, or someone beginning to feel sick. Should they still show up to open presents on Christmas morning? How long should a visit be postponed before heading to grandma’s to bake cookies?“Particularly if you’re a person in a high-risk group,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.Flu symptoms usually start suddenly with fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, Dr. Pamela Lindor, a pediatrician at Bluebird Kids Health in Jacksonville, Florida, said in an email.While you should quickly start treatment and avoid exposing others when you test positive for flu, “if the over the counter test is negative but your symptoms are severe, consider getting a more accurate test from your doctor or urgent care center,” she said.Testing is key because once it is determined which respiratory illness you have, you can then receive appropriate treatment, Schaffner said.“Flu is not the only illness we’re concerned about. Maybe you have Covid, and if you have Covid, we have another medication that could help keep you out of the hospital,” he said.Flu antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu or Xofluza, are prescription medications, and they work best when started early, ideally within two days after flu symptoms begin.As soon as someone starts to show symptoms, they should stay home and avoid contact with other people to not spread the virus.Some people who have symptoms or fever might be tempted to still visit family or open Christmas gifts with loved ones, as long as they wear a mask, but Schaffner still warned against it.“Even if you say, ‘Well, I have these symptoms, but I’ll wear a mask.’ Yes, that will reduce the chance of spreading but not reduce it to zero. And guess what? It’s very hard to eat and drink with a mask on,” he said. “So, you will indeed be exposing people. And when you get to family members, even when you wear that mask, they’ll be hugging and kissing. These are very close circumstances, so you’ve got to restrain yourself and separate yourself, otherwise you are very much in danger of becoming a dreaded spreader.”While someone with flu should take precautions to isolate themselves and not expose others, there are important steps their household members also can take to reduce their risk of getting sick.“Good handwashing is very important to prevent spread,” Lindor said. “Common surfaces in the house should be disinfected.”Some doctors may prescribe antiviral medications to people who have been exposed to someone with flu, but they are not yet showing signs or symptoms themselves, especially if that person is in a high-risk group.“Their grandfather is obviously in a high-risk group. Should the grandfather take Tamiflu for five days? That’s not a bad idea,” Schaffner said. “In that circumstance, it could very well avert the influenza infection.”It’s important to stay in contact with your doctor once you test positive for flu and experience worsening symptoms, especially if you are in a high-risk group, Schaffner said.“For all those people out there who are still well, if you haven’t been vaccinated, please get the vaccine. Don’t linger,” Schaffner said.“That’s a holiday present to you and to everyone else around you,” he said. “There’s more than one kind of influenza virus out there, and the vaccine helps prevent serious disease due to three different types of influenza virus.”Lindor said that overall, the best way to avoid having the flu disrupt family gatherings during the holidays is “for all family members to get their flu vaccine early in the flu season each year.”",

    "details": "President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new class of battleships bearing his name puts a fresh spotlight on a US naval shipbuilding program that has fallen short on delivering the new warships on time and on budget in recent years, something Trump himself pointed out in his speech from Mar-a-Lago on Monday.“We make the greatest equipment in the world, by far, nobody’s even close. But we don’t produce them fast enough,” Trump said, as he announced he would meet soon with top US military contractors to ramp up production for the new battleships and other weapons programs.But at least in the battleship plan, the Navy would seem to be swimming upstream, with construction of the vessels themselves and some of the weapon systems the service says would be aboard.A US Navy fact sheet released Monday says the Trump class will be “the most lethal warship to ever be built.”Other armaments would include a rail gun, five-inch conventional guns, and a range of lasers and smaller guns.The administration has given no timeframe for how long it will take for the design phase – which the president said he will personally be involved in – or the building of the first two ships.The new battleships project would be led by a naval shipbuilding base that has struggled to deliver in recent years and which Navy Secretary John Phelan said this year was in disarray.Then last month Phelan axed the Constellation-class frigate program, which was about three years behind schedule and was expected to yield much smaller and less complex warships than the new battleships Trump now proposes.As far as large complex ships go, the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, the USS John F Kennedy, has slipped about two years behind its scheduled delivery date, which was July of this year. Those delays have been attributed to new landing and weapons elevator systems which the service is still trying to get certified.Then there’s the question of who will build these new battleships. US shipyards are already stretched thin with current construction, maintenance and overhaul jobs.“We no longer have the shipbuilding and maritime industrial infrastructure to do this quickly,” said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.Ships the size of the Trump-class would need the same dockyard space as large amphibious and logistical support ships the Navy also needs, so closed shipyards would need to be reactivated or new ones built, Schuster said.“A national scale recruitment and training program for shipyard, electrical, information and sensor system workers (would be) required to support this program,” Schuster said.Navy Secretary Phelan just recently pointed out the difficulties in recruiting a workforce, especially when it comes to pay.If workers can make the same money working in an Amazon warehouse or a convenience store, they’re less likely to choose the he arduous, backbreaking jobs found in a naval shipyard, he told a defense conference in Indiana last month.Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College London, said Washington has the technical know-how to make these ships, but it must overcome the shipyard problem.“The question is … whether the US has a sufficient shipyard capacity and workforce to translate a visual gold fleet into a real sailing one,” he said.Trump said Monday the new battleships ships would eventually replace the Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the backbone of the US surface fleet.Schuster noted the Navy’s sketchy record on seeing ambitious shipbuilding programs followed through to completion.And, as Schuster points out, recent shipbuilding programs that have reached plan numbers have fallen well short of overall success, specifically the Littoral Combat Ships. That program, which has produced more than three dozen hulls, has seen some of them retired with as little as five years of service as they’ve been plagued by reliability issues and a lack of a well-defined mission.Rail gun tech uses electromagnetic power to propel a hardened projectile at speeds far higher than current weapon systems - but it requires huge amounts of power and most programs around the world have made little progress so far towards a commercially viable, reliable weapon.Schuster says the Trump administration also needs to make some changes in management if it wants the Trump class to be successful.“This project will be managed by NAVSEA (Naval Sea Systems Command), an organization and staff that has screwed up every surface warship program of this century,” he said.“I believe Trump must clean house in that organization if he wants any shipbuilding program to succeed.”“The US Navy is not known for being at the forefront of automation and innovative solutions in terms of more compact crew management.”Doing so “will require a cultural shift – in light of other new classes being built – of no trifling proportions,” Patalano said.Should the Navy be able to get a fleet of Trump-class battleships into the water, there’s still a question of whether they’ll be suitable for the missions at hand.Some analysts say Washington should be focusing on large numbers of small naval vessels, capable of carrying a few missiles or drones each, and dispersing them across a vast range of waterways, negating Beijing’s advantage in missile numbers by presenting too many targets to handle.Like the carriers, large battleships could be putting too much firepower on one platform, critics say.“The advantages of small battleships and unmanned systems are that the quantity can be increased at a relatively low cost and viability can be increased by dispersing risk across multiple platforms,” said Yu Jihoon, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses and former South Korean submarine officer.And large ships aren’t only vulnerable to missiles, some say. There’s also a question of how they can deal with drones, cheap unmanned platforms in the air and on and below the sea, that Ukraine has shown during its war with Russia can at least disable if not sink surface ships and submarines alike.China displayed an array of undersea naval drones at a military parade in Beijing in September, watched by leader Xi Jinping, who was flanked by Russian leader Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Writing on the website Naval News this month, analyst H I Sutton said large Chinese drones could be used to lay mines that could choke off US naval ports around the Pacific. If the proposed US battleships can’t get to sea, they’re not going to be able to bring their offensive firepower into play.That’s a long list of challenges to the proposed Trump-class battleship program, but analysts say Washington should not be counted out.After all, as Trump said in his speech on Monday, this is the country that ramped up military production enough during World War II to turn out multiple ships in a single day.But Schuster doesn’t think the US can do it alone this time. Allies are needed, something difficult to manage when it comes to the laws governing current US naval shipbuilding.“The PLAN (China’s navy) is nearing the ability to challenge our access to the Western Pacific, a direct and clear threat to our national security. Since it also poses a threat to Japan and South Korea, enlisting their help to meet that challenge is a necessary solution to the problem,” Schuster said.That allied cooperation is in early stages, but seeds have been planted. Trump on Monday praised South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, which is investing billions into the Philly Shipyard, which could be building future US Navy ships.",

President Donald Trump’s landmark tax and spending cuts package – the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – passed earlier this year, placed new caps on the amount students can borrow in federal student loans for graduate school and how much parents can borrow to help pay students’ tuition. It also eliminated certain deferments on student loans and created a much more limited set of repayment options.And earlier this month, the Trump administration announced an agreement to end the SAVE plan, a Biden-era repayment plan that has faced legal challenges for years, affecting nearly 8 million borrowers. If approved in federal court, borrowers will have a “limited time” – the amount not yet outlined – to enroll in a new plan.Borrowers in default can no longer receive deferment or forbearance, which allow borrowers to temporarily stop making payments on loans, according to the Department of Education’s website. They will also no longer have the ability to choose a repayment plan. The department has urged borrowers to contact the student aid office’s Default Resolution Group.For borrowers who are facing severe financial stress, it’s possible to discharge loans in bankruptcy if they meet certain criteria.",

Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will keep fans updated on what’s ahead.”The PGA Tour, while not offering any substance, took the rare step of acknowledging the move involving a player who is no longer a member.“Brooks Koepka is a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success,” the tour said in a statement. “The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which to pursue greatness.”Koepka had alerted the PGA Tour of his plans before the LIV announcement, according to one person aware of communication. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it has not been publicly disclosed.A blunt speaker, Koepka had expressed frustration earlier in the year that LIV wasn’t as far along as he hoped it would be.His departure leaves DeChambeau and Jon Rahm, both two-time major champions, as the biggest draws in the league that also includes Ryder Cup player Tyrrell Hatton.The league also is awaiting word on its application to become part of the Official World Golf Ranking system.

    "details": "Messages reveal how the agency has raced to satisfy the White House by pumping out videos of confrontations and arrests.For the Immigration and Customs Enforcement public affairs team, the nighttime operation across metro Houston in October was a gold mine.Across thousands of internal ICE messages reviewed by The Washington Post, this kind of celebration has become commonplace. The messages show how the team has worked closely with the White House, which has urged them to produce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.Before officials could post the Houston video, they had to figure out how to frame it. Officials did not know if all the arrestees had criminal records, they wrote in the chats, undermining a slogan the team had worked to promote on social media: that ICE targeted the “Worst of the Worst.”We made several dozen arrests today very quickly. Not sure if these all had criminal histories beyond being in the US illegally.I’d like to try to put this out without focusing on the aliens or their crimes, but to demonstrate that we’re out working hard.Instead of arguing they’d snared hardened criminals, officials wrote a caption saying the arrests showed the dangers of “illegal aliens … behind the wheel.”They settled on a rap song by Nbhd Nick, which his label would later tell The Post was used without permission, that starts, “Oh, you thought this was a game, huh?”For years, this ICE team had run like a routine government communications shop, dispensing public service announcements and news releases few Americans would see. But during President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE’s public affairs arm has rapidly transformed into an influencer-style media machine, churning out flashy videos of tactical operations and immigration raids.The internal communications reviewed by The Post show how the ICE team has coordinated with the White House, working to satisfy Trump aides’ demands to “flood the airwaves,” as one official urged in the messages, with brash content showing immigrants being chased, grabbed and detained.They also show federal officials mocking immigrants in crass terms and discussing video edits that might help legitimize the administration’s aggressive stance. The team also knowingly used copyright-protected music without permission from the rights holders, among other techniques designed to boost their online attention.Six current or former officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs ICE, told The Post that the video effort had broken from the more careful and methodical work of past administrations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.The Post reviewed chats and other materials provided by people familiar with internal discussions. They did so on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the disclosures.David Lapan, the first DHS press secretary during Trump’s first term and a longtime critic who has argued the second Trump administration politicized the agency, said the current strategy is unrecognizable compared to the more “professional and buttoned-up” operations under past presidents that worked to describe law enforcement activities clinically and apolitically, for fear of inflaming anger against agents in the field.“We were supposed to present the facts, not hype things up. But this veers into propaganda, into creating fear,” said Lapan, a retired Marine Corps colonel. “We didn’t have this meme-ification of various serious operations, these things that are life or death. … It’s not a joking matter. But that’s the way they’re treating it now.”White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “President Trump and his entire team are working at breakneck speed to keep our promises, deport criminal illegal aliens, and get information out to the public — that’s a good thing and the American people deserve no less.”DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the White House had given the communications wings of DHS and ICE “autonomy to create content that is effectively reaching the American public.” The social media posts that used copyrighted material without permission had been preapproved by administration lawyers, she said.DHS public affairs officials, she added, were proud to break with the strategies of past administrations because their work has proved more successful at getting people’s attention.Their public affairs divisions employed small teams of video producers, mostly for unexceptional tasks: facilitating TV interviews, running the cameras at workforce retirement ceremonies, recording safety commercials for the Super Bowl. Some producers traveled to make videos when DHS agents took down sex abusers or crime rings. Video producers would film targeted operations, a current DHS official said, but immigration enforcement was only a fraction of the workload.DHS’s media operation was no exception. Public affairs teams were injected with a new crew of political appointees who had orders from the White House to treat immigration as their top priority and produce dramatized visuals of ICE operations and arrests to command user attention, the current and former officials told The Post. The video teams’ workload exploded, and immigration became the only topic anyone could pursue, according to interviews.“We’re not doing child pornography cases. We’re not doing human trafficking cases,” one current DHS official told The Post. “Everything is immigration.”ICE’s public affairs team included several dozen public affairs officers, producers and strategists, scattered between its Washington headquarters and local field offices across the country, current DHS officials said. Members of ICE’s visual communications team, embedded in the public affairs division and known as “viscom,” began recording in the field more frequently, accompanying officers on raids and removal operations, shooting video day and night, interviews and chats showed. Any video producer who witnessed a particularly cinematic scene was expected to alert their supervisors, so the agency and the White House could promote it on their social media channels. Employees on ICE’s “digital engagement” team then raced to edit and post the footage on social media in hopes of securing a viral win.Emily Covington, ICE’s assistant director for public affairs, frequently requested “good arrest videos” and asked the team to devote its energy to capturing “high profile arrests,” the internal messages show. Laszlo Baksay, a deputy assistant director, asked the public affairs team in the chat to flag stories where “aliens with criminal history are being employed,” to counter media reports that the agency was grabbing “ordinary aliens just trying to earn a living.”The team began working like a professional influencer operation, creating a “social media check list” of caught-on-camera arrests, sharing metrics with senior officials, using paid social media tracking tools and cataloguing all of their Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads and X posts, ranked by impressions and engagement rate.Covington pushed the team in internal chats in late May to be more “proactive” in pushing out videos.What PR tactics can we deploy that we don’t typically? Should we feed info to an influencer? ... Using judgment to ID something likely to go viral or bubble up and gain attention. Right now we are learning from the media, let’s feed the beast first with the good work ICE is doing each and every day.A week after Covington’s message, in late May, the team got its first viral video. The clip showed ICE agents leaping out of an SUV and confronting men on the curb of a home improvement store in Baltimore. The men were shoved face down onto the street and handcuffed while an agent said, “Calle la boca” — in Spanish, “shut your mouth.” In an X post, ICE called the video “action-packed.”But the real celebration came shortly after, when the White House reposted the video on its Instagram and X accounts, labeling it an “EPIC Takedown.”The post, from one of the team’s political appointees, led to a burst of hearts and shock-face emojis.As the media operation ramped up, DHS posted several videos containing clear errors around their operations, using misleading footage that showed scenes recorded thousands of miles away from where the video described, The Post has previously reported.Other edits were aimed at presenting events in ways that supported the administration’s narratives. In May, Covington asked, at the White House’s request, whether a video of a deportation flight from Texas could be re-edited so that the clips “don’t feature tons of females?” An ICE official responded that a video producer would “re-edit the b-roll to exclude the females,” the chats show.Officials worked to find ways to describe many of the people arrested as the “Worst of the Worst,” a slogan DHS and ICE began using in January to argue that their agents hunted only the most dangerous criminals. When one official asked in the chat what producers should say in their videos when arrestees had no criminal history, another responded that they should work to find something else “newsworthy” to highlight, like an “egregious immigration history.”Public affairs officers were told to rewrite their news releases and online posts with stronger, more aggressive language if they wanted the agency’s main communications channels to promote them, one said in an interview. “If the truth of the operation does not match the narrative of the ‘worst of the worst,’ it’s going to be killed,” the official said.The team gave right-wing media figures premium access to immigration operations and received favorable coverage. In June, about three months before he was killed, right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk posted what he said was “exclusive footage” of ICE officials arresting a “thug.” Covington highlighted the moment in the team’s chat, thanking one official “for getting great footage on today’s arrest.”A Libs of TikTok representative declined to comment on the relationship. Representatives for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, and Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of McGraw said he had been invited by White House border czar Tom Homan to document ICE enforcement in Chicago and Los Angeles earlier this year.In pursuit of more viral video, DHS brought in new public affairs staff members with atypical backgrounds and authorized them to “go out and capture content,” as a chat message said. A MAGA women’s lifestyle influencer, an L.A.-based wedding videographer and a Canadian-born actor who played a “mountain man” in a cable-TV show joined the team.DHS encouraged the hires to become intimately involved with agency affairs, the chats and interviews showed. In June, when ICE agents were raiding farms in rural Missouri, the former actor noted it would be a prime chance to make a video. “Would be great to get something like that on film,” he wrote in the chats, suggesting a tagline: “We are everywhere, we will find you.”Later, when ICE officials complained about negative media coverage, he worked to bolster their spirits.The good news is half the country is seeing it, and equally as frustrated. those in the “middle” are who we will continue to slowly reach... It’s a war!By June, the public affairs team had for weeks been showing signs of overwork, with some employees consistently working overtime to help satisfy the White House’s constant demands for more content, the chat messages showed.The team had discussed bringing on contract videographers to help address outstanding tasks — like a new request to shadow every operation of ICE’s Special Response Team, the elite SWAT-like unit that handles its most dangerous arrests.All- as expected, I am getting pressure now about our video capabilities. I need ALL video our PAOs and videographers have captured this week ASAP in one link. This should be the only priority for right now.We need all hands on deck to start “flooding the airwaves” per White house direction on ALL ICE arrests nationwide today. The request is to flood social and traditional media with imagery of ICE arrests.The National Guard deployment presented a challenge for a unit trained to cover preplanned and targeted operations: a vast, citywide video shoot where clashes with protesters could flare up at any time.My thought would be for locals to post and the HQ can re-tweet, unless there is something really juicy that would get more push coming from HQ.On White House Call - we need to be highlighting worst of worst LA arrests across relevant accounts/channels. I will be getting a LOT of content from all federal partners today. All flowing through me now.ICE began to post a flurry of tweets on X in quick succession — almost every half hour. They included visuals of recent immigration raids and mug shots of people the agency said were undocumented immigrants with a criminal history.Officials also floated more ideas to maximize coverage, including pulling in military videographers, known as “combat cameras,” to offer “direct support of designated hotspots.” One official warned the idea came with too many risks, in part because they had been trained for battle, not protests. “It’s different than war photography in a few distinct ways,” the official said.The White House directive around the L.A. protests forced the agency to play more of an “attack-dog” role online to keep up with the administration’s demands, one former worker on the DHS media team told The Post.“That was the turning point to get even more aggressive with their messaging, and to paint pictures of these places as war-torn,” he said. “There was a much more blustery edge, and a need to put stuff out as quickly as you can. You’re steamrolling everything.”DHS knows we have very little staff right? I know it has been discussed but there has been no change to our staffing and they keep wanting more and more.When video producers weren’t available, public affairs officers were sent into the field to record ICE activities on their phones — a footage “force multiplier,” one DHS official said in an interview. Officers were traveling more to fill the White House’s almost insatiable demand for visuals, another official said.The push, however, left some of the officials fearful for their safety in the field. In July, DHS said, an ICE public affairs specialist was sent to the emergency room with a bloodied hand after being hit by a thrown rock outside a California marijuana farm.During an all-team meeting attended by public affairs officers, an official said he had been sent in a T-shirt to scenes where agents were wearing body armor, an ICE official recalled. (An ICE spokesman said the agency now ensures that public affairs officials have protective equipment, including body armor and first aid kits.)Still, public affairs officials have participated in the immigration operations. In September, Covington said in an internal chat message that she had been on a ride-along with federal agents when an immigrant from Venezuela was apprehended. “Target was a runner - I spotted him and we made the arrest,” she wrote.She uploaded photos of the man in handcuffs and asked in the chat whether he had been a known gang member, saying he “had some interesting tats.” An ICE legal associate told her their files showed no evidence of gang membership. Some of her colleagues congratulated her nonetheless. “Go [Public Affairs Office] Go!” one replied.The White House’s frenzy for more content, and DHS officials’ scramble to produce, led the team to push the boundaries in ways that disturbed some of its employees.ICE’s X account posted a video of a bound protester in Portland, Ore., being wheeled into custody face down on a flatbed cart, with the background lyrics, “they see me rollin’.” DHS’s account posted a clip of Illinois protesters and said, “Get a job you imbecilic morons.” It also shared a Halloween-styled montage of arrestees’ mug shots and warned there would be “no sanctuary for creatures & criminals of the night.”“They just went nuts,” a recently departed DHS producer told The Post. “It was no limit. … It was like if someone from Reddit took over.”Some prosecutors in U.S. attorneys’ offices complained to public affairs officials that the brash social media posts could jeopardize their cases by raising questions about bias or tainting the jury pool, one official said. (McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said she’d not heard this and said that if officials are so concerned about it, they should convey it to her, not journalists.)McLaughlin said that every organization has “conversations that you don’t think are going to get out to the public” but that she is not “going to lose sleep over” anything in the messages.ICE’s shifting attitude toward public messaging was especially noticeable in its use of music without the artists’ or labels’ permission, current and former DHS officials said, which past administrations had been far more cautious about. Some officials said in the chat that they were indifferent to the potential perils. When one employee raised concerns about copyright violations, another wrote back, dismissing them.At least five DHS and ICE videos have been taken down from X in recent months following complaints from representatives of the comedian Theo Von, the band MGMT, and rappers Jay-Z, Joey Valence, and Chamillionaire. Other companies and creators have complained that their intellectual property was used without permission, including the Pokémon Co., whose cartoon style was mimicked for a DHS video captioned “Gotta Catch ’Em All.”Trump administration officials have defended the intensity of their media operation to reporters by saying it’s what Americans want: visual proof that Trump is fulfilling his promise to deport millions of immigrants nationwide.Despite this, the media operations at DHS show no signs of slowing down. Inside the ICE team, the chats showed, many were proud of their work — and committed for the long haul.Reporting by Joyce Sohyun Lee and Drew Harwell. Jeremy B. Merrill contributed to this report.

    "details": "Lithium-ion batteries are found in everything from smartphones to cars, and while they are generally very safe if stored and charged correctly, there are thousands of documented cases of them catching fire — sometimes with deadly consequences.Lithium-ion batteries contain flammable electrolytes — liquid solutions of lithium salts dissolved in organic solvents that allow the electric charge to flow. The batteries can become unstable under certain conditions, such as physical damage like piercing, overcharging, extreme temperatures or manufacturing defects. When things go wrong, a battery can heat up and catch fire very rapidly, undergoing a dangerous chain reaction called a “thermal runaway.”Researchers all over the world are working to solve the problem by developing safer batteries, for example by replacing the liquid electrolyte with a more fire-resistant solid or gel. However, such solutions require significant changes to current production lines, an obstacle to widespread adoption.Now, a team of researchers from The Chinese University of Hong Kong has proposed a change in lithium-ion battery design that could rapidly integrate into current manufacturing methods, because it simply involves swapping chemicals in the existing electrolyte solution.The method was detailed earlier this year in a study led by Yue Sun, now a postdoctoral fellow at Virginia Tech: “I think the most difficult thing for people to realize about batteries is that when you try to optimize performance, sometimes you compromise safety,” she said, explaining that increasing performance requires a focus on chemical reactions that happen at room temperature, while increasing safety focuses on reactions that happen at high temperatures.“So we came up with an idea to break this trade off by designing a temperature-sensitive material, which can provide a good performance at room temperature, but can also offer good stability at high temperatures.”Battery fires generally start when part of the electrolyte breaks down under stress and releases heat in a chain reaction. Sun and her colleagues’ design uses a new electrolyte that includes two solvents to stop this chain reaction in its tracks.At room temperature, the first solvent keeps the battery’s chemical structure tight, optimizing performance, but if the battery starts to heat up, the second solvent takes over and prevents a fire by loosening that structure and slowing down reactions that could result in a thermal runaway.“Since our invention is the electrolyte, it can be easily implemented into commercially available systems — you basically just swap in the new electrolyte,” said Yi-Chun Lu, a professor of mechanical and automation engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and one of the authors of the study.“In the manufacturing process, the most difficult aspect is the electrodes, or the solid part. But the electrolyte that we are swapping is a liquid, so you can directly inject it into the cell without any new equipment or new process,” Lu added.The new chemical recipe would slightly increase the manufacturing cost, but Lu said that at scale, the price would be “at a very similar level” to current batteries. The researchers are interested in pursuing the idea commercially, and are currently in discussion with battery manufacturers to bring the design to market, which could take between three to five years, according to Lu.In tests, the researchers made a battery large enough to power a tablet, but Lu said that there needs to be more “validation” to scale the design up to the size required for cars, for example.Researchers in the field of lithium battery safety who didn’t participate in the study expressed positive views of the work when contacted by CNN for comment. Donal Finegan, a senior scientist at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the new design is an exciting development, and it translates into a safety battery that can tolerate hot conditions and short circuiting without causing a fire: “The strategically chosen electrolyte solution is scalable and does not significantly impede the cycle life of the battery, which helps eliminate many barriers towards mass adoption in commercial battery systems,” he added.The study explored a range of electrolyte compositions and found options where there was a balance between battery cells lasting many cycles while also maintaining stability at higher temperatures, according to Gary Koenig, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia. “From a manufacturing perspective, implementing a new electrolyte can be achieved in a relatively short timeframe as long as there is not an unforeseen processing compatibility issue,” he said in an email.Jorge Seminario, a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M University, said in an email that the new design addresses one of the most critical challenges in high-energy lithium-ion batteries, which is achieving both safety and performance: “The study is highly innovative and impactful, offering a practical solution to a critical bottleneck in lithium-ion battery safety,” he added.Correction:\n A previous version of this story misstated the Fahrenheit values for the battery temperature changes observed in lab tests.",

    "details": "A Jeffrey Epstein survivor who has only ever chosen to identify herself anonymously as “Jane Doe” was startled to learn that her name appeared multiple times in the Justice Department’s release of the Epstein files that began on Friday, and she told CNN in an exclusive interview Monday that her attempts to get the DOJ to redact her name from the publicly available documents had been unsuccessful so far.CNN verified that Jane Doe’s name appears many times in the Epstein files released so far by DOJ. CNN is choosing to only describe Jane Doe’s experience with and allegations against Epstein in broad and agreed-upon terms to protect her identity. She said that since Friday, she has received unsolicited phone calls.Jane Doe alerted DOJ officials over the weekend that her information was not redacted, according to an email exchange viewed by CNN. An official responded that they would convey her message to those handling the documents and redactions. Jane Doe followed up again on Sunday to inform DOJ that her name remained public in the Epstein files. Her name was still viewable in multiple places as of Monday afternoon.In the interview with CNN, Jane Doe said she has been asking federal authorities for her FBI file for years. She said she is mortified that the DOJ failed to properly redact her — and other survivors’ names — and said her entire experience gives her very little confidence in the agency’s ability to protect current and future victims who might report abuse.“The reason I feel so passionate is it’s not just about me and what happened. I fear for the little girl who’s calling the FBI right now and asking for help,” Jane Doe said. “I am so afraid for her, because if I have to do all of this right now… I have no words. I just have no words. It hurts my heart. It haunts me to my core.”Jane Doe was one of more than a dozen survivors — along with family members of the late victim Virginia Giuffre — who issued a new statement Monday raising a myriad of concerns with DOJ’s release of the files. They said that there were “abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation,” some victims’ identities that were left unredacted “causing real and immediate harm,” and that there were no financial documents. The survivors said they have found it “difficult or impossible” to search for materials relevant to their own experiences.CNN reported on Friday in the immediate aftermath of the DOJ’s release that survivors were struggling to navigate the agency’s online “Epstein Library,” and not having much luck finding information about their own cases.“There has been no communication with survivors or our representatives as to what was withheld from release, or why hundreds of thousands of documents have not been disclosed by the legal deadline, or how DOJ will ensure that no more victim names are wrongly disclosed,” the statement says. “While clearer communication would not change the fact that a law was broken, its absence suggests an ongoing intent to keep survivors and the public in the dark as much as possible and as long as possible.”Jess Michaels, an Epstein survivor and a lead writer of the group statement, told CNN in an interview Monday morning that the DOJ’s handling of the release of the files represents “the opposite of transparency.”“There was no one that approached us and said, ‘Hey, we want to do the right thing by survivors. Let’s have a conversation about this,” she said. “It’s that black and white. It’s: the Department of Justice broke a law signed by the president, period.”Asked for comment on the survivors’ Monday statement, DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said: “As the Attorney General has stated, the Department of Justice has been in contact with victims, their lawyers, and victims groups. The DOJ and SDNY are undergoing an arduous effort to protect victims through redactions as documents are released, and the Attorney General encourages victims or their attorneys to come forward with concerns or additional information that could be helpful in the ongoing investigation.”Survivors CNN has spoken with said they have not been contacted by the Justice Department about the Epstein files. Some lawyers representing Epstein victims said they received DOJ outreach to discuss redactions before last week’s release.The DOJ has said that the agency is continuing to work through necessary redactions, and that hundreds of thousands more documents will be released in the coming weeks.Asked what actions, if any, the survivors might take next, she said: “We just want to pause right now and assess.”Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, said on X Monday morning that “the DOJ must stop protecting rich & powerful men who were not charged or those who sabotaged the prosecution.”Khanna called on the DOJ to release, among other things, FBI witness interviews that name other men, and Epstein’s emails seized from his computer.",

    "details": "Some staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs are finding little to be merry about after the agency said it would eliminate tens of thousands of open, unfilled positions across the country as it looks to streamline its staffing.Three sources familiar with the decisions told CNN that leadership at the VA medical facilities they work for first informed them of plans to eliminate the jobs just before Thanksgiving. The positions being eliminated include primary care doctors and nurses, mental health care providers and social workers, among many others.On Monday, multiple facilities held town halls discussing further caps on future jobs, one of the sources said, adding that based on what this person heard, the impression was that “more job cuts are coming.”The person, who works in management at a VA hospital in the Eastern US, told CNN that when the directives to eliminate several hundred open positions at their facilities were issued, they were given only a few days to figure out which positions to cut.The open positions at risk include those at VA hospitals, clinics and so-called Veterans Integrated Service Network offices, or VISNs, which are regional management stations that help deliver services at local VA health care facilities, two sources said.The VA said the cuts are an effort to remove postings for outdated positions that have long been vacant.“All of these positions are unfilled and most have not been filled for more than a year, underscoring how they are no longer needed,” Kasperowicz said, adding that the elimination of those positions would have “zero impact on Veteran care.”Sources who spoke to CNN said the cuts have raised alarm as employees are already facing low morale and staffing shortages in many places.“What freaked us out is that we didn’t expect them to cut mental health providers,” another source, a VA management official in mental health, said.“We were already short on mental health providers,” the person said, warning that cuts to hiring could impact individual veterans seeking mental health care, such as by leading to longer wait times; not having enough providers or only having less-experienced providers available to see patients, since many experienced mental health care providers have left the VA in recent months.The sources say that so far, the plans do not call for people currently occupying VA jobs to be laid off. “They aren’t firing anyone, but all open positions are gone and they may not let us re-fill when people leave,” said one source.Another source said that offers had been made to job candidates for some of the open roles at the facility where they work that are now being eliminated. “It’s hard to be merry,” the person said. “It’s just the constant of it. You can’t catch a break.”",

The document states the three pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb were all viable.Images of the IEDs were included in the document, including a fifth suspected bomb placed in the trunk of the vehicle they used to drive to Bondi to carry out the attack.The pair are also alleged to have recorded videos in which they shared views suggesting they adhered to “religiously motivated violent extremism ideology.”In one video recorded in front of an image of the Islamic State flag, the pair made statements “condemning the acts of Zionists” and appeared to “summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack,” the document added.“There is evidence that the Accused and his father… meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,” the document said.The videos of the men allegedly conducting firearms training in a rural area, believed to be in New South Wales, were allegedly filmed in October. Previously police said they traveled to the Philippines in November, where they stayed for nearly a month and barely left their rooms, a hotel staff member told CNN.“Police allege that this is evidence of reconnaissance and planning of a terrorist act,” the court document said.The elder man’s wife told police she believed he and her son were away on holiday in southern NSW. The son phoned her every day from a payphone to tell her what they planned to do that day, she said, according to the document.Riot police guarded Naveed Akram as he was transferred from Royal North Shore Hospital to an unnamed correctional facility on Monday, NSW Police said. He had been receiving “advanced medical treatment” after being shot in the abdomen, according to the court document.From his hospital bed, he declined a request for a formal police interview on legal advice, the statement said. His next court date is in April.After being booed at a ceremony to mark one week since the terror attack on Sunday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese issued an apology to the Jewish community for what they’d been through.“As prime minister, I feel the weight of responsibility for an atrocity that happened whilst I’m prime minister, and I’m sorry for what the Jewish community and our nation as a whole has experienced,” he said Monday.“This unprecedented radicalization of our youth must stop,” she said. “We will not allow extremists to groom and brainwash our children into hate or terrorism.”So far, Albanese has resisted calls for a federal royal commission –– the country’s highest level of formal inquiry –– from political opponents who say that the government’s plans to review law enforcement and intelligence agencies don’t go far enough.In the aftermath of the shooting, state and federal governments have scrambled to propose new gun laws, with the NSW parliament convening an emergency session on Monday to debate capping the number of firearms recreational license holders can have at four.",

But a new rule by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday will make it impossible for US consumers to buy the next generation of these drones.The FCC banned the import and sale of all new drone models and critical equipment made by foreign manufacturers, including the world’s largest drone maker DJI, by adding them into a so-called “Covered List” of entities deemed to “pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.”The FCC decision, while excluding models already approved for sale and those currently in use, marks a culmination of years-long efforts to clamp down on Chinese drones, such as those produced by DJI and another major drone maker Autel Robotics.In June, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate the commercialization of drone technologies and scale up domestic drone production “against foreign control or exploitation.”“President Trump has been clear that his Administration will act to secure our airspace and unleash American drone dominance,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr on X Monday.“We do so through an action today that does not disrupt the ongoing use or purchase of previously authorized drones and with appropriate avenues for excluding drones that do not pose a risk,” he added.The import, sale or use of existing device models the telecom regulator previously authorized will continue to be allowed and consumers can continue to use any drones previously purchased legally, the FCC said.Over the past year, DJI has written letters to American officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, welcoming scrutiny and the necessary examinations of its products.“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” wrote Adam Welsh, DJI’s Head of Global Policy, in his latest letter earlier this month.But instead of a comprehensive examination the industry and DJI had expected, the FCC said its decision was based on a determination by a White House-convened executive branch interagency body that concluded foreign made drones and components “could enable persistent surveillance, data exfiltration, and destructive operations over US territory.”A DJI spokesperson told CNN Monday that the company is “disappointed” by FCC’s action, saying that “no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.”The spokesperson reiterated their commitment to the US market and product safety backed by independent reviewers.“Concerns about DJI’s data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,” the person added.Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, called the FCC listing “discriminatory” on Tuesday, adding that Beijing opposes Washington’s overgeneralization of national security.“The US should correct its erroneous practices and provide a fair, just, and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies to operate,” he said.Multiple Chinese companies, including tech and telecom giant Huawei and state-owned telecom firm ZTE, have already been included in the FCC’s Covered List for similar national security risks.",

    "details": "Former neighbors paint a mixed portrait of Claudio Neves Valente, whose motives remain a mystery more than a week after police say he killed two Brown University students and an MIT professor, portraying a “very bright” but reclusive young man who was estranged from his family and whose mother once told a neighbor that her son “needs help.”CNN visited the apartment building that Neves Valente, a native of Portugal, lived in as a student more than two decades ago before moving to the United States. The brown, cream and gray high-rise in Olivais, a modest middle-class neighborhood in eastern Lisbon, looks much like others in the area.Residents of his Lisbon neighborhood told CNN the former Ivy League student was extremely smart and polite, but reclusive. At the time he lived there, he was studying at the Instituto Superior Técnico, one of Portugal’s most prestigious engineering schools.Maria Margarida Baptista, a neighbor, recalled working with Neves Valente on administrative tasks for the apartment building, duties assigned to residents for up to three years on a rotating basis. “He was always very diligent” with the math and bills, she told CNN. “Everything in the administration was always very well done.” He would always greet her and address her by name, she added. “I really liked him.”Friend of gunman in Brown and MIT shootings speaks to CNN: ‘I realize maybe the signs were always there’Neighbors say Neves Valente’s reclusiveness extended beyond the community. According to residents, he also avoided contact with his immediate family. His parents would come to visit his apartment, ring the bell, and he wouldn’t open the front door, a woman living nearby who declined to give her name told CNN.Neves Valente’s parents would sometimes hide and wait outside the building, hoping to speak with Neves Valente, the woman said.“He changed the locks. He knew they were around. He wouldn’t leave the house – it was like he was hiding from them.” She said Neves Valente’s mother often relied on her for information.The woman said simply confirming she had seen Neves Valente would bring his mother relief. “She would relax because she knew he was alive,” the neighbor recalled. “All they wanted was to spend time with him, but they never got to see him. He didn’t want to see his parents.”Baptista recalled one occasion when the mother, for unknown reasons, feared that something bad had happened to Neves Valente inside the apartment. “The parents came with firefighters and police to break through the windows to check if he was dead,” she said.They were eventually able to get inside, but he was not home. Neighbors said Neves Valente was extremely upset when he learned his parents had involved the police.The neighbor who declined to be identified recalled a separate occasion when police were called again but did not force entry, stating that Neves Valente was not a minor.Later, the mother confided that she feared her son would sell the apartment and disappear – which eventually happened. “That, for the parents, was devastating,” the neighbor said. “That was the last day his mother came here.”The neighbor, who said she remains in contact with Neves Valente’s parents, said they had not spoken to their son in years. “The parents … are very gentle people,” she said. “They are doing really badly. Neighbors have been helping them. They are quite old, and the news was devastating.”At one point, she recalled, the mother confided without elaborating: “My son needs help, but he doesn’t want to get it.”“He wanted to go. And because there wasn’t anyone who would make themselves available to guide him, (his parents) called me to help him, and that’s what I did,” Morgado said.Speaking to CNN from Torres Nova, near Neves Valente’s hometown of Entroncamento in central Portugal, Morgado described the former student as brilliant and exceptional, adding that he ended up winning the national event and went on to compete in the international physics Olympics in Australia.“I used to say to my colleagues that Claudio was the ‘perfect student.’ During the time I had him as a student, he never deviated from that pattern,” Morgado recalled. “An excellent person with his teachers, his classmates and everyone he interacted with. I never met anyone who said Claudio behaved poorly or wasn’t a good student. In every subject, he performed well.”Like others who knew Neves Valente in Portugal, Morgado said he was shocked to learn about the shootings at Brown University and Massachusetts.",

The brown, cream and gray high-rise in Olivais, a modest middle-class neighborhood in eastern Lisbon, looks much like others in the area. Residents of his Lisbon neighborhood told CNN the former Ivy League student was extremely smart and polite, but reclusive.",
