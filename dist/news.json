Two other bodies – those of Tanzanian and Thai hostages – have also been returned.Photographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks.The forensic team at Nasser hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity.The head of the unit, Dr Ahmed Dheir, said one of their biggest limitations is a lack of cold storage space. The bodies arrive in Gaza thoroughly frozen and can take several days to thaw out, ruling out even basic identification methods like dental history, let alone any deeper investigation or post-mortem (autopsy).\"The situation is extremely challenging,\" he said. \"If we wait for the bodies to thaw, rapid decomposition begins almost immediately, putting us in an impossible position [because] we lose the ability to examine the remains properly. So the most viable method is to take samples and document the state of the bodies as they are.\"The BBC has viewed dozens of photographs of the bodies, many of them shared by Gaza's health authorities, others taken by colleagues on the ground.We spoke to several of those involved in examining the bodies in Gaza, as well as families of the missing, human rights groups, and Israeli military and prison authorities.We also spoke to three forensic experts outside the region, including one specialising in torture, to educate ourselves about the medical processes involved in this kind of investigation – all agreed that there were questions that were difficult to answer without post-mortems.Dr Alaa al-Astal, one of the forensic team at Nasser hospital, said some of the bodies arriving there showed \"signs of torture\", such as bruises and marks from binding on the wrists and ankles.\"There were extremely horrific cases, where the restraint was so tight that blood circulation to the hands was cut off, leading to tissue damage and clear signs of pressure around the wrists and ankles,\" he said.\"Even around the eyes, when the blindfolds were removed, you could see deep grooves - imagine how much force that took. The pressure left actual marks where the blindfold had been tied.\"Dr Astal also mentioned the loose cloths tied around the necks of some bodies as needing further investigation.\"In one case, there was a groove around the neck,\" he said. \"To determine whether the death was due to hanging or strangulation, we needed to perform a post-mortem, but because the body was frozen, it was not dissected.\"Sameh Yassin Hamad, a member of the Hamas-run government committee responsible for receiving the bodies, said there were signs of bruising and blood infiltration indicating that the bodies had been severely beaten before death. He also said there were stab wounds on the chest or face of some of them.Some of the images we saw from the unit clearly show deep indentations or tightly-fastened cable-ties on the wrists and arms and ankles. One photograph appears to show the bruising and abrasion that would confirm that ties had been used while the person was still alive.Other bodies showed only deep indentation marks, meaning a post-mortem would be needed to determine whether the ties had been used before or after death. Cable-ties are sometimes used when transporting bodies in Israel.When we asked Israel's military about the evidence we gathered, it said it operates strictly in accordance with international law.We showed the photographs we were given to the outside forensic experts. The images represent a fraction of the bodies transferred to Gaza by the Red Cross.All three experts said that some of the markings raised questions about what had happened, but that it was difficult to reach concrete conclusions about abuse or torture without  post-mortems.\"What is happening in Gaza is an international forensic emergency,\" said Michael Pollanen, a forensic pathologist and professor at the University of Toronto. \"Based upon images like this, there is an imperative for complete medical autopsies.  We need to know the truth behind how deaths occurred, and the only way to know the truth is to do autopsies.\"But even with limited forensic data, doctors at Nasser hospital say the routine cuffing of wrists behind the body rather than in front, along with the marks observed on the limbs, points to torture.\"When a person is naked, with their hands tied behind their back, and visible restraint marks on their wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position,\" Dr Dheir told us. \"This is a violation of international law.\"And there is strong evidence to suggest widespread abuse of detainees - including civilians - in Israeli custody in the months after the war began in October 2023, particularly in the military facility of Sde Teiman.\"At least in the first eight months of the war, the detainees from Gaza were cuffed behind their backs, and had their eyes covered, 24 hrs, 7 days a week, for months,\" said Naji Abbas, head of the Prisoners and Detainees Programme at the Israeli human rights organisation, Physicians for Human Rights (PHRI).\"We know that people developed serious infections on their skin, hands and legs because of the cuffs.\"We have spoken to several people who worked at Sde Teiman over the past two years, who confirm that detainees were cuffed hand and foot – even while undergoing medical treatments, including surgery.One medic who worked there said he had campaigned to loosen the cuffs, and that the treatment of detainees there was \"dehumanisation\".But many of those detained during the Gaza war are held as unlawful combatants, without charge.One complication for doctors at Nasser Hospital now is determining which of the returned bodies are Hamas fighters killed in combat, which are civilians and which are detainees who died in Israeli custody.Some of the bodies returned by Israel are still wearing Hamas headbands or military boots, but doctors say most are either naked or in civilian clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their role, interpret their injuries, and assess human rights violations.Photographs seen by the BBC show mostly naked or decomposed bodies. One dressed in civilian clothing and trainers has what officials say are two small bullet wounds in his back.Sameh Yassin Hamad, from Gaza's Forensics Committee, said that Israel had sent back identification with only six of the 195 bodies it had returned – and that five of those names turned out to be wrong.\"Since these bodies were held by the Israeli authorities, they will have full data about them,\" said Dr Dheir. \"But they haven't shared that information with us through the Red Cross. We were sent DNA profiles for around half the total number of dead, but have not received any details about the dates or circumstances of death, or the time or place of detention.\"We asked Israel's army about the details in this report, including striking allegations by Gaza's forensic team that Israel had removed single fingers and toes from the bodies for DNA testing.Israel's military said \"all bodies returned so far are combatants within the Gaza Strip.\"  It denied tying any bodies prior to their release.A spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Shosh Bedrosian, on Wednesday described the reports from Gaza as \"just more efforts to demonise Israel\" and suggested the media focus instead on the experience of Israeli hostages.As families of those missing gather at the hospital gates, Dr Dheir and his staff are under intense pressure to identify the dead and provide answers about what happened to them.So far, only some 50 bodies have been positively identified – mostly through basic details like height, age and obvious previous injuries.  Another 54 have been buried, unidentified and unclaimed, because of intense pressure on space at the unit.Many families of the missing attended the burial of the unnamed dead this week, just in case one of them was theirs.\"Honestly, it's hard to bury a body when you don't know whether it's the right one or not,\" said Rami al-Faraa, still searching for his cousin.\"If there was [DNA] testing, we'd know where he is – yes or no,\" said Houwaida Hamad, searching for her nephew.  \"My sister would know if the one we're burying is really her son or not.\"Donald Trump's ceasefire deal has brought some relief for Gaza, but little closure for the families of most of those missing, left burying a body in place of a brother, husband or son.Correction 24 October 2025: An earlier version of this story said the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages had been returned. This has been amended to a figure of 11 Israeli bodies, as well as that of one Tanzanian and one Thai.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tells the BBC far more aid is needed to start tackling mounting problems in Gaza.Israeli forces have pulled back to a boundary which leaves Israel in control of most of Gaza - keeping far-right ministers on Netanyahu's side, for now.Haimi, killed by Hamas on 7 October 2023, is the 13th out of 28 deceased hostages returned under a ceasefire.One Palestinian family shares their story of life coming full circle - and what they believe lies ahead as talk turns to rebuilding GazaThe Israeli military said it had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" it said had crossed the line demarcating the area occupied by its forces.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term.But Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs.This has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.The video excerpts a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\"When someone says 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal.The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words.The order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address.The original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods.Reagan seeks to use the speech explain why he had introduced the tariffs in this \"special case\" despite his belief that \"imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take\".He makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible \"to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.The advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In a post accompanying the advert, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs.Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.Carney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.Prosecutors said the elaborate plot, which allegedly netted $7m from victims, belonged in a Hollywood film.It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.The ground stop also hit Horizon Air, which is operated by the airline.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.The programme helps 40 million low-income Americans afford groceries - but the government shutdown has funds running dry.Copyright 2025 BBC.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.Belgium held its ground during a summit of European Union leaders, preventing a breakthrough on an audacious plan to issue a €140 billion loan to Ukraine using the immobilised assets of the Russian Central Bank.The bulk of the assets is held at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels.Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever raised the demands in exchange for his blessing, calling for the \"full mutualisation\" of financial risks and the provision of airtight guarantees from all member states. He also urged that Russian sovereign assets held in other European jurisdictions be added to the common pot.\"Who is going to give those guarantees? Is it the member states?\" he said after the summit concluded. \"Because the European Commission cannot oblige the member states to sign a guarantee.\"The main concern for the Belgian prime minister is Russian retaliation if Moscow demands its assets back and sanctions are undone.\"If you take the money from my country, if it goes wrong, I am not able, and certainly not willing, in a week's time to pay €140 billion,\" he said.\"So I would imagine that everybody who is really for this decision, really wants to make this happen, is also ready, willing and able to make a guarantee so that I can sleep quietly at night knowing that if it goes wrong or sour that the solidarity will make (sure) that the money is actually there,\" he added.\"This question was not answered with a tsunami of enthusiasm around the table.\"After intense discussions and negotiations that stretched over the entire day, leaders failed to placate De Wever's concerns and obtain his sought-after blessing. Hungary, meanwhile, outright rejected the initiative, though this was expected.The resistance played against the majority in the room, who see the Russian assets as the only avenue to avoid paying for the assistance out of pocket.Ultimately, heads of state and government settled on considerably weaker language instructing the Commission to present \"as soon as possible\" a list of \"options\" to plug Kyiv's financial and military needs for 2026 and 2027. An earlier version of the conclusions spoke of drafting \"concrete proposals\".Ursula von der Leyen embraced the vague wording as a mandate.\"This is certainly a topic that is not trivial; it's very complex,\" the Commission president said in reply to a question from Euronews.\"There are points to be clarified and have a deep dive,\" she added. \"So in other words, we agreed on the what, that is, the Reparations Loan, and we have to work on the how, how we make it possible (and) what's the best option to move forward.\"Under the tentative scheme, Euroclear would transfer the cash balances generated by the Russian assets to the Commission. The Commission would then use the money to issue a €140 billion loan to Ukraine, disbursed gradually and subject to conditions.Ukraine would be asked to repay the loan only after Russia agrees to compensate for the damages caused. Hence, the name \"Reparations Loan\". Afterwards, the Commission would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay Russia, completing the circle.The plan is still in early stages and needs to be turned into a fully-fledged proposal.António Costa, the president of the European Council, said nobody had \"vetoed anything\" on Thursday and instead \"all the technical issues\" were possible to solve.According to Costa and von der Leyen, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who took part in the summit, said the plan was feasible. Lagarde had previously criticised any plan that would resemble a confiscation of sovereing assets.Costa expressed his hope that a \"final decision\" would be taken at the next summit in December, a view shared by France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz.\"I would use the same argument (as Belgium) if the assets were in Germany. Today we took a step forward that should not be taken for granted,\" Merz said.\"We will do what we can to move forward. I am sure all member states will sign up, but we need to further discuss liability.\"In his remarks, De Wever painted a more nuanced picture of the exchange.\"My impression is that many heads of government are a bit torn between their willingness to support Ukraine (...) and [the fact] they have to acknowledge that these questions are real, that the risks are real and the guarantees need to be there,\" he said.De Wever insisted that a condition for the loan would be to bring other G7 allies on board. The UK and Canada have already expressed their interest in joining. Japan, which also holds Russian sovereign assets, has kept a low profile.\"It would be good not to do it alone,\" De Wever said.Thursday's lukewarm outcome increases the pressure on Europeans to construct a reliable and predictable source of funding for Kyiv.Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a plea to have the loan approved by next year. The country is running low on funds after the US administration of Donald Trump cut off the assistance, further deepening the hole.\"Money we need it in 2026 and better to have it at (the) very beginning of the year,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's possible; not everything depends on us.\"\"We understand who can block, and we can work with these people,\" he said, seemingly referring to Belgium.Browse today's tags"},{"headline":"Trump says trade talks with Canada 'terminated' over anti-tariffs advert","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjrlmd4pmeo","message":"","news":"US President Donald Trump has announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.The advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".Trump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".His administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.

And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal.The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words.The order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address.The original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods.Reagan seeks to use the speech explain why he had introduced the tariffs in this \"special case\" despite his belief that \"imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take\".He makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible \"to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.The advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In a post accompanying the advert, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs.Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.Carney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.Prosecutors said the elaborate plot, which allegedly netted $7m from victims, belonged in a Hollywood film.It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.The ground stop also hit Horizon Air, which is operated by the airline.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.The programme helps 40 million low-income Americans afford groceries - but the government shutdown has funds running dry.Copyright 2025 BBC.

The world should respect EU sanctions the same way it respects US sanctions,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to the new sanctions package announced by the White House on Wednesday evening targeting Russia's two largest oil companies.\"This is important work, so let's get it done: create strong sanctions control and real consequences for those who break the rules.\"With the White House still weighing whether to supply long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, Zelenskyy said \"These long-range weapons are not only in the US.\"\"Some European countries also have them, including Tomahawks. We are already talking to the countries that can help.\"He reiterated that Kyiv needs the missiles to defend from Russia's intensified bombardments.\"We need to defend and respond if we don’t want to give them the possibility to attack and to win,\" he said.Earlier this week Zelenskyy said Ukraine is preparing a long-term contract for 25 Patriot batteries. This is the only Western-made air defence system capable of consistently shooting down Russian ballistic missiles.But the Patriot system is in high demand, with a years-long waiting list both for the batteries themselves and for the interceptor missiles.Zelenskyy said Kyiv is asking its allies to help prioritise his country's defence.\"Some countries already have Patriot systems, but luckily they don't need to use them like we do. We suggest changing the order. If we get the systems now, we're ready to give them back or replace them when it’s our turn.\"Reinforced air defence and more long-range weapons supplies is what Kyiv believes will ultimately force Russia to the negotiating table.\"When we talk about long-range weapons for Ukraine, we mean that the Putin regime should feel real consequences from this war,\" Zelenskyy told EU leaders, urging them to \"to support everything that helps Ukraine get such capabilities, because it really makes a difference for Russia.\"\"Just look at how nervous Putin became when this topic came up. He understands that long-range weapons can truly change the course of the war.\"He did not rule out the possibility of Ukraine still getting US-made Tomahawk missiles.\"We don't have Tomahawks yet. We will see, every day brings something. Maybe tomorrow we will have Tomahawks,\" he suggested.From Brussels, Ukraine's president will travel to London for a meeting of the \"Coalition of the Willing,\" which Kyiv hopes will focus on energy and weapons supplies to Ukraine.Browse today's tags"},{"headline":"Zelensky meeting King in Windsor ahead of talks with European leaders","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cnve57vlrlnt","message":"","news":"President Zelensky Meets King at Windsor CastleBBC NewsPresident Zelensky Meets King at Windsor CastleBBC NewsVolodymyr Zelensky is meeting King Charles in Windsor - it's the third time they've met this yearThe Ukrainian leader will then head to London where he'll join UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at No 10 for a gathering of the so-called coalition of the willingStarmer's expected to push European leaders to provide Ukraine with more long-range missiles, after a successful attack on a Russian chemical plant using British-supplied Storm Shadow missilesIt comes after US President Donald Trump applied fresh sanctions against two of Russia's largest oil companies, in an effort to pressure Moscow into negotiationsTrump - who has refused to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles - also shelved a meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin, saying: \"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere\"Edited by Rorey BosottiA view of Downing Street this morning shows the stage is set for Volodymyr Zelensky's arrival in London for a meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing.The Ukrainian president will meet UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer along with other allies and is expected to discuss ways to put more pressure on Russia.Stay with us as we'll bring you all the latest as the day unfolds.Some pictures are now coming in to us from Windsor, where Zelensky is with King Charles.He can be seen inspecting the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, ahead of a meeting with the King inside the castle.As we've mentioned in the post below, this is the third time President Zelensky and King Charles meet this year.In March, Zelensky met the King at Sandringham after attending a summit of European leaders focused on ending the war in Ukraine. Royal sources said the meeting was just over an hour and President Zelensky was \"warmly received\" by the monarch.Then, in June, the King hosted Zelensky at Windsor Castle.King Charles has previously expressed support for Zelensky and Ukraine, saying the country had experienced \"indescribable aggression\" following Russia's \"unprovoked attack on their land\".As we wait for fresh pictures to come in from Windsor Castle, here's a look at the pair's earlier meetings:Ukraine's President Zelensky is in Windsor now to meet King Charles. This is their third meeting this year.Arriving at Windsor Castle, he was given a royal salute and the Ukrainian national anthem was played.We'll bring you some pictures of this when we get them.Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin last met in August during a hastily arranged summit in AlaskaZelensky's talks with Ukraine's European allies come as a face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin was put on hold on Tuesday.Plans for Trump-Putin talks in Budapest were first announced by Trump a week ago, after what he called a \"good and productive\" phone call between the pair that lasted over two hours.But after a call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, a White House official said there are \"no plans\" for Trump to meet Putin \"in the immediate future\".Speaking to reporters later that day, the US president said he didn't want a \"wasted meeting\".Trump has also voiced his frustration at his meetings with the Kremlin leader, saying: \"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere\".Going into today's meeting, Zelensky is still without the Tomahawk missiles he's been seeking - the main focus of his visit to the White House last week.Tomahawk missiles have a range of up to 2,500km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach of Ukraine. Zelensky believes using them to strike Russian oil and energy facilities would seriously weaken Putin's war economy.Although Trump had previously said he was considering giving Ukraine the long-range missiles, Zelensky left the bilateral talks last Friday empty-handed.The Ukrainian president said after the meeting that he had discussed the weapons with Trump, but chose not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".On Wednesday,  the US announced that it was sanctioning Russia's two largest oil companies, aiming to put more economic pressure on Russia to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine.This marks a clear shift in foreign policy from US President Donald Trump, who had previously said he would not impose more sanctions unless European countries stopped buying Russian oil and gas - Russia's biggest export.\"I just felt it was time,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the sanctions.The UK has also recently sanctioned the same two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. EU countries have issued new sanctions banning the import of Russian liquefied natural gas from January 2027.Ahead of today's summit, EU leaders stopped short of releasing billions of euros in frozen Russian cash to help fund Ukraine's defence.They made the move during a meeting in Brussels on Thursday.The decision to use €140bn (£122bn) in Russian assets was pushed back until December, but leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years.The final text asks the European Commission for \"options for financial support based on an assessment of Ukraine's financing needs\".\"Russia's assets should remain immobilised until Russia ceases its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates it for the damage caused by its war,\" the declaration adds.Zelensky, who was in Brussels for the summit, welcomed the outcome as a signal of \"political support\" for the notion of using Russian assets to keep Kyiv in the fight.\"We must ratchet up the pressure on Russia and build on President Trump's decisive action,\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said ahead of the coalition of the willing meeting today.\"The only person involved in this conflict who does not want to stop the war is President Putin,\" he says.\"Time and again\" Putin has been offered a chance to stop the war \"but he repeatedly rejects those proposals and any chance of peace\", Starmer adds.\"Ukraine's security matters to us all, and what happens on the front line of Donetsk today is shaping our collective future for years to come.\"\"I don't put much hope into the coalition of the willing\" says Alexander Khara, former adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Defence.But he says that talking about practicalities, including long-range missiles for Ukraine, \"certainly, is a good thing\" - adding that the weapons are \"something that we badly need to degrade Russia's fighting capabilities\".Khara gives Crimea as an example of where he thinks these missiles would be useful: it's \"a centre of gravity in this war and we cannot liberate it with ground forces\".The former adviser believes targeting Crimea with long-range missiles is \"something that may bring Putin to the negotiating table\".Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to urge fellow coalition of the willing countries to provide Ukraine with more long-range missiles after a successful attack on Russia earlier this week.The prime minister is set to announce the delivery of an extra 140 air defence missiles to Ukraine this winter, as part of an increase in the UK missile-building programme.This announcement is part of a £1.6bn deal signed between UK industry and Ukraine in March.On Wednesday, Ukraine used UK-supplied long-range weapons - called Storm Shadow missiles - to strike a Russian chemical plant in Bryansk, Russia.Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces called it a \"successful hit\" that penetrated the Russian air defence system.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer co-chaired a virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting in August to offer Ukraine supportThe coalition of the willing was formed by the leaders of the UK and France in March. It now includes about 30 countries.The group's focus is Ukraine's security. It last met in August - virtually - to discuss the \"reassurance force\" that would go in to Ukraine if hostilities end, aiming to deter future Russian aggression.While the group has pledged to protect peace in Ukraine once it is achieved, there is a range of views on how best to do this.Countries like the UK have said they would be ready to provide troops to secure Ukraine's border in the event of a ceasefire.Other members have not promised a military presence on the ground, but have offered arms and logistical support.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is in London today for a meeting of the coalition of the willing - a group of countries that have pledged to protect peace in Ukraine if a ceasefire agreement is reached.Alongside Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof - with France's President Emmanuel Macron joining virtually.The leaders are expected to discuss ways to increase pressure on Moscow through sanctions, as well as strengthening Ukraine's defences using frozen Russian assets.Following an attack on a Russian chemical plant using British-supplied weapons this week, an increase in the provision of long-range weapons for Ukraine is also being considered.We'll be following this closely and bringing you all the key moments as they happen throughout the day.Stay with us.Copyright © 2025 BBC.

Whether it was intentional or not, it is unacceptable. The allies have expressed full solidarity with Poland. It is crucial to counter aggression and defend every member of the Alliance,\" the NATO chief said.Meanwhile on 23 September, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Russian involvement could not be ruled out after Copenhagen airport was forced to close for several hours the previous night following the sighting of a number of drones.\"It says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with,\" Frederiksen said.The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the allegations \"unfounded.\"Also on 22 September, Oslo airport in Norway was closed for three hours after possible drone sightings were reported.Russia allegedly violated Norway's airspace three times in 2025, according to the government, but it remains unclear whether Monday's incident was deliberate or the result of navigation errors.\"Regardless of the cause, this is not acceptable,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said.Browse today's tags"},{"headline":"A bishop’s secret church trial and the U.S. Anglican Church in turmoil","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/10/24/anglican-church-bishop-allegations/","message":"","news":"A child sex offender, a man accused of attempted second-degree murder, a man who solicited a prostitute — all were allowed to lead or worship in Stewart Ruch’s diocese.During a sunlit service in May, the interim head pastor of the Church of the Resurrection in suburban Chicago stepped to the lectern.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians filled the streets of Budapest on Thursday in competing demonstrations, as supporters of the country’s two main political movements staged mutual shows of strength before next spring’s national election.With elections due in April, the rival rallies were a standoff between conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his main political challenger, Péter Magyar, who looks set to present the long-serving Hungarian leader with the most competitive ballot in his 15 years in power.Orbán’s supporters gathered on a bridge spanning the Danube River on Thursday morning and began marching toward Budapest's landmark neo-Gothic parliament.Dubbed a “peace march” by organisers, the rally took place on Revolution Memorial Day, a national holiday in memory of a failed anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 that was crushed by the Red Army.The event, however, largely focused on criticising EU policy on Ukraine as well as the country's main opposition party, Tisza.Participants shouted slogans backing Orbán and his message that foreign powers threaten to push Hungary into direct involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the front of the march, one large banner read, “We don’t want to die for Ukraine”.Addressing the crowd in a speech riddled with hostility for both Ukraine and the European Union — regular subjects of his ire — Orbán accused Kyiv’s European backers of having brought the EU into the war and of being willing “to send others to die”.Orbán has consistently argued against Western support for neighbouring Ukraine since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022, and has maintained friendly relations with the Kremlin while criticising Kyiv.The Hungarian leader has also vehemently opposed Ukraine’s ambitions to join the EU and has argued for an immediate ceasefire in the war. However, he has not addressed what that might imply for Ukraine’s territorial integrity or European security amid continued Russian aggression.During his roughly 40-minute speech, Orbán said that Ukraine “has long ceased to be sovereign and independent and is absolutely not self-sufficient.”He said he would support a strategic partnership between the EU and Kyiv, but that Ukraine “cannot be members either of our military or economic alliance. They would bring war, take our money, and ruin our economy.”Later in the day, throngs of supporters of opposition leader Magyar filled one of Budapest’s central squares and adjacent avenues for their own demonstration — both an anti-government protest and a show of support for Magyar and his conservative Tisza party.The march organised by Tisza featured performances and photo exhibitions commemorating the failed anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. Marchers shouted anti-government slogans as well as “Russians go home” — a refrain from the 1956 rebellion and a modern reference to many people’s view that Orbán has drawn the country too close to Moscow.One Tisza supporter, Zsanett Kiss, travelled from Pápa in western Hungary to attend the march. She said she believed Magyar would be able to improve Hungary’s stagnant economy and also bring the country back to a more liberal path.“I want there to be a change already in this country, and I can say that I’ve had enough, enough of the last 15 years,” she said.Speaking to the crowd of his supporters that filled Budapest’s sprawling Heroes’ Square, Magyar accused Orbán of impoverishing the country by misusing public funds and turning Hungarians against one another.The 44-year-old lawyer and former insider within Orbán’s Fidesz party burst into political prominence last year.Since then, he has focused his message on bread-and-butter issues affecting the majority of Hungarians: persistent inflation, poor health care, and increasingly salient allegations of government corruption — all sources of dissatisfaction that have plagued Orbán’s government.The rural countryside, which has always been a dependable vote base for Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party, has been the focus of Magyar's campaign.He recently concluded an 80-day national tour during which he spoke at numerous town hall-style meetings and fielded audience questions.But this time around, he is adopting an inclusive stance, urging his followers to accept their political rivals after the April 2026 election. An exact date for the vote is yet to be set.Browse today's tags"},{"headline":"A child sex offender, a man accused of attempted second-degree murder, a man who solicited a prostitute — all were allowed to lead or worship in Stewart Ruch’s diocese.","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/10/24/anglican-church-bishop-allegations/","message":"","news":"A child sex offender, a man accused of attempted second-degree murder, a man who solicited a prostitute — all were allowed to lead or worship in Stewart Ruch’s diocese.During a sunlit service in May, the interim head pastor of the Church of the Resurrection in suburban Chicago stepped to the lectern.

Both men deny the allegations.Rozier, 31, is among six people arrested over alleged betting irregularities. They include NBA players accused of faking injuries to influence gambling markets.Billups, a Hall of Fame player turned coach, is one of 31 people charged in a separate illegal poker game case involving retired players and the mafia.That case, which prosecutors said involved four of the five major crime families in New York, uncovered an alleged scheme to lure victims into playing rigged poker games alongside high-profile sports stars before stealing millions of dollars.They did so using technology including special contact lenses and glasses that could read pre-marked cards and an X-ray table, according to authorities.The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being placed on immediate leave as it reviews the federal indictments.\"We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority,\" it said.Rozier's lawyer denied the allegations to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, saying: \"Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\"He appeared in federal court in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday and was released on bail after he put up his Florida home – valued at $6m (£4.5m) – as collateral, according to local media.Billups, who has coached the Portland Trail Blazers since 2021, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and arraigned in court on Thursday, according to local media. He is expected to prepare a substantial bond for his release, too.His lawyer Chris Heywood also denied the accusations, telling CBS in a statement: \"He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"FBI Director Kash Patel held a news conference with other prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday where he announced the two indictments.He called the arrests \"extraordinary\" and said there was a \"co-ordinated takedown across 11 states\".\"We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud and theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation,\" he said.US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Joseph Nocella Jr, said all defendants were innocent until proven guilty, but warned: \"Your winning streak has ended. Your luck has run out.\"Prosecutors said the first case involved players and associates who allegedly used  information not available to the public to manipulate bets on major gambling platforms.Nocella called it \"one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes since online sports betting became widely legalised\".Seven NBA games between February 2023 and March 2024 have been identified as part of the case. Rozier is said to have been involved in one between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, when he was playing for the Hornets.Rozier is alleged to have told a friend that he would leave the game early due to injury. The friend and his associates then placed bets, or directed others to bet, \"more than $200,000\" that Rozier would underperform expectations in the game, prosecutors said.He left the game after nine minutes, they said, which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in betting profits for those involved.During the game, Rozier scored just five points before going off because of a sore right foot, according to the official NBA match report.Before that game, he averaged 35 minutes of playing time and about 21 points per game.\"As the NBA season tips off, his career is already benched, not for injury but for integrity,\" New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.Rozier's lawyer James Trusty said in a statement that prosecutors \"appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case\".Mr Trusty said he had been representing Rozier for more than a year and said prosecutors characterised Rozier as a subject, not a target, until they informed him FBI agents were arresting the player at a hotel on Thursday morning.Former NBA player Damon Jones was also arrested as part of the investigation.Jones is said to have been involved in two of the identified games - when the Los Angeles Lakers met the Milwaukee Bucks in February 2023, and a January 2024 game between the Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder.Sports betting was outlawed in most of the US from 1992 until 2018, when the Supreme Court turned regulation of the practice over to the states.Since the federal ban was struck down, sports betting has exploded with major sports leagues and media companies making deals with gambling firms to get in on the billion-dollar industry.The second indictment announced on Thursday involves 31 defendants alleged to have participated in a scheme to rig illegal poker games and steal millions of dollars.The case involved 13 members and associates of the Bonanno, Genovese and Gambino crime families in New York.Nocella said the targeted victims were lured to play games with former professional athletes, including Billups and Jones, in Las Vegas, Miami, Manhattan and the Hamptons.Victims were \"fleeced\" out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game, he said.He said defendants used \"very sophisticated technology\" like altered off-the-shelf shuffling machines that could read the cards. Some of the defendants used special contact lenses and glasses to read marked cards, and an X-ray table that could read cards when they were face-down.\"What [the victims] didn't know is that everybody else at the poker game - from the dealer to the players were in on the scam,\" Nocella said.Tisch said that, when people refused to pay, the organised crime families used threats and intimidation to get them to hand over the money.The charges include robbery, extortion, wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal gambling.The conspiracy cheated victims out of $7m, with one losing $1.8 million, officials said.\"This is only the tip of the iceberg,\" Christopher Raia, the FBI assistant director of the New York field office, said, adding that the FBI was working hard to ensure members of mafia families \"cannot continue to wreak havoc in our communities\".It now involves itself in securities fraud, gambling and online sports betting, prosecutors say.UK's ad watchdog warns the betting companies not to include any character who has a strong appeal to viewers under the age of 18.The company's co-founder says it would be forced to close all its sites, putting 7,500 jobs at risk, if gambling taxes go up.Billionaire JB Pritzker won the sum while on holiday with friends and family.Its parent company said affected staff would be \"offered redeployment opportunities where possible\".Copyright 2025 BBC.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.German family-run business Böcker, based in North Rhine-Westphalia, became an accidental accomplice in the weekend's highest-profile Louvre Museum heist — after one of its mechanical lifts played a key role in the audacious heist.On Sunday, perpetrators parked a truck with a lifting platform at the Louvre, used it to climb onto a terrace, and from there forced their way into the interior of the building and stole crown jewels worth €88 million in the space of seven minutes.And just one day after the robbery, Böcker decided to react with a post loaded with sharp humour, turning the theft into marketing gold, after learning that nobody was hurt during the heist. The post features its now-infamous furniture ladder stretched up to a balcony outside the Apollo Gallery.The company's management superimposed the slogan over a crime scene photo. “When you need to move fast,” the caption reads, \"the Böcker Agilo transports your treasures weighing up to 400kg at 42m/min — quiet as a whisper.\"A post shared by Böcker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)Speaking to AFP, managing director Alexander Böcker said they decided to add “a touch of humour” to the situation. \"The crime is, of course, absolutely reprehensible, that's completely clear to us,\" Mr Böcker said.\"It was... an opportunity for us to use the most famous and most visited museum in the world to get a little attention for our company.\"Online reaction to the cheeky ad has been positive, with comments ranging from \"This might be the best ad I've seen this year!\" to \"brilliant marketing move\".\"Your messaging takes the crown,\" one user joked.Böcker confirmed the lift was sold years ago to a French rental firm, from whom the thieves allegedly “borrowed” it after arranging a fake demonstration last week.Adding to the online buzz around the heist, fresh footage of the incident has surfaced on social media, showing the culprits’ unhurried escape.The 36-second clip, filmed from a nearby window overlooking the Quai François Mitterrand, shows two men in black — one in a hi-vis vest, the other in a motorcycle helmet — descending on the Böcker ladder from the museum’s Apollo Gallery.The robbery, which took place at around 9:30 CEST on Sunday, lasted between six and seven minutes and involved four people who were unarmed, but threatened guards with angle grinders, according to Paris prosecutor Laura Beccuau.Officials said nine pieces were targeted, but eight were stolen, from the Napoleon and the Empress' jewellery collection in the Apollo Gallery, including a necklace, a brooch, a tiara and more.One object was later found outside the museum, Dati said. French media identified it as the emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds. It was reportedly recovered broken.French President Emmanuel Macron reacted to the robbery on X. He wrote: \"The theft committed at the Louvre is an attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our History. We will recover the works, and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.\"Browse today's tags"},{"headline":"Palestinian teen killed in Israeli raid on West Bank as settlers rampage","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/palestinian-child-killed-in-israeli-raid-on-west-bank-as-settlers-rampage","message":"","news":"Israeli forces kill youth in Nablus, in the occupied territory, as settlers destroy property near Ramallah.By Al Jazeera StaffShareSaveA Palestinian teenager has died of wounds sustained during an Israeli military raid in the Askar camp in Nablus, in the latest violence against civilians in the occupied West Bank, as a fragile ceasefire in Gaza brings little respite to Palestinians in the destroyed enclave.Eighteen-year-old Mohammed Ahmed Abu Haneen died on Friday from wounds sustained during the Israeli raid, the Wafa news agency reported.Israeli forces also stormed the town of Aqaba, north of Tubas in the West Bank, and made a number of arrests earlier today in Hebron and Tal.The Israeli army said they arrested 44 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank over the past week. A military statement says operations were carried out in various parts of the territory and all people detained were wanted by Israel. It added that troops also confiscated weapons and conducted interrogations during the operations.Last week, 10-year-old Mohammad al-Hallaq was shot dead by Israeli forces while playing football in ar-Rihiya, Hebron.According to the United Nations, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army and settlers since October 7, 2023, in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem.A fifth of the victims are children, including 206 boys and seven girls, the UN said. The number also includes 20 women and at least seven people with disabilities. This does not include Palestinians who died in Israeli detention during the same period, the UN added.A United States-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal has seen nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees released from Israeli jails, many bearing visible signs of abuse.Dozens of Palestinian bodies returned have been badly mutilated and show signs of torture and execution.Meanwhile, in tandem with the military’s sustained crackdown in the occupied territory, Israeli settlers have rampaged near Ramallah, destroying Palestinian property at an alarming rate daily with impunity, protected by the military.Settlers set fire to several Palestinian vehicles in the hill area in Deir Dibwan, east of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, at dawn this morning, Wafa reported. Settlers also attacked Palestinian farmers while they were harvesting olives in the lands of the village of Beit Iksa, northwest of JerusalemOn Sunday, an Israeli settler brutally assaulted a Palestinian woman while she was harvesting olives in the West Bank town of Turmus Aya.Afaf Abu Alia, 53, suffered a brain haemorrhage due to the attack.“The attack started with around 10 settlers, but more kept joining,” one Palestinian witness told Al Jazeera. “I think by the end, there were 40, protected by the army. We were outnumbered; we couldn’t defend ourselves.”According to data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), settlers have attacked Palestinians nearly 3,000 times in the occupied West Bank over the past two years.UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said on Friday that since October 7, 2023, “the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has also witnessed a sharp escalation in violence”.“The increasing annexation of the West Bank is happening steadily in a gross violation of international law,” UNRWA said, referring to the expansion and recognition of illegal Israeli settlements.After a vote in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday advancing a bill that would formalise the annexation of the occupied West Bank, senior US officials have been adamant it won’t happen under their watch.US President Donald Trump said on Thursday, “Israel is not going to do anything with the West Bank” amid growing condemnation of an Israeli parliamentary motion that seeks to formally annex the occupied Palestinian territory.Earlier in the day, in an interview with Time Magazine, Trump said that the US is firmly against Israeli annexation. “It won’t happen. It won’t happen. It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. And you can’t do that now,” Trump told Time.US Vice President JD Vance, meanwhile, while in Israel, also said that Trump’s policy remains that the occupied West Bank won’t be annexed by Israel, calling the parliamentary vote in favour of annexation a “very stupid political stunt” that he “personally” took some insult from.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in Israel to shore up the Gaza ceasefire and second-phase plans, has also lined up in the Trump’s administration’s firm opposition to Israeli annexation.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"AnalysisAnalysisTrump’s sanctions target Russian ‘war ATM,’ but the real test is enforcement","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/business/analysis-trump-sanctions-russian-war-machine-latam-intl","message":"","news":"MarketsHot StocksFear & Greed IndexLatest Market NewsHot StocksAfter nine months of attempting to coax Russia into concessions using only incentives – whether by holding talks on repairing diplomatic relations or hosting a major bilateral summit on US soil – the Trump administration in an unexpected reversal announced “massive sanctions” Wednesday on Moscow’s two biggest oil producers.Just one week earlier, President Donald Trump had backed away from supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine after a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who secured an invitation to a second bilateral summit, this time in Budapest.Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among the more hawkish members of Trump’s Cabinet regarding Ukraine, was tasked with preparing that summit. But Russia’s uncompromising insistence on addressing what it sees as the “root causes” of the conflict finally hit home at the White House. Trump didn’t want to “waste time” at another summit, he said Wednesday, though he left the door open, suggesting that “we’ll do it in the future.”Trump’s frustration with Russia had clearly been growing in recent months, as it became clear that his much-touted Alaska summit had failed to stop escalating violence in Ukraine. He even shifted his position on Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia, increasing intelligence sharing to help Kyiv target military and energy facilities, sources told CNN last week.And yet after multiple threats from Trump to ramp up sanctions against Moscow failed to materialize, and with the call between the two presidents last week suggesting the US leader was still susceptible to Russian persuasion, Wednesday’s move to sanction the Russian oil giants and their subsidiaries blindsided experts.“It was actually surprising simply because there was always a discrepancy between Trump’s rhetoric and actions,” said Maria Shagina, a senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), in written comments to CNN.“It seems that today Russia has overplayed its hand, and Trump’s patience is wearing thin,” she wrote.How painful this will be for Russia is something that experts and energy markets are still trying to decipher.This is the first time Trump has imposed direct sanctions on Russia since he returned to office in January, though in August, his administration declared punishing secondary tariffs on India for its purchases of Russian oil.The sanctions are typical in the sense that the companies listed – Rosneft and Lukoil, along with dozens of subsidiaries – will have their assets frozen in the United States, and US entities will be banned from doing business with them. Yet most experts agree that targeting Rosneft and Lukoil represents a significant change. Together, the two companies account for about half of Russian oil exports, according to RBC Capital Markets.In January, the Biden administration went after Russia’s third- and fourth-largest oil companies, Gazpromneft and Surgutneftegaz, in its final package of sanctions. But it left the biggest ones alone, experts say, over fears of triggering global supply disruptions that would lead to higher oil prices.In a note Wednesday night, Helima Croft, head of Commodities Strategy at RBC, called Trump’s sanctions “the most material move to date by the United States to shutter the Russian war ATM.”Another first for Trump’s second term here is the appearance (whether by accident or design) of coordinating sanctions with NATO allies, which had been normal practice under the Biden administration.A week earlier, on October 15, the United Kingdom expanded its sanctions to include Rosneft and Lukoil, and on Wednesday, the European Union also unanimously approved its 19th package of sanctions. That package includes a full transaction ban on Rosneft. And while it stops short of targeting Lukoil, it goes after Litasco, a trading unit of Lukoil in the United Arab Emirates that the European Union describes as “Lukoil’s prominent shadow fleet enabler.”“This is a clear signal from both sides of the Atlantic that we will keep up collective pressure on the aggressor,” wrote European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who also held a call Wednesday with the US treasury secretary.The impact that the new US sanctions could have on the Russian economy is up for debate. Shagina, the IISS senior fellow, points out that the move comes at a “vulnerable point” for Moscow, which faces the double whammy of Western sanctions and what she calls Ukrainian “physical sanctions” with its ongoing drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. Those attacks have already contributed to a 20% drop in Russia’s energy revenues so far this year, though Moscow is planning to make up some of the shortfall through tax increases.“It’s a strong signal, but it’s still more of a signal than a huge blow to the Russian economy,” said Janis Kluge of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank in Berlin. He points out there has been little to no effect so far on the ruble and that the stocks of Lukoil and Rosneft have fallen but “not cratered.”Experts largely expect that while there may be temporary supply disruptions, Russia will find ways to keep its oil – including that produced by Lukoil and Rosneft – flowing onto global markets.“Russia has set up a total off-grid infrastructure to be able to keep on supplying its oil to its trading partners, especially in India, especially in China,” said Ajay Parmar, director of oil markets and energy transition at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), a London-based commodities data and analytics firm. He said he believes that the Russians will simply make “adjustments” and create new workarounds.The lasting impact will depend on the US appetite to tackle those workarounds as they arise, said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitical analysis at Energy Aspects, a data and intelligence firm in London“It’s not clear yet that the Trump administration, even if it doesn’t get what it wants from Putin, is going to have the resolve and the desire to go down that road,” he told CNN.The US has imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies in a bid to push Moscow toward an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. CNN's Clare Sebastian weighs in how much impact the move could have.The big question for both Russia and the global economy, experts say, is how India will respond to these new US sanctions. Citing industry sources, Reuters reported Thursday that Reliance Industries, India’s biggest importer of Russian crude oil, is planning to cut back or stop imports completely, going even further than the letter of the sanctions as US pressure mounts on New Delhi to stop importing Russian oil as a condition for tariff reduction.As US gets tough on Moscow, has Putin’s strategy of playing Trump run its course?For Russia, this would be critical.  India imports 1.5 million to 2 million barrels of Russian crude per day, Parmar estimates, accounting for about 30-40% of all Russian exports.  If those imports were to suddenly stop, “that would leave only China as the big buyer of Russian oil,” he told CNN. “I think it’s unlikely that China would buy all of that lost oil, so some of it may be taken off the market, and that is really the bigger driver for higher oil prices right now,” he added.US crude oil prices are down almost 25 percent from their peak in January, a drop that gave Trump “more room now to impose sanctions,” Kluge pointed out. But the challenge will be avoiding sustained price rises that could hand an unexpected windfall to Moscow and partially offset the impact of sanctions, he said. That would likely mean Trump putting further pressure on OPEC+ to boost oil production, said Parmar. If Trump is successful, price rises could be contained.On their own, these sanctions are nowhere near enough to spark a course correction in Moscow, experts agree. And yet they could signal more difficult times ahead for the Kremlin.The response from Putin, coming almost 24 hours after the US sanctions announcement, was somewhat contradictory.The sanctions “will not significantly affect our economic well-being,” he told a group of Russian reporters. “No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever make decisions under pressure,” he added.The ultimate economic impact of these new sanctions on Russia is yet to be determined but the political shift is alarming for Moscow, said Kluge, of the German think tank.“Yes, it could be different tomorrow again,” he said referring to Trump’s approach to Russia.But “it’s a signal that the previous mode of dealing with Russia in which there was always another chance … another extension to the ultimatum … has actually ended.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

A military statement says operations were carried out in various parts of the territory and all people detained were wanted by Israel. It added that troops also confiscated weapons and conducted interrogations during the operations.Last week, 10-year-old Mohammad al-Hallaq was shot dead by Israeli forces while playing football in ar-Rihiya, Hebron.According to the United Nations, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army and settlers since October 7, 2023, in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem.A fifth of the victims are children, including 206 boys and seven girls, the UN said. The number also includes 20 women and at least seven people with disabilities. This does not include Palestinians who died in Israeli detention during the same period, the UN added.A United States-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal has seen nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees released from Israeli jails, many bearing visible signs of abuse.Dozens of Palestinian bodies returned have been badly mutilated and show signs of torture and execution.Meanwhile, in tandem with the military’s sustained crackdown in the occupied territory, Israeli settlers have rampaged near Ramallah, destroying Palestinian property at an alarming rate daily with impunity, protected by the military.Settlers set fire to several Palestinian vehicles in the hill area in Deir Dibwan, east of the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, at dawn this morning, Wafa reported. Settlers also attacked Palestinian farmers while they were harvesting olives in the lands of the village of Beit Iksa, northwest of JerusalemOn Sunday, an Israeli settler brutally assaulted a Palestinian woman while she was harvesting olives in the West Bank town of Turmus Aya.Afaf Abu Alia, 53, suffered a brain haemorrhage due to the attack.“The attack started with around 10 settlers, but more kept joining,” one Palestinian witness told Al Jazeera. “I think by the end, there were 40, protected by the army. We were outnumbered; we couldn’t defend ourselves.”According to data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), settlers have attacked Palestinians nearly 3,000 times in the occupied West Bank over the past two years.UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said on Friday that since October 7, 2023, “the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has also witnessed a sharp escalation in violence”.“The increasing annexation of the West Bank is happening steadily in a gross violation of international law,” UNRWA said, referring to the expansion and recognition of illegal Israeli settlements.After a vote in the Israeli parliament on Wednesday advancing a bill that would formalise the annexation of the occupied West Bank, senior US officials have been adamant it won’t happen under their watch.US President Donald Trump said on Thursday, “Israel is not going to do anything with the West Bank” amid growing condemnation of an Israeli parliamentary motion that seeks to formally annex the occupied Palestinian territory.Earlier in the day, in an interview with Time Magazine, Trump said that the US is firmly against Israeli annexation. “It won’t happen. It won’t happen. It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. And you can’t do that now,” Trump told Time.US Vice President JD Vance, meanwhile, while in Israel, also said that Trump’s policy remains that the occupied West Bank won’t be annexed by Israel, calling the parliamentary vote in favour of annexation a “very stupid political stunt” that he “personally” took some insult from.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in Israel to shore up the Gaza ceasefire and second-phase plans, has also lined up in the Trump’s administration’s firm opposition to Israeli annexation.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Three things we learned from China's big political meeting this week","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wv8q5evvqo","message":"","news":"A four-day meeting of hundreds of Chinese Communist Party (CPC) delegates, chaired by General Secretary Xi Jinping concluded on Thursday, with the release of a communique.The broad document highlights major points in the next five-year plan for China's economic development.Here are three of the main things we have learned from the meeting and what the communique says:China watchers have been looking at the official numbers regarding attendance this week.You would need a pretty good excuse not to turn up to a Plenum session chaired by Xi. For example, very serious illness.And yet, of the 205 members of the Central Committee, only 168 were there.We know that one has died and 10 have already been purged.That leaves 26 missing cadres.Do these missing members mean that more senior Party officials have been taken down in the latest \"anti-corruption\" drive than have been reported?On top of this there are also dozens of missing \"alternate\" delegates. These are non-voting positions for people who can fill missing slots as required.Names of those not in attendance have not been provided, but it is not a small number of missing delegates. This has led to wide speculation that they too have been purged in the latest sweeps from the Party's feared internal discipline inspection teams.In the military alone the numbers are stark.It seems that of the 33 generals who are members of the Central Committee, 22 did not attend the plenum. This might include the eight who have been removed officially but where are the other 14? Who are they and what happened to them?With China's opaque system of governance, sometimes questions like these are never answered.What is clear though is that the Party was clearing the decks in the days leading up to this gathering so such dismissals could be made official, including the expulsion of He Weidong who was number three in the PLA.Political analysts will argue though as to whether this represents strength or weakness on General Secretary Xi's part. Are these the acts of a paranoid leader concerned that power blocks might be forming beyond his control, or the firm hand of a figure prepared to take down those who act improperly irrespective of their rank?Either way, it seems there will be no letting up.At a press conference on Friday, the Director of the Central Policy Research Office, Jiang Jinquan, said the Party would \"maintain an unwavering tenacity with no finish line in the fight against corruption\".When Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet in South Korea next week, they will be discussing the considerable trade frictions between the two superpowers.At the pointy end of this, China wants better access to US computer chips and advanced software and the US wants better access to China's rare earths and magnets. The problem is that both sides are reluctant to provide them because they will assist in boosting the other's economic and political strength.So, Beijing needs other sources for its high-tech requirements, leading naturally to the conclusion: when in doubt develop it yourself.A key objective listed in the communique was the achievement of  \"substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance\".Then – just to make it really clear – the read out from the Communist Party's trusted Xinhua wire service again referred to \"self-reliance\", stating: \"The country should achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology and steer the development of new quality productive forces\".Xi Jinping's catchphrase of \"new quality productive forces\" gets used a lot in Chinese government documents. It encapsulates the drive for homegrown, high-level, technological advances – often with military applications – which are to emerge in partnerships between the private sector, state-owned enterprises and the People's Liberation Army.It is all about more tech, better tech, hopefully without any reliance on the Americans.Another impact of the trade war with the US has been the loss of export markets. This has been a heavy blow to an economy which has been, and remains, heavily reliant on selling goods overseas.Well before the tariff conflict with the Trump administration, academics had been warning China that it needed to rebalance its economy, placing a much greater emphasis on domestic consumption as opposed to exports.The thinking was that it was not sustainable, in the long run, to have such a low proportion of GDP made up by the Chinese people's consumption rates as they stood.Trump's tariff assault on the world has brought this into sharper focus. New charges on the import of Chinese made goods have slowed some of them being sold in the US.While China's exporters have proven to be more resilient than Trump predicted – finding new global buyers to make up for lost American orders – the problem has not gone away.The thinking is that with such geopolitical uncertainty, this is the time for China to turn to its huge domestic population to give its economy a shot in the arm.According to the official readout from this Plenum, it has been determined that the country \"should build a robust domestic market and work faster to foster a new pattern of development\".But how?These five-year-plan documents are usually more of a broad vision for the economy, rather than a specific set of measures. However, many analysts say that nothing has emerged from this meeting to indicate that the government has any fresh ideas to actually drive domestic consumption.In short, how do you get people to save less and spend more when they are worried about the real estate crisis and high youth unemployment?The Party can talk about \"building a robust domestic market\" but it needs solid solutions.It will be the first face-to-face meeting for both leaders since Trump's return to office.Zhang Shengmin heads anti-corruption efforts in the army and is seen as a trusted loyalist of President Xi.China has thrown its weight behind the junta - and its widely condemned plan to hold an election in December.The Chinese company saw strong sales in overseas markets, especially in the US.The two countries will boost investments to expand mining and processing of critical minerals, amid dependency on China.Copyright 2025 BBC.

So I canceled it.”The wholesale reversal was cheered by Trump’s European allies and many of the president’s supporters, and condemned as unhelpful by Putin. After months of threatening new measures on Russia, only to stop short, Trump has now gone further than ever before in punishing the country for its war in Ukraine.“I just felt it was time,” Trump said at the White House moments after the new sanctions were announced. “We waited a long time.”US sanctions Russia’s two largest oil companies and calls on Moscow to agree to immediate ceasefireWhether Trump’s new stance is permanent, or simply a temporary phase, is an open question. He has repeatedly zigzagged in his approach to Putin since returning to office, often influenced by his phone conversations with the Russian leader. And new pressure on global oil prices could test his willingness to withstand the potential fallout for American consumers.There was no single moment that shifted the president’s thinking, according to a senior White House official. Instead, his view evolved as he found himself repeatedly disappointed that Putin appeared no closer to agreeing to end the war.“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump complained Wednesday. “They just don’t go anywhere.”A day after his call with Putin, Trump met over lunch in the Cabinet Room with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The meeting was tense, and the Ukrainians left having failed to secure the long-range Tomahawk missiles they’d been seeking.But while Trump pressed Zelensky to agree to land concessions that would bring the war to a close, by the end of the meeting he’d arrived at a plan that would call for a ceasefire at the current battle lines — well short of what Putin has demanded for peace.How Trump-Zelensky meeting turned acrimonious over demands for territorial concessionsAfter a phone call Monday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, it was clear to American officials that Moscow’s stance hadn’t significantly shifted, despite what Trump believed to be a positive conversation with Putin four days earlier.The Budapest summit he’d hoped to arrange in a couple of weeks might be a “waste of time,” Trump speculated. Planning was halted.Ahead of the announcement of the new sanctions on Wednesday, Trump sat down for a meeting where the topic arose with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been a proponent of imposing sanctions on Russia for months.This time, the president surprised even some of his closest advisers by agreeing to impose sanctions on Russia’s largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Bessent returned to his office at Treasury to brief his team and compile the new sanctions into a release.Shortly afterward, Trump spoke to Rubio — who was preparing to depart for a trip to Israel — and advised him that they would be imposing the sanctions immediately.Back at the White House, Bessent teased the impending announcement in a roundabout way. After speaking with reporters in the driveway, he was walking back into the West Wing before he spun around and returned to the microphones.“We are going to either announce after the close this afternoon — or first thing tomorrow morning — a substantial pickup in Russia sanctions,” he said as reporters scrambled to get their cameras back into place.Trump’s sanctions target Russian ‘war ATM,’ but the real test is enforcementInside the building, Trump was meeting in the Oval Office with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who made the last-minute journey from Brussels as an emissary for European leaders hoping Trump would remain on Ukraine’s side.Rutte could hardly have hoped for a better outcome, as Trump spelled out his sudden decision to make good on a threat he’d been alluding to  for months.“These are very big, those are against their two big oil companies, and we hope that they won’t be on for long. We hope that the war will be settled,” Trump said.Even many inside the White House were surprised how quickly the new package of sanctions came together. Trump had told advisers for months that one day he would decide it was time to take stronger action on Russia. The president suggested to advisers that his “instincts” were telling him it was time to move in a different direction with Putin.“It was the culmination of having good calls [with Putin] and then reading the papers and seeing Russia is still” bombing Ukraine extensively, the senior White House official said.Hours before the announcement, Russia struck a Ukrainian kindergarten building in Kharkiv. Video from the scene showed terrified people running from the burning building, clutching screaming children.Trump was also motivated by the truce he helped broker in Gaza, believing it only came together after he had grown increasingly tough on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“Getting tough led to action,” the official said.Trump has received repeated calls from Sen. Lindsey Graham, along with other Republican allies, encouraging him to impose sanctions. After joining Trump for lunch in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters he wanted to bring a long-delayed sanctions bill to the floor “when the White House believes it’s useful to them to get Putin to the table and to get a deal that ends the war, so we’re prepared to act.”“We want to do everything we can to support the president, his team’s efforts and the efforts of our allies to bring the bloodshed to an end and a peaceful conclusion,” Thune said.Starting in the days after he retook office in January, Trump has held out the option of using sanctions to force Putin to the negotiating table. He said on January 22, two days after he was inaugurated and one day after his onetime deadline to end the war, that he may have no choice than to “put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Moscow.The threats continued through the spring and summer, but never materialized into new measures. Trump privately said he was concerned that tough new sanctions might push Putin further away from peace talks, officials have said – a viewpoint his top diplomat echoed in August.“The minute you issue new sanctions … our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished,” Rubio said in an interview around the time Trump met Putin in Alaska.Trump did apply new tariffs on India as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil. But he didn’t slap similar measures on Moscow’s largest customer, China, as he works to broker a new trade deal with President Xi Jinping.Trump has not ruled out meeting Putin at some point in the future when he feels the time is right.“I think the president and the entire administration hopes that one day that can happen again,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday. “But we want to make sure that there’s a tangible, positive outcome out of that meeting, and that it’s a good use of the president’s time.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

But Reagan was clear: he was “loath” to take that action and believed high tariffs had exacerbated the Great Depression.Yet by Thursday night, Trump had taken to social media to blast the ad.“The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs,” he wrote on Truth Social.He claimed the ad aimed to “interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,” and defended tariffs as critical to the US economy and national security.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” he wrote.CNN has reached out to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s office for comment, as well as the office of Dominic LeBlanc, the minister overseeing US-Canada trade.Ontario Premier Doug Ford had first posted the ad online on October 16, writing in a caption: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.”A disclaimer under the ad states that it was not approved or sponsored by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library or the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.A red tie and laughs about annexation: How Canada’s prime minister is trying to get in Trump’s good gracesAlong with its statement, the Ronald Reagan Foundation offered a link to the full unabridged version of Reagan’s decades-old speech - in which he speaks at greater length about why he opposes tariffs. “More than five million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business, and additional millions are tied to imports,” he said in one quote, which was not included in the ad.The description for the full YouTube video lists the speech as “unrestricted” in both access and use.Since Trump took office, the centuries-long friendship between the US and Canada has broken down amid bruised feelings over tariffs and Trump’s threat to make Canada the 51st US state. Many Canadians are boycotting American goods, and refusing to travel to the US.Canada has long been one of the US’ top trading partners; last year, the US imported $411.9 billion worth of goods from Canada, according to government figures.But Canada’s economy has been hit hard by Trump’s steep sectoral tariffs on autos, steel, aluminum, lumber, and energy – some of the country’s key exports to the US. Those fall under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump brokered during his first term and will be under mandatory review next year. Canada’s unemployment rate is now at its highest point in nine years.“This is the last thing that either country needs,” Jack Buffington, director of the supply chain program at the University of Denver, told CNN after Trump’s announcement. “We need to stabilize the North American supply chain, particularly given the challenges that the US has with China.”Carney won an election in April with a strident message for Canadians, warning that their relationship with America would change dramatically in the coming years. He has fostered relationships with other Western countries instead; on Thursday, before Trump’s post, he had announced on X that Canada plans to double its non-US exports in the next decade.“Our core mission is to build a stronger economy — one that doesn’t rely on a single trade partner,” he wrote on X.The economic relationship has reached a boiling point several times over the course of Trump’s second term. Earlier this year, in the relationship’s tensest moment, Ford threatened to halt exports of Canadian electricity to the United States, which would have sent US energy bills surging. But he ultimately backed off that threat. Trump has also threatened to call off talks with Canada in the past, only to restore negotiations.Tensions have eased slightly in recent months, however, with Carney meeting Trump at the Oval Office earlier this month. There, Trump joked about a “merger” of the two countries but also praised his counterpart as a “world-class leader.”LeBlanc, the Canadian trade minister, said negotiators for both countries had left with directions to “quickly land deals” on steel, aluminum and energy. He described the meeting between leaders as “successful, positive, substantial.”That brief warming of ties, it seems, is over – at least for now.This story has been updated with additional information.CNN’s Rhea Mogul and David Goldman contributed reporting.© 2025 Cable News Network.

I saw them juggling work and home. They instilled really strong values in us,\" she added.Kyei hopes to inspire more young people to consider banking as a career.\"You don't need to be a mathematician, you don't need to be an accountant and you don't need to be an economist.

In a poor country, that amounts to punishing women, say critics – simply for being women. Omer is trying to get the government to scrap that ‘period tax’.By Vania AliShareSaveGrowing up in Rawalpindi, a city adjacent to Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, Mahnoor Omer remembers the shame and anxiety she felt in school when she had periods. Going to the toilet with a sanitary pad was an act of stealth, like trying to cover up a crime.“I used to hide my pad up my sleeve like I was taking narcotics to the bathroom,” says Omer, who comes from a middle-class family – her father a businessman and her mother a homemaker. “If someone talked about it, teachers would put you down.” A classmate once told her that her mother considered pads “a waste of money”.“That’s when it hit me,” says Omer. “If middle-class families think this way, imagine how out of reach these products are for others.”Now 25, Omer has gone from cautious schoolgirl to national centrestage in a battle that could reshape menstrual hygiene in Pakistan, a country where critics say economics is compounding social stigma to punish women – simply for being women.In September, Omer, a lawyer, petitioned the Lahore High Court, challenging what she and many others say is effectively a “period tax” imposed by Pakistan on its more than 100 million women.Pakistani governments have, under the Sales Tax Act of 1990, long charged an 18 percent sales tax on locally manufactured sanitary pads and a customs tax of 25 percent on imported ones, as well as on raw materials needed to make them. Add on other local taxes, and UNICEF Pakistan says that these pads are often effectively taxed at about 40 percent.Omer’s petition argues that these taxes – which specifically affect women – are discriminatory, and violate a series of constitutional provisions that guarantee equality and dignity, elimination of exploitation and the promotion of social justice.In a country where menstruation is already a taboo subject in most families, Omer and other lawyers and activists supporting the petition say that the taxes make it even harder for most Pakistani women to access sanitary products. A standard pack of commercially branded sanitary pads in Pakistan currently costs about 450 rupees ($1.60) for 10 pieces. In a country with a per capita income of $120 a month, that’s the cost of a meal of rotis and dal for a low-income family of four. Cut the cost by 40 percent – the taxes – and the calculations become less loaded against sanitary pads.At the moment, only 12 percent of Pakistani women use commercially produced sanitary pads, according to a 2024 study by UNICEF and the WaterAid nonprofit. The rest improvise using cloth or other materials, and often do not even have access to clean water to wash themselves.“If this petition goes forward, it’s going to make pads affordable,” says Hira Amjad, the founder and executive director of Dastak Foundation, a Pakistani nonprofit whose work is focused on promoting gender equality and combating violence against women.And that, say lawyers and activists, could serve as a spark for broader social change.The court docket describes the case as Mahnoor Omer against senior officials of the government of Pakistan. But that’s not what it feels like to Omer.“It feels like women versus Pakistan.”Bushra Mahnoor, founder of Mahwari Justice, a Pakistani student-led organisation whose name translates to “menstrual justice”, realised early just how much of a struggle it could be to access sanitary pads.Mahnoor – no relation to Omer – grew up in Attock, a city in the northwestern part of Pakistan’s Punjab province, with four sisters. “Every month, I had to check if there were enough pads. If my period came when one of my sisters had hers too,” finding a pad was a challenge, she says.The struggle continued in school, where, as was the case with Omer, periods were associated with shame. A teacher once made one of her classmates stand for two entire lectures because her white uniform was stained. “That was dehumanising,” she says.Mahnoor was 10 when she had her first period. “I didn’t know how to use a pad. I stuck it upside down; the sticky side touched my skin. It was painful. No one tells you how to manage it.”She says that shame was never hers alone, but it’s part of a silence which starts at home and accompanies girls into adulthood. A study on menstrual health in Pakistan shows that eight out of 10 girls feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when talking about periods, and two out of three girls report never having received information about menstruation before it began. The findings, published in the Frontiers in Public Health journal in 2023, link this silence to poor hygiene, social exclusion and missed school days.In 2022, when floods devastated Pakistan, Mahnoor began Mahwari Justice to ensure that relief camps did not overlook the menstrual needs of women. “We began distributing pads and later realised there’s so much more to be done,” she says. Her organisation has distributed more than 100,000 period kits – each containing pads, soap, underwear, detergent and painkillers – and created rap songs and comics to normalise conversations about menstruation. “When you say the word ‘mahwari’ out loud, you’re teaching people it’s not shameful,” she says. “It’s just life.”The same floods also influenced Amjad, the Dastak Foundation founder, though her nonprofit has been around for a decade now. Its work now also includes distributing period kits during natural disasters.But the social stigma associated with menstruation is also closely tied to economics in the ways in which its impact plays out for Pakistani women, suggests Amjad.“In most households, it’s the men who make financial decisions,” she says. “Even if the woman is bringing the money, she’s giving it to the man, and he is deciding where that money needs to go.”And if the cost of women’s health feels too high, that’s often compromised. “[With] the inflated prices due to the tax, there is no conversation in many houses about whether we should buy pads,” she says. “It’s an expense they cannot afford organically.”According to the 2023 study in the Frontiers in Public Health, over half of Pakistani women are not able to afford sanitary pads.If the taxes are removed, and menstrual hygiene becomes more affordable, the benefits will extend beyond health, says Amjad.School attendance rates for girls could improve, she said. Currently, more than half of Pakistan’s girls in the five to 16 age group are not in school, according to the United Nations. “We will have stress-free women. We will have happier and healthier women.”Omer says her interest in women’s and minority rights began early. “What inspired me was just seeing the blatant mistreatment every day,” she says. “The economic, physical, and verbal exploitation that women face, whether it’s on the streets, in the media, or inside homes, never sat right with me.”She credits her mother for making her grow up to be an empathetic and understanding person.After completing school, she worked as a gender and criminal justice consultant at Crossroads Consultants, a Pakistan-based firm that collaborates with NGOs and development partners on gender and criminal justice reform. At the age of 19, she also volunteered at Aurat March, an annual women’s rights movement and protest held across Pakistan on International Women’s Day – it’s a commitment she has kept up since then.Her first step into activism came at 16, when she and her friends started putting together “dignity kits”, small care packages for women in low-income neighbourhoods of Islamabad. “We would raise funds with bake sales or use our own money,” she recalls.The money she was able to raise enabled her to distribute about 300 dignity kits that she and her friends made themselves. They each contained pads, underwear, pain medication and wipes. But she wanted to do more.She got a chance when she started working at the Supreme Court in early 2025, first as a law clerk. She’s currently pursuing postgraduate studies in gender, peace and security at the London School of Economics and says that she will go back to Pakistan to resume her practice after she graduates.She became friends with fellow lawyer Ahsan Jehangir Khan, who specialises in taxation and constitutional law. The plan to challenge the “period tax” emerged from their conversations.“He pushed me to file this petition and try to get justice instead of just sitting around.”Khan, who is Omer’s lawyer in the case, says that fighting the taxes is about more than accessibility and affordability of sanitary pads – it’s about justice. “It’s a tax on a biological function,” he says.Tax policies in Pakistan, he says, are written by “a privileged elite, mostly men who have never had to think about what this tax means for ordinary women”. The constitution, he adds, “is very clear that you cannot have anything discriminatory against any gender whatsoever”.To Amjad, the Dastak Foundation founder, the fight for menstrual hygiene is closely tied to her other passion – the struggle against climate change. The extreme weather-related crisis, such as floods, that Pakistan has faced in recent times, she says, hit women particularly hard.She remembers the trauma many women she worked with after the 2022 floods described to her. “Imagine that you are living in a tent and you have mahwari [menstruation] for the first time,” she says. “You are not mentally prepared for it. You are running for your life. You don’t have access to safety or security. That trauma is a trauma for life.”As temperatures rise on average, women will need to change sanitary pads more frequently during their periods – and a lack of adequate access will prove an even bigger problem, Amjad warns. She supports the withdrawal of taxes on sanitary pads – but only those made from cotton, not plastic ones that “take thousands of years to decompose”.Amjad is also campaigning for paid menstruation leave. “I have come across women who were fired because they had pain during periods and couldn’t work,” she says. “When you are menstruating, one part of your brain is on menstruation. You can’t really focus properly.”Meanwhile, opponents of the taxes are hoping that Omer’s petition will pressure the Pakistani government to follow other nations such as India, Nepal and the United Kingdom that have abolished their period taxes.Taking on that mantle against the government’s policies didn’t come easily to Omer. Her parents, she says, were nervous at first about their daughter going to court against the government. “They said it’s never a good idea to take on the state,” she says.Now, they’re proud of her, she says. “They understand why this matters.”To her, the case is not just a legal fight. “When I think of this case, the picture that comes to mind … It’s not a courtroom, it’s a feeling of justice,” she says. “It makes me feel a sense of pride to be able to do this and take this step without fear.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"New satellite image shows White House wing demolished as part of Trump ballroom plan","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cgmx8pwvgz0t","message":"","news":"New satellite imagery shows the East Wing of the White House has been demolished so work can begin on US President Donald Trump's new ballroomBBC Verify has been investigating the growing presence in Mali of Russian paramilitary soldiers who have replaced the Wagner Group in the countryWe're looking to verify footage posted online from southern Lebanon following reports of new Israeli strikesBBC Verify uses open-source intelligence, satellite imagery, fact-checking and data analysis to help report complex storiesThis feed is where we post our work throughout the dayGet in touch with us by following this linkEdited by Rob CorpMatt MurphyBBC Verify senior journalistHundreds of Russian soldiers from a new paramilitary force have been deployed to Mali to help quash a growing Islamist insurgency against the ruling military junta, a senior French defence official has told BBC Verify.Following the withdrawal of the Wagner Group - a Russian private military company - in June, French defence officials have been tracking the influx of the Moscow-backed Africa Corps and believe there are now 2,500 mercenaries operating in the West African country.BBC Verify has authenticated footage showing heavily armed troops associated with the paramilitary force active in combat operations in rural areas since the deployment began in June.Africa Corps operations have been extensively documented on the group’s Telegram channel and other allied social media accounts.

Ukraine has balked at this, and Trump has failed to move either side.Here is what the current front lines look like and how Russia and Ukraine have reacted to this latest proposal:Trump has proposed halting the war where the fighting is now occurring.“They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.“The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this. We take that.'”When Trump was asked if he had advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cede the whole of the eastern region of Donbas, which borders Russia and which it has laid claim to, he said no.“Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now. I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia,” Trump told a reporter from the Reuters news agency.“You leave it the way it is right now. They can … negotiate something later on down the line.”Over the course of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, Russia has seized territory primarily in four eastern and southern Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. It also controls a small pocket of Kharkiv province.Donetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas, which has seen the most fighting.Russia controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk, including the areas around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.Russia also controls about 75 percent of Kherson and Zaporizhia.Zaporizhia is a significant industrial region known for its steel, aluminium and aircraft manufacturing and is also home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.Ukraine and Europe have backed Trump’s plan to freeze the battle lines.On Tuesday, European leaders and Zelenskyy signed a statement saying they “strongly” support Trump’s proposal.“The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” the statement said.Previously, Ukraine has insisted on reclaiming all of its land. But Trump has flip-flopped over whether Ukraine should or should not be required to cede land to Russia in any peace deal.In August before a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war, Trump stated that both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war.“There’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump told reporters at the time.Then in September, Trump appeared to make a U-turn, saying Ukraine could win the war militarily and recapture the territories occupied by Russia, including the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014, and other areas in eastern Ukraine. “Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!” Trump wrote in a social media post.Russia has rejected the plan.On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to “a long-term, sustainable peace – not an immediate ceasefire that would lead nowhere”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added that “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change,” referring to its hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Russia had sent a private communique to the US over the weekend, demanding control of all of the Donbas – not just the parts it has already seized.A planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, in the next two weeks was shelved this week as Trump said he did not want a “wasted meeting” with Putin.“It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get, so I cancelled it. But we’ll do it in the future,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"What’s at stake as US and China trade negotiators meet ahead of Trump-Xi summit","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/us-china-trade-talks-malaysia-intl-hnk","message":"","news":"MarketsHot StocksFear & Greed IndexLatest Market NewsHot StocksUS and Chinese officials are set to convene another round of trade negotiations in Malaysia this weekend, as the two rival powers seek to salvage fragile relations ahead of a highly anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.Delegations led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng will set the stage for talks between Trump and Xi when they meet next Thursday in South Korea.The fifth round of trade talks comes at a precarious time for US-China relations, after both countries slapped sweeping measures on the other following months of relative calm.The two countries had struck a trade truce in May following an all-out tariff war, which was extended until November 10 before the latest shots were fired.Earlier this month, China ramped up its restrictions on rare earths, a move Beijing said was in response to Washington’s expansion of export curbs on US technology. China controls about 90% of the world’s processed output of critical minerals, which are essential to global supply chains for consumer electronics, automobiles and semiconductors.Shocked by Beijing’s actions, Trump vowed to impose an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls on “any and all critical software” starting next month. At one stage, he even threatened to cancel the meeting with Xi.The measures, ranging from tech and rare earth restrictions, are expected to be major points of contention during the talks.Before Bessent’s departure for Malaysia on Wednesday, he told Fox Business that he is “optimistic” about the upcoming talks but does not rule out further escalatory measures if a pause or relief on Beijing’s rare earths regime can’t be negotiated.“I’m hoping that we can get this ironed out this weekend so that the leaders can enter their talks on a more positive note,” he said, downplaying the Trump-Xi summit as a “pull-aside.”Reuters first reported this week that the Trump administration is considering upping the ante further with a wide array of software export restrictions spanning laptops to jet engines.When asked about the potential for additional curbs on China on Wednesday, Bessent said “everything is on the table.”“If these export controls – whether it’s software, engines or other things - happen, it will likely be in coordination with our G7 allies,” he said.China’s commerce ministry said Thursday that the two sides will discuss “key issues” in accordance with the “important consensuses reached during recent phone conversations between Xi and Trump,” without elaborating further.The leaders last spoke in mid-September following trade negotiations in Madrid led by Bessent and Li Chenggang, China’s vice minister of commerce. Trump then lauded the progress made to finalize a deal to sell TikTok’s US assets to American investors, as well as developments on trade, the illegal flow of drugs, and Russia’s war in Ukraine.At a news conference Friday, China’s commerce minister Wang Wentao urged further dialogues to “identify the right way to coexist” and stressed that China has consistently opposed decoupling.“The first four rounds of China-US economic and trade consultations have fully demonstrated that, on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultation, the two sides are fully capable of finding ways to address each other’s concerns,” he said.Despite Trump’s suggestions of a swift and successful deal with China, and multiple rounds of talks throughout the year, the standoff between the two countries has instead taken a turbulent course.In April, the tit-for-tat tariff offensive resulted in taxes on each country’s goods rising to triple-digit levels. Beijing also announced an unprecedented licensing regime to restrict the export of certain rare earths, which disrupted global productions of automobiles among others.A 90-day trade truce was brokered by Bessent and Greer’s first meeting with He in Geneva in May, reducing the sky-high levy to double digits. They subsequently met in London and Stockholm to extend the trade truce and speed up the flow of rare earths, before meeting in Madrid last month.At one point, the talks turned personal, with Bessent accusing Li, also a key negotiator in the previous rounds of trade talks, of being “very disrespectful” and “slightly unhinged.” Neither Li nor the Chinese commerce ministry has responded to this accusation.Issues dominating the weekend talks in Malaysia are also likely to feature in the much-hyped summit between Trump and Xi in the upcoming week on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).“We’ll make a deal on, I think, everything,” Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval office. “We’re going to make a deal on the rare earth.”The American president said he also expects to strike a deal on soybeans and discuss Russia’s war in Ukraine. Once the largest importer of American soybeans, China paused purchases of the product in May as bilateral frictions intensified.“What I’ll really be talking to him about is, how do we end the war with Russia and Ukraine, whether it’s through oil or energy or anything else. And I think he’s going to be very receptive,” Trump said of Xi.Trump will depart the US Friday evening for his first trip to Asia in his second term, with stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea.On Sunday, Trump will meet with Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Malaysia, which is hosting this year’s summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), before attending the ASEAN leaders working dinner. He is then due to meet the newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in Tokyo on Tuesday.The visit will be followed by a Wednesday meeting with South Korea President Lee Jae Myung in Busan. He will then deliver remarks at a luncheon for the APEC CEO summit and participate in a US-APEC leaders working dinner.CNN’s Donald Judd and Joyce Jiang contributed to this report.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

He has certainly become very wealthy, very quickly.Last week the US Department of Justice charged him with running scam compounds in Cambodia that stole billions in cryptocurrency from victims all over the world. The US Treasury Department has confiscated about $14bn (£10.5bn) worth of bitcoin that it says is linked to him - it said this was the largest ever crypto-currency seizure.His own company, the Cambodian Prince Group, describes him on its website as \"a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist\" whose \"vision and leadership have transformed Prince Group into a leading business group in Cambodia that adheres to international standards\". The BBC has contacted the Prince Group for comment.So, how much do we know about Chen Zhi, the mysterious figure allegedly running a scam empire?Brought up in Fujian province in south-eastern China, he started with a small, and apparently not very successful internet gaming company, and moved to Cambodia in either late 2010 or 2011, where he began working in the then-booming real estate sector.His arrival coincided with the start of a speculative property boom in Cambodia. It was fuelled by the availability of large tracts of land expropriated by powerful, politically-connected figures and by a flood of Chinese capital.Some of it was pouring in on the tail end of Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative to export Chinese-made infrastructure, and some of it was from individual Chinese investors seeking more affordable alternatives to China's overheated property market. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Cambodia was also rising fast.The skyline of the capital Phnom Penh changed dramatically. The characterful, low-rise cityscape of mustard-coloured French colonial mansions was transformed into another Asian high-rise forest of glass and steel towers.The transformation of Sihanoukville, a once quiet little seaside resort, was even more extreme. It was not just Chinese holidaymakers and property speculators heading there, but also gamblers - gambling is illegal in China.New casinos sprang up, alongside gaudy, luxury hotels and apartment blocks. There was plenty of money to be made.Even so, Chen Zhi's trajectory was startling.In 2014 he became a Cambodian citizen, giving up his Chinese nationality. This enabled him to buy land in his own name, but required a minimum investment or donation to the government of $250,000.It was never clear where Chen Zhi's money came from. When applying for a bank account on the Isle of Man in 2019 he listed an unnamed uncle who he said had given him $2m to start his first property company in 2011, but no evidence for this was ever provided.Chen Zhi founded the Prince Group in 2015, focused on property development, when he was still only 27 years old.He got a commercial banking licence in 2018 to establish Prince Bank. The same year he obtained a Cypriot passport, in return for a minimum investment there of $2.5m, giving him easy access to the European Union. He later acquired Vanuatu citizenship as well.He started Cambodia's third airline, and in 2020 obtained a certificate to operate a fourth. There were luxury malls in Phnom Penh built by the Prince property arm, five-star hotels in Sihanoukville, and an ambitious scheme to construct a $16bn  \"eco-city\" called \"Bay of Lights\" there.In 2020 Chen Zhi was awarded the highest title bestowed by Cambodia's king, that of \"Neak Oknha\", which requires a donation of at least $500,000 to the government.He had already been made an official adviser to Interior Minister Sar Kheng since 2017, was a business partner with his son Sar Sokha, and an official adviser to Cambodia's most powerful man Hun Sen, and later his son Hun Manet after he succeeded his father as prime minister in 2023.Chen Zhi was lauded in the local media as a philanthropist, who had funded scholarships for low-income students and donated substantially to help Cambodia deal with the Covid pandemic.Yet he remained an enigmatic figure, staying out of the limelight, making few public statements.\"Everyone I've spoken to who's worked with him directly, been in the room with him, they all describe him as very courteous, very calm, very measured,\" says Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who did a three year-long investigation of Chen Zhi which was published by Radio Free Asia last year.\"I think not being the kind of flamboyant person that people will write tabloid-y things about was smart. Even those who no longer want to be associated with him are still impressed by his quiet charisma, his gravitas.\"But where was all this wealth and power coming from?In 2019 the property bubble burst in Sihanoukville. The online gambling business had attracted Chinese criminal syndicates, who then began violent turf wars with each other. Tourists were scared off.Under pressure from China, then-prime minister Hun Sen banned online gambling in August that year. Around 450,000 Chinese left the city as its main business collapsed. Many of Prince Group's residential blocks were left empty.Yet Chen Zhi continued to expand his business interests and spend freely.According to the UK authorities, in 2019 he bought a £12m mansion in north London and a £95m office block in the city's financial district. The US says he and his associates bought properties in New York, private jets and superyachts, and a Picasso painting.And, they allege, Chen Zhi's wealth came from the most profitable business in Asia today, online fraud, and the human trafficking and money laundering that go with it.The US and UK have imposed sanctions on 128 companies linked to Chen Zhi and Prince Group, and on 17 individuals from seven different nationalities who they allege helped run his scam empire. Assets linked to Chen Zhi in the US and UK have been frozen.The sanctions announcement describes an elaborate web of shell companies and cryptocurrency wallets through which money was moved to conceal its origins.It says: \"Prince Group Transnational Crime Organisation profits from a litany of transnational crimes including sextortion - a type of fraud involving the solicitation for eventual blackmail of sexually explicit materials, often from minors - money laundering, various frauds and rackets, corruption, illegal online gambling, and the industrial-scale trafficking, torture, and extortion of enslaved workers in furtherance of the operation of at least 10 scam compounds in Cambodia.\"China too had been quietly investigating the Prince Group since at least 2020. There have been a number of court cases accusing the company of running online fraud schemes.The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has established a task force \"to investigate the \"Prince Group, a major transnational online gambling syndicate based in Cambodia\".At its heart, the US and UK allege, were businesses like Golden Fortune Science and Technology Park, a compound built by the Prince Group in Chrey Thom, close to the Vietnamese border.In the past the Prince Group has denied any involvement in scams, and said it no longer has any connection to Golden Fortune, but the US and UK investigation argues that there is still a clear business link between them.Mr Adamovic Davies interviewed a number of people living and working near Golden Fortune for his investigation into Chen Zhi. They described brutal beatings of the mainly Chinese, Vietnamese and Malaysians who tried to escape from the compound, where they were forced to run online scams.\"I think it's the sheer scale of his operations which really makes Chen Zhi stand out,\" he says, adding that it is shocking the Prince Group was able to build a \"global footprint\" without raising alarm bells given the serious criminal charges it now faces.\"What should be uncomfortable for a lot of people is that Chen Zhi should never have been able to acquire all these assets, in Singapore, London or the US. Lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, bankers, all should have been looking at this group and saying, hang on, this doesn't add up. And they didn't.\"Today, after all the publicity generated by the US and UK sanctions, businesses are rushing to dissociate themselves from the Prince Group.The Cambodian Central Bank has had to issue a statement to nervous depositors assuring them they will be able to withdraw their funds from Prince Bank. The South Korean authorities have frozen $64m of its deposits held by Korean banks.The Singapore and Thai governments are promising investigations into Prince subsidiaries in their jurisdictions - of the 18 individuals targeted by the US and UK, three are Singaporeans.Cambodia's government has said little, apart from urging the US and UK authorities to be sure they have sufficient evidence for their allegations.But it will be difficult for Cambodia's ruling elite to distance themselves from Chen Zhi, after being so close to him for so long. Cambodia was already facing growing pressure over its tolerance of scam businesses, which some estimate may account for around half of the entire economy.And what of Chen Zhi himself?Nothing has been heard or seen of him since the sanctions were announced last week. The enigmatic tycoon, once among the most powerful figures in Cambodia, appears to have vanished.China is emphasising technological self sufficiency and domestic spending while keeping a laser focus on corruption.The bus caught fire following a collision with a motorcycle on a highway in Andhra Pradesh state.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.Zhang Shengmin heads anti-corruption efforts in the army and is seen as a trusted loyalist of President Xi.Authorities have issued a rare red wind warning, the highest alert level, for the capital Wellington.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Recent data shows that 64% of them practise in the vast underserved rural areas where American graduates are reluctant to work, filling a crucial gap in the country's healthcare system. Many of these doctors are on H-1B visas and some even spend their entire careers on them as they wait for a green card, making them vulnerable to unexpected job losses and long-term instability.So last month's announcement by Donald Trump's administration that it will hike skilled-worker H-1B visa fees for new applicants to $100,000 (£74,359) sparked fear and anxiety among the roughly 50,000 India-trained doctors working in the US. In the days after the move, there was little clarity on how it would affect medical professionals, fuelling uncertainty about their futures, even for those who have spent years building careers and communities in the US.As outrage spread, a White House spokesperson told Bloomberg via email on 22 September that \"the proclamation allows for potential exemptions, which can include physicians and medical residents\". On Monday, US officials announced that the fee \"does not apply to any previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas\".While this clarification may give some relief to doctors who are already working on H1-B visas in the US, there are still questions around whether the steady supply of Indian medical professionals to the US would continue in the future.The earlier executive order on the visa hike says that the higher fees can be waived if the secretary of Homeland Security establishes that appointing certain workers is \"in the national interest\". But the medical industry and groups point out there is no indication that any category of workers, including those in the medical field, has been exempted from this fee.Many worry that higher costs for hospitals to hire doctors and other workers could ripple through the system. Last month, more than 50 groups led by the American Medical Association (AMA) wrote to Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, emphasising that the fee hike could discourage hospitals from hiring H-1B doctors, affecting future supply pipelines and limiting patients' access to care in communities that need it the most.\"We have heard from health systems who say this fee would be devastating,\" says Dr Bobby Mukkamala, president of the AMA. The son of Indian immigrant doctors, Dr Mukkamala is the first Indian-origin doctor to head the AMA.According to research, one in five immigrant doctors in the US is of Indian origin.Supporters of the hike argue that tighter immigration policies are necessary to keep American jobs for Americans.But research from the University of California San Diego's (UCSD's) School of Global Policy and Strategy shows that relaxed visa requirements don't impact the jobs of US medical graduates. In fact, it enables more foreign-trained doctors to practise in remote and low-income areas.The AMA also emphasises that \"international medical graduates are not taking jobs from US physicians\", but are instead \"filling critical gaps in care\".Like several other western countries, the US has long faced a shortage of doctors and nurses. The UCSD study projects that the country will face a shortfall of 124,000 doctors by 2034.The impact will be particularly felt in the countryside as most American medical graduates opt for bigger cities with better amenities, says Dr Satheesh Kathula, president (2024-25) of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin.Economics widens the gap as wealthy urban hospital systems easily outbid the struggling rural ones by offering better salaries, adds Geeta Minocha, a Stanford medical student raised in rural Florida.So any hike in the fee would make it harder to bring in new clinicians from abroad, putting additional financial pressure on rural hospitals that are already stretched thin, experts say.And it's not just remote towns. The country's capital Washington and several states, including Michigan, New Jersey, Florida, New York and California, rely heavily on immigrant physicians, who comprise more than 30% of the doctors there.In his book, Immigrant Doctors: Chasing the Big American Dream, Dr Kathula tells several stories of Indian medical graduates in the US who did their work at the cost of their own welfare.\"They have died serving our country during the HIV crisis of the 1980s-1990s when laboratory staff were reluctant to even draw blood, and during the recent Covid-19 pandemic,\" he says. \"I know doctors who were treating patients here but could not travel to attend their own parents' funeral in India during the pandemic.\"Many of these professionals started arriving in the 1960s when the US opened its doors to fulfil surging demand, attracting thousands of highly trained doctors from developing nations such as India.Most of them enter the US on J-1 visas for clinical residency training.After completing their medical residency, they either switch to H-1B visas if a willing hospital sponsors them or must return to their home country as per the terms of the J-1 visa (which requires them to go back for at least two years before applying again).In 1990, to fix acute doctor shortages, the US government created an exception. It waived the two-year return requirement for doctors willing to work in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) - regions where there are not enough doctors to meet the population's healthcare needs. This waiver - the Conrad waiver - gives foreign doctors the opportunity to continue working in the US on H-1B visas tied to serving in HPSA areas once their clinical training on J-1 visa ends.One such HPSA is deep inside south Alabama, where Dr Rakesh Kanipakam, a doctor trained in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, travels hundreds of miles every week to treat patients with failing kidneys.\"We serve clinics in three cities, five countryside clinics and dialysis centres in a 100-mile radius,\" he says. \"The entire place had just one nephrologist but now even he is retiring.\"Foreign medical workers also contribute millions of dollars to the US economy.Back in Batesville, Dr Anantha's colleagues credit him for transforming their hospital into a centre of excellence.In a letter written in support of Dr Anantha's green card application, the hospital CEO said the doctor had bolstered the facility's financial stability by over $40m annually and has also brought them many awards in the field of healthcare.For now, the AMA says it is feeling \"encouraged by the administration's openness to an exemption\".But Dr Mukkamala warns that action on this needs to happen quickly \"because international medical graduates are determining their next steps now and the possibility of this fee hike could deter highly qualified physicians from working in the US\".Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.Prosecutors said the elaborate plot, which allegedly netted $7m from victims, belonged in a Hollywood film.The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.India team will require self-belief and the zeal to clinch its long-standing dream.It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.Rory Friers spent six months with residents and staff of Glendun Care Home in Cushendun in 2022.Copyright 2025 BBC.

On Thursday, the FBI also carried out arrests, including of NBA players allegedly involved in the scam.The news came during the NBA season’s opening week, just as the league launched new broadcast deals worth $76bn over 11 years. It’s the latest in a series of scandals to hit US sport since sports betting took off in 2018.Here is what we know.A sweeping federal investigation has shaken the world of professional basketball, uncovering ties between NBA figures and organised crime in an illegal betting network worth millions of dollars.“The investigative work that culminated with this morning’s operation are reminiscent of a Hollywood movie. But this was not luck, and it was not theatrics,” said Ricky Patel, the special agent in charge of homeland security investigations, who has led the ongoing probe.In total, 34 individuals were arrested across 11 states. Among those arrested were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, and former Cleveland Cavaliers player Damon Jones.Authorities said they unsealed the indictments and carried out coordinated arrests nationwide on Thursday.pic.twitter.com/UcOBnWxe00— FBI (@FBI) October 23, 2025First indictment: Sports betting scheme (US v Eric Earnest Indictment)In the first case, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and several others are accused of using insider information, knowing when players would sit out or leave early with “injuries”, to place targeted bets on those athletes underperforming in points, assists or rebounds.“They also misused information obtained through longstanding friendships that they had with NBA players and coaches,” Joseph Nocella, the interim US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said.The indictment highlights seven games in 2023 and 2024 on which hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of illegal bets were allegedly placed.Rozier’s lawyer denies all charges and said that his client will fight the legal accusations.Second indictment: Poker cheating operation (United States v Aiello)The second case centres on a sophisticated poker-cheating ring allegedly orchestrated by organised crime groups in New York.According to prosecutors, victims were drawn into high-stakes poker games after being told they would compete against well-known former athletes, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups.But the games were rigged. Crime groups allegedly used fake shuffling machines and an X-ray poker table that showed players’ hidden cards, letting them cheat victims out of huge sums.Officials say victims lost at least $7m overall. Those charged include game organisers, suppliers of the cheating equipment, and participants, among them Billups, who allegedly took part in several such games in 2019.Prosecutors say the scheme was backed by members of the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese crime families, which controlled portions of New York’s underground poker circuit. These groups allegedly collected a share of the profits, enforced payments through extortion and robbery, and laundered proceeds via cryptocurrency and other channels.Along with the Colombo family, the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese groups represent the “Five Families”, which have dominated New York’s Italian-American mafia since 1931. They form part of a broader American-Sicilian network known as La Cosa Nostra (Our Thing), whose members maintain ties to their counterparts in Sicily.Thirteen members and associates of the crime families were also indicted.These are the defendants named in the indictments that include former and current NBA players:Chauncey Billups: Portland Trail Blazers head coach. Billups is alleged to have functioned as a “face card” (a celebrity figure used to attract players) for poker games that were rigged. Billups was also a star player in his time, a part of the NBA for 17 years, most of those years with the Detroit Pistons.Damon Jones: Former NBA player and assistant coach for Los Angeles in 2022-23. Jones is accused of supplying inside information to allow a network of conspirators to place winning bets on games. And like Billups, he is also accused of helping to lure wealthy people to participate in poker games.Terry Rozier: An NBA player who, as a member of the Charlotte Hornets, is accused of providing insider information about his playing status to people involved in illegal sports betting. Federal investigators allege that before a 2023 Charlotte Hornets game, Rozier told associates he’d leave early due to an injury, leading to heavy bets on his “unders”.Between December 2022 and March 2024, the defendants allegedly ran a plan to profit from insider NBA information by placing bets that were almost guaranteed to win, then hiding the money trail afterwards.Some of the methodologies include:According to the indictment, the defendants and their partners used high-tech cheating devices and secret communication systems to control the outcome of underground poker games.Some of the methods include:The hidden readerOther tools used:The defendants also occasionally used other technologies, including:According to experts, this is unexpected.“The idea that poker would be at least part of today’s news was unexpected,” Mike McCann, professor of law at Harvard University, told Al Jazeera.“And also the alleged role of the mafia, that there are mafia ties to this, that kind of came out of nowhere,” he added.In a statement issued on Thursday, the NBA said it is currently reviewing the newly announced federal indictments and is cooperating fully with authorities.The league also confirmed that Rozier and Billups have been placed on immediate leave from their respective teams.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"The East Wing is gone, and Trump turns to damage control","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/23/trump-ballroom-white-house-east-wing/","message":"","news":"Demolition crews finished taking down the White House wing Thursday while President Donald Trump defended the project.The East Wing of the White House is gone.Wrecking crews had completely removed the decades-old annex by midday Thursday, just three days after they started, to make way for a pet project of President Donald Trump: a 90,000-square-foot ballroom.

His fishing boat had capsized.Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned.\"When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,\" said Mr Hong.Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats sunk or capsized.\"The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,\" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association.\"Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.\"Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C.Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to \"stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters\".On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.\"I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,\" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. \"The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\"A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.\"Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,\" he said. \"If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.\"Professor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.\"Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,\" he told the BBC.Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.One foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled.As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.\"In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,\" he said. \"But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish.\"This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.\"The haul is basically worthless,\" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.\"The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,\" Park continued. \"I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.\"And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier.Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as \"a vicious and tragic cycle\".When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, \"you have a higher chance of meeting disaster\", she explained.On 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery.One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat.\"It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,\" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. \"Ultimately it is their call when to go out,\" she said.As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. \"Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,\" she said.Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. \"Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.\"The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.Because the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.\"The future looks very bleak,\" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last.\"Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.\"\"These days it's just really tough.\"Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun ChoiA committee of MPs says the government has not demonstrated if economic benefits from airport expansion outweigh climate impacts.Three people are on trial accused of spraying Stonehenge with orange powder.Labour ministers have been criticised for giving less than 8% of a £360m package to Scotland, which lands more than half of the UK's catch .Mark Požlep's new work goes on display inside St Clement's Church as part of the Spill Festival.Jersey's environment panel wants clarity about claims over French scallop import rules.Copyright 2025 BBC.

That arrest triggered Turkiye’s biggest protests in more than a decade and a sharp sell-off of the lira, the national currency.Earlier this month, the party’s Istanbul head was removed from office after a court said delegates’ votes in a CHP provincial congress were influenced by cash payments. The party went on to expel the court-named successor from the party.And recently it emerged that prosecutors were seeking a total of 415 years in prison for Riza Akpolat, mayor of the Istanbul district of Besiktas, who was accused of bid rigging.The CHP claims that all charges are politically motivated, with Ozel having publicly accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of mounting a “coup against the future ruling party” in a bid to institute one-party rule in the country.The Turkish government maintains that the judiciary is independent and denies political motives for the investigations into what Erdogan has described as a corrupt network resembling “an octopus whose arms stretch to other parts of Turkiye and abroad”.Ahead of the 2028 presidential election, most polls show the CHP neck and neck with Erdogan’s AK Party.Reporting from Ankara, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said the case was “critical” and that the ruling would “boost his [Ozel’s] legitimacy” and allow him to “strengthen his base” ahead of the 2028 election.She said the court had “probably hesitated to give such an annulment decision”.“When you ask constitutional experts, they have always said that any allegation within a political party must be dealt [with] by the higher election board because the political parties are private entities. A local court may not interfere,” she said.Posting on X days before Friday’s verdict, Ozel said the party’s supporters would “march forward without fear, without division, growing hope”.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Why ‘India’s Picasso’ is breaking auction records — and enraging the Hindu right","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/india-mf-husain-art-intl-hnk-dst","message":"","news":"For the complex legacy of M.F. Husain, one of 20th-century India’s most important artists, this year has been a tale of two auctions.In March, one of the late painter’s monumental depictions of rural life, the 14-foot-long “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” became the most expensive modern Indian artwork ever to go under the hammer. The $13.75 million price tag almost doubled the previous record, with onlookers at Christie’s in New York bursting into spontaneous applause.Three months later, an auction of 25 long-lost Husain paintings in Mumbai was far less celebratory. Police patrolled the premises and erected barricades at the auctioneer’s office after a right-wing Hindu nationalist group warned of “strong public agitation” if calls to cancel the sale — due to Husain’s “vulgar and obscene” portrayals of sacred figures — were ignored.The auction went ahead without incident. But the contrasting moods exemplified the painter’s status as one of Indian art’s most celebrated but controversial names. As if to further underscore his polarized reputation, this year also saw a Delhi court order the seizure of two “offensive” Husain paintings, while, earlier this month, the Qatar Foundation announced plans for an entire museum dedicated to his work (Qatar had given Husain citizenship after he fled India, in 2006, fearing for his safety).Known for bold, colorful explorations of folk and pop culture, Husain was lauded as a pioneer of Indian modernism and often dubbed “India’s Picasso.” His paintings played with icons in all their forms, from Mother Teresa and Indira Gandhi to Bollywood stars and mythological figures from literary epics.The artist’s portrayals of nude Hindu deities, however, stand accused of offending religious sentiments — a reaction his supporters believe is exacerbated by his Muslim heritage. As a result, his later life was dogged by protests, legal action, death threats and an arrest warrant. Despite later being exonerated by India’s supreme court, he died in self-imposed exile, in London, in 2011. In its statement opposing June’s Mumbai auction, right-wing group Hindu Janajagruti Samiti said that Husain “deliberately painted vulgar and obscene images of goddesses … thereby gravely hurting the sentiments of millions of Hindus in the world.”The rekindling of old grievances, almost 15 years after his death, may be down to burgeoning interest from the global art market. But reactions to Husain’s work are also a bellwether of Hindu nationalism, according to Dr. Diva Gujral, an art history fellow at the University of Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art. While many of his most contentious works were produced in the 1970s, it is no coincidence that protests only erupted in 1990s, a decade when the Hindutva ideology flourished, communal tensions deepened and, Gujral said, Muslims became “a lightning rod” in India.“The reception of Husain is such a good litmus test for Indian cultural politics, because there are times when it wasn’t controversial,” she added, calling the reactions a “way to take the temperature of the country.”Hailing from an Indian branch of the Sulaymani Bohras, a Muslim sect residing primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, Husain was exposed to both Hindu and Islamic art from a young age.He was born in 1915 in Pandharpur, a pilgrimage town dotted with Hindu temples in western India. After his mother’s death, he was sent to study Urdu and Islamic calligraphy at his grandfather’s madrassa in Sidhpur, Gujarat. Husain later lived in the city of Indore and immersed himself in folk traditions, like performances of the Hindu epic “Ramayana,” before enrolling in art lessons at the local art institute. In 1934, he sold his first painting on a roadside for 10 rupees.His interest in iconography always stretched far beyond religion. In his early 20s, Husain moved to Mumbai to paint billboards for the nascent Hindi film industry. It would prove a formative experience — one that shaped his fascination with contemporary idols and Bollywood, as well as his penchant for vivid colors and flattened, figurative forms.Then, in 1947, came another decisive moment in the artist’s life: India’s independence from colonial rule and Britain’s partition of the subcontinent into a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Partly inspired by the religious strife that ensued, the painter co-founded the Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), alongside major figures like F.N. Souza and S.H. Raza, later that year.The avant-garde group sought to forge a new visual language of — and for — India. Rejecting revivalist nationalism, its members fused local art traditions with outside influences, especially those of European modernists like Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse (though Husain also traveled to China in the early 1950s), as they interrogated their country’s emerging identity.“It was about creating something new, breaking with the past,” said Gujra adding that the group did more than “simply take” from Western art. “They’re reinvigorating a language that’s made available to them through access to places like London and Paris. But it’s very much their own thing.”For Husain, this meant a Cubist-inspired style rooted firmly in the Indian experience. It is an approach epitomized by the record-breaking “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” which he produced in 1954, though it went largely unseen for seven decades before going on sale at Christie’s this year. The narrative painting comprises 13 vibrant vignettes, each containing a snippet of rural life. Abstracted villagers are depicted working the land, milling grain and tending to livestock. Elsewhere, a farmer symbolically reaches out of his portrait’s frame to hold up a landscape in a neighboring vignette.“It’s literally the farmer supporting the land, and supporting the state and the nation,” said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian modern and contemporary art at Christie’s. “This is Husain’s way of saying that, while we may be modernizing, post-independence, and entering this new era, it’s very important not to forget that the basis of the country is its rural folk.”Despite the public attention Husain’s later work attracted, his most valuable paintings emerged during this early period, Avari said. “He’s playing this critical role of defining what it is to be an Indian artist in the new country of India, and what Indian modern art really means,” he added. “He’s a linchpin figure in defining this moment.”As many of Husain’s contemporaries moved overseas (including Souza and Raza, who relocated to the UK and France, respectively), the painter remained in India, his eternal muse. He nonetheless enjoyed some global recognition, exhibiting in New York City in 1964 and participating in the 1971 São Paulo Biennial in Brazil alongside Picasso. This period also saw Husain exploring female forms, including images of Hindu goddesses like Durga and Lakshmi, sometimes in suggestive or erotic poses.Husain maintained that he never intended to degrade these deities. His subjects were not the goddesses themselves, but their iconography — how they appeared in temple art, sculptures and friezes. Their nudity was drawn from Indian art history, not his imagination, though the paintings were nonetheless viewed by some critics as a “kind of desacralizing act,” said the University of Oxford’s Gujra.“In Hindu nationalist politics, the bogeyman is the Muslim invader who outrages the modesty of the Hindu woman,” she said. “For a lot of your average Indian viewers who didn’t have an enduring understanding of the nude and its art historical heritage… he becomes the Muslim disrobing the Hindu woman.”“It reignited old ideas of the Muslim taking what isn’t his,” she added. “But the idea for Husain is that this heritage belongs to all of us.”The entire 1980s passed before the paintings faced significant religious backlash. In that time, Husain was even welcomed into the political establishment as a member of the Indian parliament’s upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where he served until 1992.But everything changed in the fall of 1996, when a Hindu monthly magazine, Vichar Mimansa, published the artist’s nude depiction of the goddess Saraswati alongside an article headlined “M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher.” The incident led to multiple criminal complaints against Husain, who was then aged in his early 80s, beginning a chain of events that led to his self-imposed exile.In 1998, Hindu fundamentalists attacked Husain’s Mumbai home and galleries displaying his work. Eight years later, another hardline group offered a 510-million-rupee (then $11.5 million) cash reward for his murder. The protests stretched beyond India’s borders, too, with London’s Asia House controversially canceling an exhibition of Husain’s work in 2006, citing security concerns, after Hindu groups demanded its closure and vandals defaced two of his paintings.That year, a court in Indore issued an arrest warrant for Husain. The offending image, this time, was a more recent painting that reimagined the map of India as a naked woman on her knees, city names marking her body. The artist publicly apologized for causing offense and denied giving it the name “Bharat Mata” — or Mother India, a personification of the nation — claiming the work was untitled. This did little to appease his critics.Concerned for his safety and facing hundreds — or as he later suggested, thousands — of legal cases, Husain left India in 2006. The Delhi High Court and, later, India’s Supreme Court eventually rejected calls for Husain’s summons and cleared him of obscenity charges, effectively quashing cases in other cities. In its ruling, in 2008, the Supreme Court criticized the emergence of a “new puritanism” in India, stating that erotic sculptures were a common sight in Hindu temples. Yet, Husain never felt it was safe to return to the country again.His plight meanwhile became a rallying cry for supporters of Indian secularism. Novelist Salman Rushdie was among those to criticize the Indian government for its “inadequate” protection of Husain and the freedom of expression he represented. “Violence and its ugly sisters, both Hindu and Islamic, have to be resisted,” Rushdie said at an address in Delhi in 2010. “They must be rebuffed. To appease it is the best way to ensure their growth. I am afraid India is going that way.”Husain spent most of his final years in Dubai, Doha and London. Upon surrendering his Indian passport to apply for Qatari citizenship, he is reported to have said: “India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country. What I have surrendered is just a piece of paper.”He also often spoke of his desire to return home — including to his friend Abhishek Poddar, a prominent collector and founder of Bangalore’s Museum of Art & Photography, who regularly mailed Husain his favorite Indore newspaper. “His love was India, and he always missed India,” said Poddar. “I once said, ‘What is it that you miss? And he said, ‘What I really miss is the earth there. The mud.’”Husain’s goddess paintings were just a fraction of his life’s work. Even the most conservative estimates put his total output at 30,000 to 40,000 artworks, spanning printmaking, writing and filmmaking of both the arthouse and Bollywood variety. He was similarly prolific after leaving India: In 2007, he completed 51 paintings inspired by the Bollywood classic “Mughal-e-Azam,” and was, at the time of his death, working on a series of 99 artworks, reflecting the 99 names of Allah, telling the history of Arab civilization.“He needed to paint all the time,” said Poddar, who first met Husain as the artist waited for a lift, without shoes, at a Kolkata bus stop in the early 1980s. (The 57-year-old collector, then a teenage art enthusiast, approached Husain after recognizing his flowing white beard from a weekly magazine, and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship.) “I once saw him at his London property where he had between 25 and 30 works. I met him again two or three days later, and lo and behold, there were another 12 or 13.”“There would have been at least a dozen occasions when he’s sitting with me and he’s drawing somebody’s portrait,” added Poddar, who holds several Husain works in his museum’s collection.Husain painted anywhere and everywhere. Renowned as a showman, he even painted during live performances and immediately auctioned off the resulting works. Taking commissions from Gulf royals and industrialist billionaires, he was something of an art-world celebrity, his distinctive appearance, designer suits and reputation for walking around shoeless all part of his own icon-building.“He was known as the barefoot artist,” said Avari, the Christie’s specialist. “He made that a thing. He would walk around with this very long paint brush, using it as a cane. There was no mistaking the figure of Husain wherever he went.“I don’t know anybody who doesn’t have a Husain story,” he added.But if Husain was, to use Poddar’s words, a “brilliant marketing man,” is it plausible that he had attempted to exploit religious outrage to serve his own ends? Gujra described the painter as a “contrarian” who “definitely liked controversy,” though she suggests he would neither have intended nor anticipated the reaction his work provoked. “He was interested in mass images,” she explained.Poddar meanwhile argued that his fiercely secular friend treated Hindu icons the same as all his other subjects. In fact, Husain was also accused of blasphemy by Islamic groups over a song in his 2004 movie “Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities,” as its lyrics used words directly from the Quran.“If there were a pantheon of figures associated with Islam, I don’t think he would have looked at that any differently from the way he looked at Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism or whatever else,” said Poddar.“I don’t think he ever had an anti-Hindu agenda,” he added. “Ever.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos, in compliance with our policy.It’s day 25. You wake up in your bunk pod in a snow-capped Martian landscape, far from civilization. Outside it’s -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit). After meditating and eating a breakfast of freeze-dried dumplings, you and your six-person crew don space suits over your thermal underwear and head out into the sandstorm on a mission.This isn’t a fever dream. It’s a month-long survival challenge deep in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert that’s designed to simulate life on Mars — for tourists.The project, called the MARS-V Project, is under development by MARS-V, a non-governmental organization based in Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar. They’re working to build a fully-fledged Mars analog station in the Gobi to prepare for human travel to the red planet — and expect to welcome the first tourists to the mock Mars camp by 2029.Nowhere on Earth mimics the geography and climate of Mars more closely than Mongolia’s Gobi. An arid, barren landscape with extreme temperature swings from 45 to -40 degrees Celsius (113 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit). The iron oxide-tinted soil has a reddish hue,  making it look eerily Martian.This combination of isolation, altitude and temperature is what makes the site so scientifically valuable as a training ground for scientists and astronauts — and as a test site for equipment and rovers.For MARS-V, it also offers another potential: tourism.“Your objective is to survive in an environment that is very, very isolated,’ says Enkhtuvshin Doyodkhuu, MARS-V CEO. “You have to have this simulation mindset that you’re on another planet: you need to feel that if you don’t follow protocol, you die.”Each participant will have to pass physical, psychological and mental agility tests, then undergo a three-month virtual astronaut training program on everything from oxygen protocol to the psychology of isolation.Once you arrive in Mongolia, it’s three days of in-person drills in Ulaanbaatar with your new teammates before handing in your phone and beginning the ten-hour journey by bumpy road to the site, drifting away from civilization across stretches of pale-red dust.“It’s surreal,” says Doyodkhuu. “This feeling of vastness, of endless empty space — the Gobi really gives you that “Mad Max” kind of feeling. It’s beautiful if you think about it, but it can be overwhelming to some.”Your home for the month? Mars “habitats” — interconnected modular pods with living quarters, a laboratory, and a greenhouse. Each day begins with the same strict daily regimen that real astronauts might face: vitamins, meditation, exercise, breakfast, and a team briefing for the day ahead.“Meditation has to be a big part of the program,” says Doyodkhuu. “One very risky thing when it comes to Mars pioneers is we don’t really know what’s going to happen with their psychology, because no other person has been away from Earth that long.”Doyodkhuu says the Mars simulation for tourists could have a similar psychological effect.“You’ll have this sort of claustrophobia; you’ll miss your Earth.”Days at the Mars-V camp are filled with challenges and tasks: for example, the crew might take the rover out to conduct geological mapping or collect soil samples. Communication with “Earth” (the Mars-V mission support team) happens on a timed delay to mimic interplanetary lag. Simulations take place between October and March in brutal winter conditions, when the Gobi freezes solid.Riding the Trans-Mongolian Railway, one of the world’s most epic train journeys“Minus 27 degrees Celsius (-16.6 degrees Fahrenheit) would be a warm day,” laughs the CEO. Crews wear thermal base layers, overalls, and analog spacesuits when working outdoors.To make it as realistic as possible, the team from Mars-V will hide all external support out of sight.“Compared to an Arctic expedition, this is controlled,” Doyodkhuu says. “If there was any real chance of death, we’d stop the simulation.”Meals will feature freeze-dried Mongolian dishes — like rehydrated dumplings or mutton stews — designed to mimic astronaut rations while honoring local culture.There’s even a design echo between the nomadic Mongolian ger — the traditional felt tent sometimes referred to as yurts — and the Martian dome prototypes being developed by the MARS-V engineering team.“We [Mongolians] have thousands of years of history living in isolated places, with very limited resources,” Doyodkhuu explains. “We’re just taking that idea to another planet.”The idea of trialing planetary life on Earth isn’t new. NASA and ESA have long used analog sites for experiments and training.But MARS-V’s plan to merge scientific research with tourism arrives at a pivotal moment: private space travel is finally edging into the mainstream. SpaceX and Blue Origin are drawing celebrities like Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, and Kim Kardashian into a new era of luxury space tourism.But, for those who can’t afford a $28 million ticket to space, Mongolia’s MARS-V camp will offer a more accessible way to experience that cosmic allure at a fraction of the cost, expected to be around $6,000 per person for a month at the camp, and pre-camp training and evaluation.It’s Mars tourism, without the launch cost — or the suffocating risk of decompression.MARS-V’s analog station is in the early stages of development, with designs for the habitat, space suits and food completed. Doyodkhuu says they expect the habitats to be ready and open to the public within the next two to three years.For those drawn to the idea of other planets, MARS-V promises a glimpse of a Martian future.“You have a lot of time to think out there,” says Doyodkhuu. “Being in this otherworldly place for one month trying to survive with five other people, it gives you this renewed outlook on life.”“If you believe that humans will become a multiplanetary species in the future, actually being part of this history, going to an analog astronaut training center and  challenging yourself, is going to leave a big impact on people.”For the right traveler — whether thrill-seeker, explorer or space enthusiast — it may be the ultimate holiday. But if the thought of freezing cold isolation and bunk pods sounds more like punishment than adventure, Mongolia’s Gobi already offers glimpses of the otherworldly in a far more comfortable setting.This remote eco-lodge offers travelers a rare opportunity to experience Mongolia’s GobiDuring the summer at the Gobi’s luxury Three Camel Lodge, travelers can switch thermals for a spa towel and freeze-dried stews for an extensive whiskey selection. You will still need to strap in for the journey though, it takes 7-8 hours to reach the lodge from Ulaanbaatar.

Since then, residents have been tentatively returning to their homes, often to find them destroyed.Alfatih Bashir’s house in Omdurman, which he built using all his savings, has collapsed ceilings and damaged walls. “I built it when I was working abroad,” Bashir told Al Jazeera, adding that now he did not posses the necessary funds to repair the damage.“I’m not working, I’m just sitting idly with my wife and two children. We sometimes barely have enough to eat. How can I even start to rebuild?” he said.Authorities are still assessing how many houses have been damaged in the conflict, but the scars of the battle between the military and the RSF are visible across the capital.Another resident, Afaf Khamed, said she fainted when she saw the extent of the damage.“This house is where we were born, where all our family members got married. I now live here with my sister, and we can’t rebuild because we don’t have anyone to help us,” she told Al Jazeera.The collapse of the local currency makes reconstruction an impossible feat even for those who have retained a job during the war. While salaries have remained stable, the Sudanese pound spiked from 600 pounds to the US dollar in April 2023, when the conflict started, to 3,500 pounds.Goods are also hard to come by in the war-torn country, hampering reconstruction. Shop owner Mohammed Ali said materials take too long to arrive because of security checks, and that makes them more expensive. As a consequence, “fewer and fewer people are coming to buy building materials”, he said.Sudan’s government has pledged to rebuild the capital, but its focus as so far has been on state institutions, while residents are left to figure out how to rebuild on their own.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Trump will meet China's Xi in South Korea, says White House","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw9vy19qvgo","message":"","news":"US President Donald Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea on 30 October on the sidelines of a summit in Asia, the White House has confirmed.The meeting between Xi and Trump has been in the works for weeks but was called into question as tensions between the world's two largest economies continued to rise.It will be the first face-to-face meeting for both leaders since Trump's return to office.Trump has threatened to impose an extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods from November if China does not roll back its tightened restrictions on its rare earth exports.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the meeting in a briefing on ThursdayThe bilteral meeting will happen at the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Summit (Apec), which takes place from the 31 October - 1 November this year in South Korea's eastern city of Gyeongju.\"We have a pretty long meeting scheduled,\" Trump had said earlier. \"We can work out a lot of our doubts and questions and our tremendous assets together.\"He added: \"I think something will work out. We have a very good relationship, but that will be a big one.\"China's commerce minister Wang Wentao expressed optimism on Friday over the upcoming negotiations with the US.He said past rounds of talks showed that \"it is entirely possible to find solutions to each other's concerns\" and \"promote the healthy, stable and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations\".Trump is also set to meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung during his visit, and participate in a working dinner for leaders.It is part of a wider trip that Trump is taking to Asia, which also includes a stop for him at a meeting in Malaysia on Sunday for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He will also meet leaders from Malaysia, South Korea and Japan - notably the latter's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Leavitt said.Trump and Xi have spoken at least three times this year, most recently in September, when they discussed a deal over TikTok's operations in the US.They last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as president.Trump has said that speaking directly to Xi was the most effective approach to resolving persistent tensions between the US and China, like tariffs, trade disputes, fentanyl trafficking and other issues.The US and China have clung to a fragile trade ceasefire brokered in May, preventing triple-digit tariffs that was threatened between both countries.But in October, China tightened export controls on rare earths - leading Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. He slammed Beijing in a post on social media, accusing it of trying to hold the world \"captive\" and of becoming \"very hostile\".Trump had then threatened to pull out of the upcoming meeting.China dominates production of rare earths and certain other materials, which are key components in cars, smartphones and many other items.The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.China is emphasising technological self sufficiency and domestic spending while keeping a laser focus on corruption.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.A former White House chief ethics lawyer described the ballroom donations as an ethical \"nightmare\".Plastic recycling plants in Europe are being shut as they struggle to find a business modelCopyright 2025 BBC.

It is the largest deployment there for decades.Long-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out \"bomber attack demonstrations\" off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela too, as tensions have escalated.The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry \"narcotics\" and \"narco-terrorists\", without providing evidence or details about those on board.The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. They are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from power.\"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank.He argues the military build-up is a show of strength intended to \"strike fear\" in the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.BBC Verify has been monitoring publicly available tracking information from US ships and planes in the region - along with satellite imagery and images on social media - to try to build a picture of where Trump's forces are located.The deployment has been changing, so we have been monitoring the region regularly for updates.As of 23 October, we identified 10 US military ships in the region, including guided missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and oil tankers for refuelling vessels at sea.It is no secret that the US administration, particularly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would like to see Maduro toppled.Earlier this year, he told Fox News Maduro was a \"horrible dictator\" and when asked whether he was demanding that Maduro leave, added: \"We're going to work on that policy.\"But, even for overt critics of Maduro like Rubio, it is difficult to explicitly call for military-backed regime change - something Venezuela's opposition has longed called for.Donald Trump campaigned against regime change in 2016, pledging to \"stop racing to topple foreign regimes\", and more recently has condemned engaging in \"forever wars.\"The US does not recognise Maduro as the president of Venezuela, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed internationally, and by the opposition in Venezuela, as neither free nor fair. The US embassy in Caracas was closed during Trump's first presidency in 2019.The US has upped its bounty for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m, an incentive for those within his loyal, inner circle to hand him in. But it has yielded no defections.Venezuelan law professor and senior associate at the CSIS national security think tank, Jose Ignacio Hernández, says $50m is \"nothing\" for Venezuela's elites.There is a lot of money to be made through corruption within an oil-rich state like Venezuela. The former head of Treasury Alejandro Andrade, made $1bn in bribes before he was convicted.Many analysts agree the Venezuelan military would be key to any regime change, but for them to turn on Maduro and oust him, they would also likely want promises of immunity from prosecution.Mr Hernández adds: \"They will think, in some way or another I am involved in criminal activities too.\"Michael Albertus, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who publishes extensively on Latin America, is not convinced that even a bounty of $500m would persuade Maduro's inner circle to turn him in.\"Authoritarian leaders are always suspicious of even their inner circle, and because of that, they create mechanisms for monitoring them and ensuring loyalty,\" he said.Economic sanctions on Venezuela have exacerbated the already severe economic crisis, but have not succeeded in persuading senior figures to turn against their president.Donald Trump has declared this is a war on narcotics traffickers and said one vessel the US struck, on 16 October, was \"loaded up with mostly fentanyl.\"But fentanyl is primarily produced in Mexico - not South America - and comes into the US over the southern border.\"It isn't about drugs,\" says Dr Sabatini. \"But he's co-opted the Venezuelan opposition's language of how this is not just a dictatorship - it's a criminal regime.\"Since 2020, the US Justice Department has accused President Maduro of leading a drug trafficking and narco-terrorism organisation, which he denies. Trump has said he has authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela in part because of \"drugs coming in\" from Venezuela.Venezuela does not produce large quantities of cocaine - that's mainly Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. There is some cocaine trafficked through Venezuela, which its own government claims it is cracking down on.A US Drug Enforcement Administration report from 2025 says 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia and mentioned other countries but not Venezuela in its cocaine section.The first seven strikes were carried out in the Caribbean, which is not a major sea route for drug-trafficking compared with the Pacific Ocean, where the subsequent strikes were carried out.The US has not detailed its evidence of Maduro leading a drug trafficking organisation. Maduro has repeatedly denied the accusations, and for his part accuses the US of imperialism and worsening the country's economic crisis through sanctions.There are known cases of those close to him being indicted.In 2016, a New York federal court convicted the two nephews of his wife for conspiring to import cocaine to the US. The case said they planned to use some of the money to fund his wife's political campaign. They were later freed.Intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one, according to military analysts.As well as the US ships we tracked around Puerto Rico - where the US has a military base - satellite imagery also showed two vessels about 75 miles (123km) east of Trinidad and Tobago.One was a guided missile cruiser, the USS Lake Erie.The other appeared to be the MV Ocean Trader according to Bradley Martin, a former US Navy captain, now a senior policy researcher at RAND Corp.This is a converted cargo ship designed to support special forces missions while blending in with commercial traffic. It can house drones, helicopters, and small boats.There are a wide variety of missions it could conceivably support, including reconnaissance to prepare for strikes. But Mr Martin stresses that its presence \"doesn't necessarily mean that those kinds of activities are being carried out or are planned\".The US has bolstered its air presence in the region - BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.Stu Ray, a senior analyst at McKenzie Intelligence Services, says a satellite image taken on 17 October shows F-35 fighter jets on the tarmac, possibly F-35Bs.These are highly advanced stealth jets prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability.On social media, a private jet pilot shared a video of a MQ-9 Reaper drone, filmed at Rafael Hernández Airport on Puerto Rico.These have been used by the US to carry out attacks and surveillance in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya and Mali.Earlier in October, BBC Verify tracked three B-52 bombers which flew across the Caribbean and close to Venezuela's coast.The US air force later confirmed that the planes had taken part in a \"bomber attack demonstration\".Flights of B1 bombers and P-8 Poseidon spy planes have also been visible on plane tracking platforms.Images on social media have also shown military helicopters operating off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago.Some of these are Boeing MH-6M Little Birds - nicknamed \"Killer Eggs\" - used by US special forces.When asked if the CIA had been given the authority to take out Maduro, Donald Trump dodged the question and said it would be \"ridiculous\" to answer.He has also said that the US is \"looking at land now\", referring to possible military operations on Venezuelan soil.The CIA is viewed with a lot of suspicion by many in Latin America because of a long history of covert interventions, attempts at regime-change, and support for past right-wing military dictatorships, notably in Chile and Brazil.Ned Price, deputy to the US representative to the United Nations and formerly a CIA senior analyst and State Department senior adviser, said CIA covert action can take \"many forms.\"\"It can be information operations. It can be sabotage operations. It can be funding opposition parties. It can go as far as the overthrow of a regime. There are a lot of options between the low-end and high-end option.\"This could include agents being used to target trafficking suspects inside Venezuela. By the US's own definition, this could include Maduro himself.Dr Sabatini says given Venezuela isn't a major production point for drugs, there are no cocaine or fentanyl labs to \"take out\" but there are airstrips or ports which the US could target.\"If he wants to be aggressive, he could send a missile to a military barrack. There is pretty good intelligence certain sectors of the military are involved in cocaine trafficking.\"Or it could be a \"smash and grab situation\", he notes, where they attempt to seize Maduro or some of his lieutenants and bring them to justice in the US.The big question, he argues, is how long Trump is willing to keep so many US assets parked in the Caribbean.If the prime purpose of this military build-up is to threaten Maduro, it is unclear whether it is enough to prompt defections.Whether that goes as far as an actual attempt to dislodge the Maduro regime through force, ponders Professor Albertus, it is hard to know.Prosecutors said the elaborate plot, which allegedly netted $7m from victims, belonged in a Hollywood film.The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.It will be the first face-to-face meeting for both leaders since Trump's return to office.The ground stop also hit Horizon Air, which is operated by the airline.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Is climate change to blame?","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg924nrgd3o","message":"","news":"Hong Suk-hui was waiting on the shore of South Korea's Jeju Island when the call came. His fishing boat had capsized.Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned.\"When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,\" said Mr Hong.Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats sunk or capsized.\"The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,\" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association.\"Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.\"Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C.Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to \"stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters\".On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.\"I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,\" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. \"The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\"A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.\"Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,\" he said. \"If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.\"Professor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.\"Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,\" he told the BBC.Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.One foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled.As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.\"In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,\" he said. \"But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish.\"This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.\"The haul is basically worthless,\" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.\"The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,\" Park continued. \"I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.\"And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier.Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as \"a vicious and tragic cycle\".When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, \"you have a higher chance of meeting disaster\", she explained.On 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery.One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat.\"It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,\" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. \"Ultimately it is their call when to go out,\" she said.As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. \"Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,\" she said.Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. \"Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.\"The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.Because the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.\"The future looks very bleak,\" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last.\"Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.\"\"These days it's just really tough.\"Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun ChoiA committee of MPs says the government has not demonstrated if economic benefits from airport expansion outweigh climate impacts.Three people are on trial accused of spraying Stonehenge with orange powder.Labour ministers have been criticised for giving less than 8% of a £360m package to Scotland, which lands more than half of the UK's catch .Mark Požlep's new work goes on display inside St Clement's Church as part of the Spill Festival.Jersey's environment panel wants clarity about claims over French scallop import rules.Copyright 2025 BBC.

But their top order could not find the momentum to take on this challenge in the face of some fine bowling, leaving too much for the middle and lower order batters to achieve.In the event, India won by a comfortable margin of 53 runs in front of more than 25,166 spectators, the highest group-stage attendance at a women's ICC tournament.To be fair, fortune had dealt New Zealand a poor hand in the tournament.Two earlier matches were rained off, costing points and disrupting their rhythm. Against a resurgent India, they looked rusty, lagging in skill and energy.As co-hosts with Sri Lanka, India were expected to reach the knockouts. Early emphatic wins, including one over arch-rival Pakistan, signalled their intent to break their World Cup jinx.In the past decade, India have reached two World Cup finals: losing to England in the 2017 ODI and to Australia in the 2020 T20.A strong start this time raised hopes of a title run, but consecutive losses to South Africa, Australia, and England threatened to derail it.All three matches were close. South Africa and Australia won by three wickets each with only a handful of deliveries to spare. England was even narrower, by a mere four runs defending 288.The loss to South Africa stung most. Australia have long been India's nemesis, England evenly matched, but South Africa's win was a shock upset.These close encounters highlighted India's difficulty in sealing victories under pressure - defending against South Africa and chasing against England.Unforced errors leading to dropped catches, indiscreet strokes and poor bowling at crunch moments in these matches saw India repeatedly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.A jittery mindset and propensity to crumble under pressure were seen as major hurdles in India's progress. But the team rediscovered its mojo in time, as the authoritative victory over New Zealand on Thursday night showed.But the biggest hurdles lie ahead.Which teams will square off against each other in the semi-finals would only be known after Friday's match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The other teams in the semi-final are Australia, England and South Africa, all of whom have beaten India in this tournament itself.The hardship quotient for India, therefore, is well-known. What India have learnt from earlier defeats to these teams, and how they will approach the task now remains to be seen.On paper, Australia, ranked number one by ICC, are strong favourites to win, with a star-studded side and an unbeaten record so far in this tournament.England are ranked number two and while not as rich in talent or as ruthlessly ambitious as Australia, have the resources to challenge the best.South Africa's men's team stunned the cricket world by beating Australia in the last World Test Championship final. Ranked number four, the women's team in this ODI World Cup has shown similar desire to beat the odds.Number three ranked India are in the race for supremacy, with experts backing them for a maiden title. Mandhana, the top ODI batter, leads this tournament's run charts.Her opening partner, 25-year-old psychology graduate Pratika Rawal, has grown from playing sparkling cameos to big scores.Rodrigues, who was dropped for a match after a string of low scores, has bounced back magnificently.Captain Harmanpreet Kaur has been somewhat below par, but a smashing half century against England suggested she was returning to her best.Deepti Sharma, Amanjot Kaur, Sneh Rana give the team all-round heft and while Renuka Singh, Kanto Goud and Shree Charani have been extremely effective.

We have a very good relationship, but that will be a big one.\"China's commerce minister Wang Wentao expressed optimism on Friday over the upcoming negotiations with the US.He said past rounds of talks showed that \"it is entirely possible to find solutions to each other's concerns\" and \"promote the healthy, stable and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations\".Trump is also set to meet South Korean leader Lee Jae Myung during his visit, and participate in a working dinner for leaders.It is part of a wider trip that Trump is taking to Asia, which also includes a stop for him at a meeting in Malaysia on Sunday for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit.He will also meet leaders from Malaysia, South Korea and Japan - notably the latter's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Leavitt said.Trump and Xi have spoken at least three times this year, most recently in September, when they discussed a deal over TikTok's operations in the US.They last met in person in 2019, during Trump's first term as president.Trump has said that speaking directly to Xi was the most effective approach to resolving persistent tensions between the US and China, like tariffs, trade disputes, fentanyl trafficking and other issues.The US and China have clung to a fragile trade ceasefire brokered in May, preventing triple-digit tariffs that was threatened between both countries.But in October, China tightened export controls on rare earths - leading Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports. He slammed Beijing in a post on social media, accusing it of trying to hold the world \"captive\" and of becoming \"very hostile\".Trump had then threatened to pull out of the upcoming meeting.China dominates production of rare earths and certain other materials, which are key components in cars, smartphones and many other items.The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.China is emphasising technological self sufficiency and domestic spending while keeping a laser focus on corruption.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.A former White House chief ethics lawyer described the ballroom donations as an ethical \"nightmare\".Plastic recycling plants in Europe are being shut as they struggle to find a business modelCopyright 2025 BBC.

Rozier, arrested in Orlando, will appear there.Both will be arraigned at a later date in Brooklyn.Jones, who retired in 2012, is one of three people to be charged in both cases.“My message to the defendants who have been rounded up today is this: Your winning streak has ended,’’ Nocella said. “Your luck has run out. Violating the law is a losing proposition, and you can bet on that.’’Billups, the Portland head coach since 2021, is charged in an elaborate scheme in which marks were lured to participate in rigged poker games in part with the opportunity to play alongside the NBA five-time All-Star as well as Jones.Billups, Nocella said, knowingly served as the so-called “face card,” to attract the “fish,” to underground games in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and the Hamptons that they had no chance of winning. Those involved in the scheme used rigged card-shuffling machines, poker chip trays and even special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. In some instances, the alleged conspirators used X-ray tables that reveal cards when they are placed face down.Nocella said the scheme, deemed “Zen Diagram” by the feds, “fleeced” victims out of tens of millions of dollars. One alleged victim lost $1.8 million. The money was then laundered by the crime families.“And when people refused to pay, these defendants did what organized crime has always done,’’ New York police commissioner Jessica Tisch said. “They used threats. They used intimidation. And they used violence. It’s the same pattern that we have seen for decades, traditional mob enforcement methods combined with new technology to expand the reach of their operations.’’Rozier, who was arrested in an Orlando hotel, was alleged to participate in a game-fixing scheme that included prop bets on his availability.Investigators allege between December 2022 and March 2024, Rozier tipped people about his availability for games, citing seven specific games in their investigation including one, against the New Orleans Pelicans, already flagged by sportsbooks for irregular activity.In that March 2023 game, Rozier, then with the Charlotte Hornets, left the game after just nine minutes with an injury. According to investigators, Rozier shared that inside information, and his co-conspirator bettors made $200,000 in wagers on the under.“Those bets paid out, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profit,’’ Tisch said. “The proceeds were later delivered to his home, where the group counted their cash.’’That investigation, deemed “Nothing But Net,” also included the previous arrest of former Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter, who was banned from the NBA in 2024 and later admitted to manipulating his performance in two games. He is awaiting sentencing.Nocella said other defendants involved in the case threatened Porter, who had pre-existing gambling debts, in order to get the inside information.“This is the insider trading saga of the NBA,’’ FBI Director Patel said.The NBA has said previously it looked into the game involving Rozier against the Pelicans and that no rules had been broken. He was with the Heat, who opened their season on Wednesday, but did not play due to a coach’s decision.Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, strongly disputed the accusations, saying that prosecutors characterized Rozier as a subject of their investigation and not a target.“But at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel,’’ Trusty said.“They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case. They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.”CNN has reached out to the Trail Blazers and other teams mentioned in the news conference. Attorney information for Billups was not immediately available.In a statement, the NBA said, “We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.”The Heat directed press inquiries to the NBA statement. The Trail Blazers noted that Tiago Splitter will be taking on interim head coaching duties as Billups is on leave.“We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation. Billups has been placed on immediate leave, and Tiago Splitter will assume head coaching duties in the interim. Any further questions should be directed to the NBA,” the Blazers said in a statement.This story has been updated with additional reporting.CNN’s Kara Scannell and Mark Morales contributed reporting to this story.© 2025 Cable News Network.

They only did this to interfere with the decision of the US Supreme Court, and other courts,” Trump wrote.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump added.Earlier on Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said on social media that a TV advertisement created by the government of Ontario in Canada “misrepresents the ‘Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade’ dated April 25, 1987.”The foundation also said that Ontario had not received its permission “to use and edit the remarks” of the late US president.The foundation added that it was “reviewing legal options in this matter” and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan’s address.Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford said earlier this week that the advertisement in question – featuring President Reagan criticising tariffs on foreign goods while saying they caused job losses and trade wars – had caught Trump’s attention.“I heard that the president heard our ad. I’m sure he wasn’t too happy,” Ford said on Tuesday.In an earlier post on social media, Ford posted a link to the advertisement and the message: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada.

The other two siblings were found hours later, alone at the camp.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

And on Friday, Lowell will be beside New York Attorney General Letitia James in Norfolk, Virginia, as she is arraigned on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James has called the charges “baseless.”Lowell has for decades been a moth to the flame of Washington politics and scandal. He built his reputation by getting politicians out of legal trouble or advocating pointedly before television cameras to try to sway public opinion and influence prosecutors’ decision making.Now, at 73, Lowell is one of the most prominent faces defending many of Trump’s perceived enemies in criminal investigations, security clearance revocations, and other matters.“He’s a lawyers’ lawyer in that the politics aren’t what motivates the case,” said Mark Zaid, a high-profile Washington, DC, lawyer who represents whistleblowers. Zaid hired Lowell and other attorneys when the Trump administration revoked his security clearance.  They filed a lawsuit, which is pending, to try to get it restored.NY AG Letitia James to ask for her case to be dismissed due to appointment of Lindsey Halligan“He argues for the rule of law and this administration is subverting the rule of law so much that I wish there was an army of Abbe Lowells who, even if they didn’t have his skill, that they have his desire to uphold the integrity of the system and the principles that this country was founded on,” Zaid said.While Lowell is taking on Trump now, his past clients include Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner when they were questioned as part of the special counsel investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He also defended President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who went to trial and was convicted of gun-related charges. Biden also pleaded guilty to tax crimes. (He was later pardoned.)Earlier this year, Lowell left Winston & Strawn, the large DC law firm where he spent the past seven years, to set up his own firm to represent clients in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. He’s bolstered his team with a cadre of young lawyers.In addition to James, Bolton and Zaid, Lowell is also representing others targeted by Trump, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor and several former FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors who were fired from their positions.Lowell declined to be interviewed. In a statement he said he started his own firm to fill a need.“The catalyst was the Trump administration’s attempts to use the legal system to silence perceived opponents and critics. I have challenged government overreach in every administration since President Reagan, but the scale and scope of Trump’s intrusion required action,” Lowell said in a statement to CNN.Lowell was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised on Long Island where his father was an insurance agent and his mother was a doctor’s assistant. He graduated from Columbia Law School and swiftly made his way to Washington and into politics.He served as counsel to House Democrats during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment proceedings. Soon thereafter Lowell represented California Democratic Rep. Gary Condit during the disappearance of intern Chandra Levy in 2001. Condit was interviewed by the police amid reports of a romantic relationship with her. He declined to speak to the media, while Lowell frequently sparred with journalists on TV. Condit was never charged with any wrongdoing.Former Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. John Edwards hired Lowell when he went on trial on campaign finance charges. The trial dominated the headlines. Edwards was acquitted of one charge and the jury deadlocked on others.“In these politically charged cases you have to wear two hats. You have to be traditionally good in court … but then you also have to have some sophistication about the way Washington works. Abbe wears both,” said Reid Weingarten, a Washington criminal defense lawyer and long-time friend of Lowell’s. “I think the Edwards trial sent him on the path to become a defense attorney trial guy.”Weingarten encountered Lowell decades earlier when he was a prosecutor investigating a Tennessee lawmaker who Lowell represented.“Each thing he handled he took incredibly seriously like there was nothing more important than this particular matter, this client, this cross examination. It accounts for much of his success,” said Weingarten. “He devotes his all to it and Abbe’s all is way more than most.” (The lawmaker was not charged with any wrongdoing.)New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez turned to Lowell when he faced bribery charges in 2017. Then, a Newark jury failed to reach a verdict and a federal judge later acquitted Menendez on some charges. (Menendez was convicted in 2024 on different bribery charges in New York. Lowell did not represent him at trial).Lowell also represented Matthew Grimes, a former assistant to Trump donor and loyalist Tom Barrack. Barrack, who is now US ambassador to Turkey, and Grimes were both acquitted of federal charges of acting as foreign agents.During the trial, Lowell fumbled with his microphone as he spoke with the jury and read aloud text messages, translating emojis as “smiley face,” that Grimes sent to an overseas counterpart who was part of the alleged scheme.One person involved in the case, who did not want to be identified, said Lowell’s actions appeared to disarm his client to the jury and turned the allegedly criminal exchanges into seemingly benign chats between young men looking to impress each other.“He understands all the intangibles that go into presenting to a jury that’s different from the facts and the law. Those are the things that make him a very good lawyer,” said one lawyer who has opposed him.“Outside of the courtroom, generally, he’s a tough guy. He’s no holds-barred – a lot of posturing, a lot of self-righteousness. It worked for him,” the person said.Lowell’s posturing and what some lawyers describe as brash manner aren’t without controversy.He took over Hunter Biden’s representation after a plea deal to end the criminal investigation blew up spectacularly during a court hearing, ending any potential for the case to be resolved before his father’s re-election campaign.Lowell shifted the strategy to a more aggressive public posture, sparring with Republicans on the hill and teeing the case for trial.During the trial, lurid details of Hunter Biden’s drug use and sex life spilled into the public in the middle of Biden’s re-election campaign.During opening arguments, Lowell leaned into Biden’s drug use as something millions of Americans deal with. At one point while Lowell was speaking, one juror appeared to become emotional, reaching for tissues in her bag and dabbed her eyes and her nose several times.Lowell used the same direct manner in representing James, writing pointed letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Ed Martin, who was named special attorney for mortgage fraud at the Justice Department.In August, Martin criticized Lowell’s tactics, writing in a private letter, “Because of your reputation for using the media to argue your points, I prefer that we communicate by letter. I find leaks like your Bondi letter professionally unacceptable and personally insulting. To that end, I specifically ask that you redouble your efforts to not leak this confidential letter.”Six days later, Lowell replied.“You cannot unilaterally conduct a media campaign to prejudice and intimidate my client and expect there will be no similar public response,” Lowell wrote. “And, whenever you do bring your threatened action, please explain to the judges before whom you file all that you have been saying and doing.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James is due to be arraigned in Virginia.And CNN reported Thursday that Ed Martin, one of the most polarizing Trump Justice Department officials, has been pushing for the investigation into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff’s alleged mortgage fraud to lead to an indictment, despite prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office being hesitant to proceed with charges.Trump declined to weigh in on a possible Schiff indictment on Thursday, saying, “I hope it’s true, but I don’t know anything.”As the administration has targeted the president’s enemies, the big question has been whether Americans would see it as just some political tit-for-tat equivalent to the indictments of Trump, or whether they’d recognize it as an extraordinary weaponization of the justice system.The early verdict is in.Americans seem to see charges the Trump administration has brought against its enemies as significantly less serious and significantly more politicized than the indictments of Trump.A Quinnipiac University poll this week showed voters agreed 52%-38% that Trump was “using the U.S. Justice Department to file unjustified criminal charges against his political opponents.”Independents agreed with that sentiment by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58%-31%.A Reuters-Ipsos poll, meanwhile, showed Americans said 55%-26% that Trump was using federal law enforcement to go after his enemies. Even 29% of Republicans agreed with this.(The question, unlike the Quinnipiac poll, didn’t ask people to judge the legitimacy of the charges.)The polls would seem to be in line with a late September survey from the Pew Research Center.That poll was conducted shortly after Trump removed a US attorney who resisted bringing charges against James and issued a public call for Attorney General Pam Bondi to bring them against Comey and James. Comey’s indictment landed soon after, which fell in the middle of the poll’s survey period.Pew showed 62% of Americans agreed Trump was at least “probably” improperly encouraging federal investigations of his political opponents. Even 40% of Republican-leaning Americans said Trump was probably doing this.These are pretty striking numbers that suggest a potential political problem for Trump, even as he moves forward.And perhaps most notably, the numbers suggest Americans see the situation as quite different from Trump’s indictments.The president baselessly accused then-President Joe Biden and a “weaponized” Justice Department of being behind the charges against him. (In fact, there is much more to tie Trump to orchestrating the Comey and James indictments.)Analysts have generally regarded the recent classified documents charges against a third Trump foe, former national security adviser John Bolton, as being more substantial. The case originated in the Biden administration, and Trump didn’t publicly push it like he did the James and Comey cases – or fire a prosecutor.But Americans seem to see the charges against Trump as simply more serious than the overall charges his administration has brought against his enemies.While just 38% of voters in the Quinnipiac poll said the charges against Trump’s opponents were justified, Americans generally said by clear, double-digit margins that the cases against Trump were legitimate – and even that he was guilty. (Trump pleaded not guilty in all cases against him.)Americans said 56%-41% that the investigations against Trump were “fair” rather than a “witch hunt,” according to a March 2023 Marist College poll conducted shortly before his  first indictment.And they said 47%-31% that the charges owed to Trump’s own actions, rather than an “abuse of the justice system,” according to an August 2023 CNN poll.Americans said 57%-41% that the Justice Department was holding Trump accountable like anyone else, rather than that DOJ was “unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons,” according to a December 2023 Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.And they said 58%-37% that there was “credible evidence” that Trump committed serious federal crimes, according to an August 2023 Public Religion Research Institute poll.Near-majorities of Americans saw political motivations in many of the cases. And even more saw that in the Manhattan hush money case in which Trump was eventually convicted.But that didn’t mean Americans saw those cases as illegitimate “witch hunts” or “hoaxes,” as Trump claims they were.Indeed, Americans seem much more inclined to believe that about the cases Trump is orchestrating against his foes.© 2025 Cable News Network.

test","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/as-trump-makes-rare-visit-to-malaysia-pm-anwars-balancing-act-faces-test","message":"","news":"US president’s visit to Malaysia puts spotlight on Southeast Asian country’s efforts to walk a fine line between great powers.By John PowerShareSaveKuala Lumpur, Malaysia – When US President Donald Trump lands in Malaysia for Southeast Asia’s headline summit this weekend, he will be delivering Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim a diplomatic coup.US presidents rarely visit Malaysia, a multiracial nation of 35 million people sandwiched between Thailand and Singapore, which for decades has maintained a policy of not picking sides in rivalries between great powers.Trump is just the third US leader to travel to the Southeast Asian country, which is hosting a Sunday-to-Tuesday summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), following visits by former US Presidents Barack Obama and Lyndon B Johnson.After skipping ASEAN summits in 2018, 2019 and 2020, Trump, whose disdain for multilateralism is renowned, will be attending the gathering of Southeast Asian nations for just the second time.The US president will be joined by a host of high-profile leaders from non-ASEAN countries, including Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.Opting not to attend are Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who Trump is expected to meet in South Korea at next week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.Trump’s visit, in many ways, is emblematic of the delicate balancing act that Anwar’s government has sought to maintain as Malaysia navigates the headwinds of the heated rivalry between the US and China.Malaysia is deeply entwined with both the US and Chinese economies.The US, which has a large footprint in Malaysia’s tech and oil and gas industries, was the Southeast Asian country’s top foreign investor and third-biggest trading partner in 2024.China, a major purchaser of Malaysian electronics and palm oil, the same year took the top spot in trade and was third for investment.But Malaysia’s efforts to walk a fine line between Washington and Beijing have become increasingly fraught as the superpowers roll out tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls while butting heads over regional flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.“Optimally, Malaysia wants to productively engage both China and the US on a variety of issues,” said Thomas Daniel, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Kuala Lumpur.“It is in our interest,” Daniel told Al Jazeera.Anwar has cast Trump’s visit as a chance to bolster economic ties, champion regional peace and stability, and elevate ASEAN’s standing on the international stage.Anwar has also pledged to use the rare opportunity for face time with Trump to constructively raise points of difference between Washington and Kuala Lumpur, particularly the Palestinian cause.“The through-line is autonomy: avoid entanglement, maximise options, and extract benefits from both poles without becoming anyone’s proxy,” Awang Azman Awang Pawi, a professor at the University of Malaya, told Al Jazeera.During Trump’s visit, US tariffs on Malaysia, currently set at 19 percent, and China’s mooted export controls on rare earths are expected to be high on the agenda.For Malaysia, the priority is preserving “rules-based” trade that allows for countries to deepen economic ties despite their political differences, said Mohd Ramlan Mohd Arshad, a senior lecturer at the MARA University of Technology in Shah Alam, near Kuala Lumpur.A prolonged economic cold war between the US and China is the “worst thing” that could happen to Malaysia, Arshad told Al Jazeera.Trump, who has made no secret of his ambitions for the Nobel Peace Prize, is also expected to witness the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, which engaged in a brief border conflict in July that left at least 38 people dead.For Anwar, who has led a multiracial coalition of parties with diverse and competing interests since 2022, the balancing act also involves political considerations at home.US support for Israel’s war in Gaza has been a bone of contention in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where the plight of Palestinians has inspired frequent public protests.In the run-up to the summit, critics have demanded that Anwar rescind Trump’s invitation over his role in supporting the war, which a United Nations commission of inquiry last month determined to constitute genocide.“A person like Trump, no matter how powerful, should not be welcomed in Malaysia,” former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar’s former mentor-turned-nemesis, said in a video message last month.Defending the invitation, Anwar has stressed his view of diplomacy as “practical work” for advancing his country’s interests “in an imperfect world”.“It demands balance, discipline, and the courage to stay the course even when the ground shifts beneath us,” he told a conference in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.As a small power, Malaysia has always put pragmatism at the centre of its foreign policy, said Sharifah Munirah Alatas, an independent scholar and researcher who previously taught international relations at the National University of Malaysia.“Anwar and Malaysia cannot afford to do otherwise,” Alatas told Al Jazeera.“And given the current highly unpredictable Sino-American tension induced by the Trump 2.0 era, ASEAN will remain actively non-aligned, without taking sides.”Awang Azman, the University of Malaya professor, said that while Trump’s visit will elevate Malaysia and ASEAN’s profile by itself, the true test of the summit’s success will be tangible outcomes on issues such as the Thailand-Cambodia conflict and trade.“It’s not just a photo op if a ceasefire accord and concrete trade language land on paper,” Awang Azman said.“If either track stalls, the visit is still symbolically significant – given the rarity of US presidential trips to Malaysia – but the narrative will revert to optics over outcomes.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"NYC mayoral candidates clash over Trump and political

Scientists are now starting to unravel how it affects the brain.On Charlie Drury's eighth birthday, his life changed forever.It was November 2012 and the day had all the usual birthday fun – cake, presents and themed party food. But as the day wore on, Charlie's mother, Kate Drury, noticed something strange about her son's behaviour. It started with an eye twitch and then he kept sniffing his hands. Later in the day, he developed a fever. Drury took him to an urgent care clinic near the family's home in Illinois, US, where he was diagnosed with Streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as strep throat.In the weeks that followed, Charlie's health deteriorated in ways that baffled Drury. He became so sensitive to smells that Drury had to stop cooking in the house. He developed extreme separation anxiety, yet his own mother's touch caused him to scream and scrub vigorously at the spot where their skin had met. He barely slept, became anorexic and refused to bathe. He hurled objects around their home. He hallucinated. He struggled to read and write. Drury barely recognised her son, who had previously been a promising student and athlete with no behavioural issues.\"I lost my child in a day,\" Drury says.After more than a month of agony and confusion, physicians diagnosed Charlie with a little-known condition called \"paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections\", or Pandas.Children with Pandas experience a stark and sudden onset of tics and/or signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with symptoms often appearing seemingly overnight. Just as suddenly, a child with Pandas may develop a litany of other issues including regressions in developmental or motor skills, aggressive and erratic behaviour, mood swings, pain, irritability and sleep disturbances, among others.The condition's exact prevalence is hard to pin down, but experts agree Pandas is not common. One estimate says one in every 11,800 children might develop Pandas or a related condition called paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (Pans) in a year, although the numbers do vary dramatically from study to study. They do, however, seem to be more prevalent among boys than girls, according to data from an international patient registry, and strikes children before puberty.\"For obvious reasons, parents are completely terrified\" when these issues emerge, says Shannon Delaney, a child and adolescent neuropsychiatrist in private practice who treats patients with the condition in New York City, US. \"I frequently hear them describe it as, 'It feels like my kid is not there. It feels like they're possessed'.\"Researchers from the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) first described Pandas in the 1990s. Even at that time, the idea that streptococcal infections could cause neurological complications was not new. Doctors in 1894 had described patients with a neurological condition called Sydenham chorea after developing throat infections. Around 100 years later, a group led by Susan Swedo, then chief of the paediatrics and developmental neuroscience branch at NIH, published evidence that suggested strep infections were also linked to the startling and abrupt appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms that are typical in Pandas patients.How could strep throat – a routine illness contracted by hundreds of millions of children around the world each year – cause such an intense response among a small subset of kids?This has been the subject of active scientific debate in the years that have followed. But Swedo, who is now chief science officer at the Pandas Physicians Network in the US, sums it up like this: \"The wrong strep, in an unlucky child… leads to a misdirected immune response.\"In other words, some children's immune systems – perhaps those with a genetic susceptibility – seem to misfire when trying to fight off a strep infection, producing antibodies that attack the body's own healthy tissues. These antibodies seem to get inside the brain and wreak havoc. Studies in animals suggest this may occur in some cases because immune cells produced in response to strep travel along nerves that run from the nose to the brain and weaken the brain's protective barrier.Some scientists continue to question this hypothesis. But multiple research teams have published studies pointing to inflammation and other changes in the brains of children with Pandas – specifically in the basal ganglia, which plays a role in motor control, learning, decision-making and emotional responses. OCD has also been linked to dysfunction in the basal ganglia.Jennifer Frankovich, a paediatric rheumatologist who directs the Stanford Immune-Behavioral Health Program in the US and whose team has produced some of the research on Pandas-related brain inflammation, says such findings are important because they indicate \"this is a real disorder\" caused by an autoimmune response, rather than a psychological condition.For parents struggling with a child whose behaviour has suddenly and dramatically changed, that revelation alone can be valuable, particularly as there can be a tendency to blame it on poor parenting, says Frankovich.Other common respiratory illnesses, including influenza, have been linked to Pandas-like symptoms, too. Preliminary research also suggests Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can either worsen existing symptoms or cause new ones – perhaps by increasing inflammation throughout the body and/or reactivating other dormant viruses in the body, one 2023 study theorised. Delaney's research and clinical experience suggests that tick-borne infections that cause Lyme disease may be a catalyst for symptoms, too.When a pathogen other than strep seems to trigger sudden-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms – or when doctors can't identify a specific trigger – children are given the more general diagnosis of Pans. Although there are other differences in their diagnostic criteria, Pandas is considered a subtype of Pans.Infections can prove disastrous for Pans/Pandas patients for years on end, says Sarah O'Dor, a clinical psychologist at Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts, who until recently was the director of research for the Pediatric Neuropsychiatry and Immunology Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pans/Pandas symptoms wax and wane, with children experiencing periods of near or total remission that can last years. But then, \"if the child gets sick again with something – it might be strep, it might be Covid – suddenly these symptoms come back,\" O'Dor says.Finding treatments for those symptoms, either when they first emerge or when they flare, can be an odyssey for patients and their families. Few clinicians specialise in Pans/Pandas, and some refuse to treat it or argue it doesn't exist at all. A study of children in the International Pans Registry found that 87% struggled to access appropriate care, for reasons including lack of experienced healthcare providers and difficulty securing insurance coverage.When a child is taken for treatment, clinicians may see psychiatric symptoms and automatically prescribe psychiatric drugs. These medications can help in some cases, but they can also hurt – research suggests many Pans/Pandas patients are prone to side-effects even at relatively low doses. Others simply don't respond to them. Most patients need a \"multi-pronged approach\" that also addresses the infection that caused their initial or flaring symptoms and the immune effects thought to stem from that infection, O'Dor says.If treatment starts early, routine medications like antibiotics, steroids, and even over-the-counter painkillers can make a world of difference, says Frankovich, who helped draft clinical guidelines for treating Pans/Pandas.But when Pans/Pandas goes untreated for a long time or is particularly severe, patients may need more intensive and invasive therapies, like intravenous immunoglobulin (infusions of donated antibodies, often abbreviated to IVIG) or plasma exchange therapy (a procedure that removes and replaces tainted plasma in a patient's blood), according to these clinical guidelines.In 1999, Swedo published research suggesting that IVIG and plasma exchange therapy are effective against Pandas symptoms. Nearly 30 years later, \"it's ridiculous that children are not getting help\", she says.But the science on Pans/Pandas treatment isn't entirely settled. A small 2016 study that Swedo co-authored did not find a statistically significant difference between IVIG treatment and a placebo. Two years later, a European research review concluded that more rigorous research on treatment is needed.Nonetheless, many patients swear by the results provided by treatments like IVIG. When Drury's son developed Pandas more than a decade ago, she was willing to pay thousands of dollars for his first IVIG treatment – which, she says, \"brought him back to us\". The experience prompted her to become an advocate, pushing for a state law that requires insurers to cover treatments including IVIG for Pans/Pandas patients.\"Charlie's Law\" passed in Illinois in 2017 – but to this day, Drury says, it can be a struggle to get the right treatments for her son, who is now 20. Charlie has had long periods of remission, but also multiple severe flare ups. Clinicians have told him he will need regular IVIG infusions, as well as plasma exchange therapy, for the rest of his life, says Drury.\"We'd be in these hospitals and they're like, 'We can't help you',\" Drury says. \"Even though there's a law in his name.\"Pans and Pandas are today recognised by global health authorities – the World Health Organization has added Pandas to its disease classification system, for example – and researchers and patient support groups across the world are working to improve quality of care and access to it. In the UK, Pans and Pandas were the subject of a 2023 parliamentary hearing.But skepticism still remains in some areas. In a 2025 report, the American Academy of Pediatrics described Pans as \"likely\" to be a valid diagnosis, but added that \"the diagnostic process is challenged by a lack of well-accepted evidence to guide the clinician\" and that \"much remains unknown about the condition\".It's true that there is no single test that can diagnose Pans or Pandas, nor a biomarker that definitively signals their presence. Brain changes associated with these conditions are also so subtle that they don't show up to the naked eye on imaging tests, Frankovich says. \"When the radiologist reads the MRI, they're looking with their eyeballs and they're like, 'Oh, this is a normal brain',\" Frankovich says. \"So these poor patients are getting dismissed.\"Researchers continue to study Pans/Pandas, hoping to learn more about why they happen, what goes on in the bodies of patients who have these conditions, and whether there are biomarkers that could enable easier diagnosis and open the door to new treatments. One is Brent Harris, a neuropathologist at Georgetown University in Washington DC, US, who oversees the Pandas/Pans and Other Neuroimmune Disorders Brain Bank.The brain bank fills an important research gap. Studying the brains of Pans/Pandas patients who have died allows for more granular analysis than doctors could perform when they were alive, he says. Through this work, Harris and his colleagues have found additional evidence of inflammation in the basal ganglia and other parts of the brain. Harris hopes such discoveries could eventually provide new targets for treatment.Still, Harris stresses that far more research is required. His laboratory, for example, is working with only nine donated brains, and a much larger number would be needed to make generalisations about these diseases.One of those donors is Alissa Johnson, who lives in New Jersey, US. Her daughter, Louisa \"Lulu\" Johnson, died in 2021 after \"two and a half years of unbelievable pain and suffering\" brought on by Pandas, made worse by \"lack of awareness\" and \"difficulty accessing care\", Johnson says.Lulu's Pandas symptoms began just after New Year's Day in 2019, when she was 11. \"We came home [from a trip] on the first,\" Johnson remembers. \"On the second, it was like she woke up in a totally different body.\"Johnson's previously \"happy, healthy, and thriving child\" suddenly had no appetite and severe gastrointestinal distress, struggled to sleep and acted in strange, frightening ways – including trying to climb out of a moving car.Lulu was hospitalised multiple times over the winter and spring that followed, testing positive for strep in February 2019. Still, it took months for the family to receive a Pandas diagnosis, a lull during which Lulu was given drugs that didn't help, including psychiatric medications that triggered bad reactions.Even once a Pandas diagnosis came, Johnson says, getting proper treatment was not easy. \"Our paediatrician's office wanted nothing to do with us following the diagnosis,\" Johnson says. And one emergency room visit, during which Johnson refused to admit her daughter to a psychiatric institution, resulted in a call to Child Protective Services, she says.Eventually, Lulu was treated with immune-system-altering drugs, including IVIG, that led to steady improvement. But after a string of medication changes, her condition deteriorated until her death in 2021.\"Her dream was to become an immunologist and help patients like her,\" Johnson says. Since her passing, Lulu's parents have tried to honour that dream in other ways. They founded the Louisa Adelynn Johnson Fund for Complex Disease to raise awareness for and fund research on neuroimmune conditions. And they have posthumously donated Lulu's blood and brain tissue to Georgetown's brain bank, while allowing her test results to be used in other studies.It is a cold kind of comfort, Johnson says. \"It's really sad,\" she says, \"to have people acknowledge how sick she was only after she's dead.\"But as scientists slowly unravel the mystery of Pandas, they inch closer to realising Lulu's dream: sparing other children from lives upended by what should otherwise be a simple throat infection.--For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.Rollercoasters send our hearts racing and stomachs dropping.

They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand.In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25m) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Costra Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones.FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities.Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds.The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise.Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing.Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege.Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment.Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.The technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands.Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say.Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege.Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\".That person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win.Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies.A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise.\"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.The ground stop also hit Horizon Air, which is operated by the airline.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.The programme helps 40 million low-income Americans afford groceries - but the government shutdown has funds running dry.Copyright 2025 BBC.

US pressure comes to bear on Israel","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/analysis-americas-51st-state-us-pressure-comes-to-bear-on-israel","message":"","news":"The US and Israel have long been close allies, but is Washington now emphasising its dominance?By Simon Speakman CordallShareSaveA succession of high-ranking US officials have found themselves in Israel in recent days – first special envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner on Monday, then Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday.Their focus has been clear – to stop the US-backed Gaza ceasefire deal from collapsing. And that essentially means ensuring that the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not back out of the agreement, which ended two years of war earlier this month.The presence of the US officials in Israel has been described as “babysitting” – designed to twist the arm of a far-right government itching to find any excuse to relaunch the war, which killed more than 68,000 Palestinians.And so far, the administration of US President Donald Trump appears to have largely succeeded, highlighting what some analysts deem to be Israeli subservience to the US, and an acknowledgment that when Washington orders Israel to do something, the latter will ultimately agree.“Of course, Israel is a client state of the US,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli ambassador and consul general in New York, told Al Jazeera. Pinkas referred to the billions of dollars Israel receives from the US in aid, the dozens of times Washington uses its veto to protect Israel from criticism or sanction at the United Nations, and its military protection of Israel.Now the Trump administration is leveraging that support and doing what is a rare occurrence when it comes to relations between the two countries: forcing Israel to act according to the US’s wishes, and making public Washington’s pressure on Israel.Some of that has come from Trump himself – in an interview published by Time Magazine on Thursday, the US president said that he had stopped Netanyahu from continuing the Gaza war. “You know, I stopped him, because he would have just kept going,” Trump said. “It could have gone on for years.”Trump also made it clear in the same interview that Israel would lose “all support” from the US if it proceeded with the annexation of the occupied West Bank, which its parliament or Knesset preliminarily approved on Wednesday. Vance also voiced his opposition to an Israeli parliamentary vote on annexation, calling it “very stupid”.Netanyahu understood the message, and his office called the vote a “political provocation” – even as members of his own government voted in favour, and even though he himself has previously backed annexation.The US has always been the stronger party in the relationship with Israel. It is the global superpower, while Israel is an ally with a traditionally large constituency of support within the US.But US governments, for whatever reason, have often tried to avoid any direct confrontation with Israel. Former US President Joe Biden adopted a “bear hug” policy towards Israel during the first three months of the war on Gaza, arguing that the Israelis needed to be publicly backed in order to convince them to avoid going too far in their destruction of the Palestinian enclave.That did not work, with Netanyahu repeatedly ignoring attempts to get him to agree to a ceasefire. Instead, it was Trump, who is incredibly popular in Israel for the support he gave the country in his first term, who has taken the relatively more confrontational route with Israel since his return to the presidency. So far, it appears to be working.“Benjamin Netanyahu has been put on notice,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera. “The US team can say all these different things –  as they are doing –  but it’s pretty obvious what their agenda is.“Look at the 60 Minutes interview [US presidential adviser Jared] Kushner and [US special envoy Steve] Witkoff gave where they spoke of betrayal and a loss of control. To my mind, this contradicts all the shows of friendliness we’re seeing in the Israeli press. This is the Trump administration coming over and saying quite clearly: ‘You do as you’re told.'”Mekelberg was referring to an interview aired by CBS News last week, in which Witkoff described both himself and Kushner as feeling “a little bit betrayed” by Israel’s decision to strike at the Hamas negotiating team in Doha, Qatar in September. Continuing, Kushner emphasised how Trump, his father-in-law, had felt the Israelis “were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests”.That may go to the root of explaining how Trump, despite his clear support for Israel and his past disparagement of the Palestinians, has been so vocal in criticising Israeli actions. The framing from his administration is that Trump’s restraint of Israel is in the latter’s benefit, highlighting the primacy of the US in the relationship, while also emphasising the bond between the US and Israel.“The relationship between the US and Israel is a central part of both countries’ policies,” said Mitchell Barak, a former aide to Netanyahu. “It’s built on a shared sense of Judeo-Christian values, but Israel is also a valuable strategic partner to the US; it’s also vital in its regional policy as well as providing advances in innovation.”“And what’s more – as we’re seeing from both US business, as well as the Trump family business, who are heavily invested in the region – stability and peace are profitable for all.”“It’s true that Israel’s lost some of its independence in this, but there’s nothing new in that,” Barak added. “I think that’s what we’re seeing right now in the way the US is managing the ceasefire. It’s a combination of carrot and stick and right now, with Vance and the others over, is a reminder of the stick.”And as for the carrot, Trump can focus on what he believes Netanyahu wants – political success, and an end to the prime minister’s legal troubles.Speaking at the Knesset to mark the ceasefire in early October, Trump called upon Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu in the multiple corruption cases he has faced since 2019.“Trump can do that,” Mekelberg said. “He can say to Netanyahu, look, I’ll come over. I’ll talk to the Knesset, I can even ask for you to be pardoned, but in return, you follow the script.”Suggestions that Israel has lost much of its independence in its dealings with the US have appeared to rankle Netanyahu.‘‘I want to put it very clearly. One week, they say that Israel controls the United States. A week later, they say the United States controls Israel. This is hogwash,” said the prime minister, in response to a question about Israel being beholden to the US.Irrespective of Netanyahu’s protestations about US control of Israel, much of the evidence contradicts him. In addition to the current US diplomatic blitz, intended to ensure that Netanyahu carries through with the ceasefire, there are other instances of the Trump administration determining Israeli policy.The ceasefire itself was announced during Netanyahu’s last visit to Washington, seen as a tactic by some observers intended to have the prime minister commit to its terms publicly before returning to Israel.Similarly, during the same visit, Netanyahu found himself being shepherded into issuing a formal apology to the Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for the strike on Doha. And critically, during the conclusion of Israel’s 12-day war on Iran in June, it was Trump who ordered Netanyahu to stop a planned Israeli strike after the start of the ceasefire.For observers such as Pinkas, these actions have been a pointed reminder to Netanyahu and others of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship between Israel and the US, not least under the Trump administration.“They’re [also] delineating Israel’s freedom of movement,” Pinkas said. “They’re letting Netanyahu and others know that they’re free to go so far without consultation, but that’s it.“[And] they’re reminding Netanyahu that he’s essentially out of options in the US. The Democrats can’t stand him, public opinion has turned against him, and there are many in the Republican Party, and specifically the MAGA [Make America Great Again] wing, who are asking questions about him. He can no longer play one side against the other. This is it.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Alaska Airlines flights grounded across US due to IT outage","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjdlz41d65o","message":"","news":"Alaska Airlines grounded flights at all US airports on Thursday due to a technical issue.The US carrier said in a statement that it was \"experiencing an IT outage affecting operations\" and issued \"a temporary ground stop\".The airline did not say how long the outage would last or how many flights were affected.

Full donor list revealed","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891yxgj44ko","message":"","news":"A full list revealing the wealthy donors and corporations paying for US President Donald Trump's new $300m(£225m) White House ballroom has been released by the Trump administration.Groundbreaking for the ornate 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) project began on Monday, with excavators and construction workers tearing out portions of the East Wing.The list includes dozens of companies, such as Amazon, Google and Meta, and several billionaire investors. The US president has said that he personally will pay for significant portions of its construction.The funding model has sparked concern among some legal experts, who say it may amount to paying for access to the administration.\"I view this enormous ballroom as an ethics nightmare,\" Richard Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House between 2005 and 2007, told the BBC.\"It's using access to the White House to raise money. I don't like it,\" he added. \"These corporations all want something from the government.\"Some donors on the list attended a dinner at the White House on 15 October. They include Microsoft, Coinbase, Palantir, Lockheed Martin, Amazon and Google.Also present and on the list was Shari and Edward Glazer, who, together with their siblings, own both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United.The list also includes:A pledge form seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, suggested that donors could be eligible for \"recognition\" for their contributions. While plans are still being finalised, that recognition could potentially take the form of names etched into the structure.The White House had originally said that the gigantic structure would have a seated capacity of 650 people. This week, Trump said that it will be able to hold 999.Court documents show that YouTube will pay $22m towards the project as part of a settlement with Trump regarding a lawsuit over the suspension of his account following the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.But it is unclear how many of the rest of those in attendance may have pledged to donate, or how much.Documents obtained by CBS indicate the donations will be handled by the Trust for the National Mall, a non-profit that works with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House.At the event for potential donors, Trump said many of the attendees had been \"really, really generous\" and said that some had asked whether $25m was an appropriate donation.\"I said: I will take it,\" Trump remarked.The White House has insisted there was nothing inappropriate about soliciting donations and that the ballroom will be used by future administrations. The renovation will not cost US taxpayers a cent, it has said.Martin Mongiello, a former White House executive chef and Camp David general manager who has worked under seven administrations, told the BBC that the money paid to the ballroom \"will eventually pay for itself and save costs\".The tents sometimes set outside for events - which he described as \"elbow to elbow\" and \"embarrassing\", often cost $1m or more, not including other ancillary costs associated with having large-scale events.But Mr Painter suggested it could be considered a \"pay-to-play scheme\", which has dogged previous White House administrations of both political parties.In the 1990s, for example, then-President Bill Clinton came under scrutiny for allegedly selling overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom in exchange for campaign contributions.More recently, Trump sought corporate sponsors for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll in April, which some said could amount to companies vying for the president's attention.Trump and administration officials have said that the new ballroom was a necessary renovation given the lack of large existing facilities to hold state dinners and other events. The White House often uses a tent on the South Lawn to fete foreign leaders and a larger guest list for a state dinner.But the scale of the new ballroom, Mr Painter added, poses an \"enormous temptation\" to use the facility for political fundraising that was not the case before, even if presidents from both parties have invited supporters to events.\"The limited space [now] means that not everyone gets a White House invitation,\" he said. \"In my view, that's a good thing... The [current] size limits the 'pay to play' game, at least on White House premises.\"Proving any wrongdoing, however, is unlikely.\"You can't prove a quid pro quo,\" Mr Painter said. \"But I think the Trump administration is pushing the envelope here.\"Prosecutors said the elaborate plot, which allegedly netted $7m from victims, belonged in a Hollywood film.The US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.It follows a sweeping FBI investigation into illegal sports betting and rigged, mafia-linked poker games.It will be the first face-to-face meeting for both leaders since Trump's return to office.The ground stop also hit Horizon Air, which is operated by the airline.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Many foreign political parties envy us for this,” Jiang Jinquan, an official with the Communist Party Central Committee’s Policy Research Office, said at a press briefing Friday, adding that such plans were essential for “gaining strategic initiative in the midst of intense international competition.”A commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily published Thursday praised how China “views the whole country as one chessboard… and continues to advance steadily along the correct direction,” while “some countries remain trapped in the shortsightedness and constant policy reversals under multiparty systems.”“Long-termism,” a blend of continuity and flexibility, is something “Western countries find difficult to match,” another article, in state media agency Xinhua, quoted Tsinghua University professor Yan Yilong as saying.A separate commentary published by Beijing Daily, meanwhile, spotlighted the “out of control” situation in the US, pointing to the “No Kings” protests, the government shutdown, and a controversial AI-generated video meme shared by US President Donald Trump last weekend.It concluded: “The (American) halo is illusory, and the myth is fragile. To use Trump’s own words: The United States has become a failed state in many ways and is ‘dying from within.’”Such rhetoric is, of course, not unusual within China’s tightly controlled propaganda environment. And officials have long looked to play up the ills of other countries, especially the US, to boost their own image for domestic and, increasingly, international audiences.But the sentiment also reflects the thinking of the country’s ruling Communist Party – and its leader Xi – at a moment when the two countries are sparring over tech and trade as they grapple with how to structure their economic relationship and rivalry.And the chance to amplify that sentiment, through the pomp of crafting the upcoming five-year plan, couldn’t come at a better moment for Xi, days ahead of a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea, and weeks after China reignited US ire by expanding its rare earths export control regime.Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not be released until after its approval by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March. But an overview of the priorities approved by a powerful Communist Party committee that met over four days this week exuded confidence in China’s continued rise.“We will strive for another five years to achieve a significant leap forward in our country’s economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength, comprehensive national power, and international influence by 2035,” a communique released by state media Thursday said.Officials would “accelerate the development of building China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”Leaders signaled they would stay the course on “accelerating high-level scientific and technological self-reliance” and infusing high tech into industry – building on China’s current efforts to upgrade its manufacturing and capacity to innovate.“The proposals advocate for a forward-looking layout for future industries, promoting quantum technology, biotechnology, hydrogen energy, nuclear fusion, brain-computer interfaces, embodied intelligence, and sixth-generation mobile communications as new drivers of economic growth,” Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Friday.The signaling following the meeting in Beijing suggested China would double down on its position as a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse, despite longstanding views from some analysts that it should transition to a services-driven economy as many developed economies have. The communique also stressed the importance of national security and the need to “accelerate the building of advanced combat capabilities” for the military.Officials pointed to efforts to address challenges like flagging domestic consumption, socioeconomic inequality and “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. China would “vigorously boost consumption” and “improve the social security system,” as well as further opening China’s market to international players, according to the communique.How officials precisely plan to achieve these goals will only become clearer over the coming months and years.Observers have long noted the ability of China’s tightly controlled system to achieve far-reaching goals.The country has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, transformed into the world’s second-largest economy and a global growth engine, and more recently emerged as a technological powerhouse and a proponent of the green transition across the world.And as the US shakes up its own foreign and domestic policy under Trump, Beijing is also touting China’s planning as proof that it, not the US, is a responsible global leader.“In today’s global environment, some major powers frequently change their policies, and such ‘unpredictability’ has cast a shadow over world peace and development,” an editorial in state-backed tabloid Global Times published Friday said.“The development roadmap unveiled in the communique for China’s next five years offers the world something truly rare in these turbulent times – certainty,” it added.Chinese electric cars are going global. A cut-throat price war at home could kill off many of its brandsUnlike in Western democracies, where visions for a country are articulated by leaders elected by popular vote – and can often be voted down by opposition lawmakers – China’s five-year plans are crafted in the upper echelons of the Communist Party, ostensibly with what Beijing calls “mass consultation” with various sectors of society. Xi sits “at the helm” of this process, according to state media.Once set, five-year plans act as marching orders for officials across the sprawling apparatus of the government and a guide for businesses, universities and other organizations on how to align their own strategies with the party’s.Such plans have at times had disastrous consequences. The “Great Leap Forward” associated with the second five-year plan of 1958, that was supposed to drive China’s industrialization, instead drove the country into famine, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.More recently, plans have spurred China’s energetic efforts to build out new industries like green technology and electric vehicles and upgrade factory production, but also shown some of the drawbacks of state-backed planning.Take EVs, for example. China now dominates the sector globally, yet state support has also created artificial market saturation, driving price wars and an ongoing wave of company failures.But for Xi, who is determined not to see China’s rise hindered by Western export controls and trade barriers, it’s clear that the power to chart out a vision, to deliver with a deadline in 2030, underlines his faith that his system will ultimately win out.Or in his own words, as recently quoted in state media, when it comes to China’s “revitalization,” this planning creates “a vital political advantage.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

The centre-right politician has brought in military crackdowns on drug gangs, but has also faced accusations of targeting protesters.Noboa has denied the allegations of attempts on his life - the third in two months - were a means of portraying his detractors as violent.\"No one throws a Molotov cocktail at themselves... or poisons themselves with chocolate, or throws stones at themselves,\" he said, referring to previous incidents.Early in October, Ecuador's government said five people were detained over what it described as an alleged assassination attempt.About 500 people threw rocks at the president's car and there were \"signs of bullet damage\" on his vehicle, according to the country's energy and environment minister, who added that Noboa was unharmed.The BBC was not able to independently confirm that a bullet had been fired.The government also said that, in late September, a humanitarian convoy containing Noboa was attacked and 17 soldiers taken hostage.Ecuadorian officials said the convoy - which included UN and EU diplomats - was delivering aid to communities affected by a national strike when ambushed by about 350 people, who attacked it with Molotov cocktails.Noboa posted photos of smashed windscreens and windows on the cars on social media.A national strike protesting against the government ending diesel subsidies came to a close on Thursday after several weeks.The strike was declared by the country's largest Indigenous organisation - the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) - with marches and roadblocks organised.The Conaie group led demonstrations that overthrew three presidents between 1997 and 2005.Copyright 2025 BBC.

In the 2020 general election, left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein – the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army – won the most first-preference votes for the first time since the country’s founding, bringing an end to the traditional two-party dominance of the centre-right parties Fianna Fail (FF) and Fine Gael (FG). By the end of the voting process, Sinn Fein had 37 seats, finishing close to neck-and-neck with FF at 38 and FG at 35.There are 174 seats in Dail Eireann (Irish for Ireland’s lower house of parliament) in total, with 88 needed to form a government.The two previously dominant parties’ origins date back to the Irish Civil War and its aftermath, with FG’s forerunner supporting the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which granted the country partial independence, and FF opposing it.For the first time in their history, FF and FG were forced to enter into a formal coalition government with the Green Party in 2020 to be able to form a government. Following the 2024 election, they partnered with independents instead of the Greens.The presidency has a relatively limited political role, comparable to that of monarchs in other countries, said Gail McElroy, a professor of political science at Trinity College Dublin. It is “seen as a unifying role beyond politics”.The president represents Ireland abroad and hosts visiting heads of state and other dignitaries at the official presidential residence, Aras an Uachtarain, in Dublin’s Phoenix Park.The president is, above all, responsible for ensuring that the Irish Constitution is followed.After the presidency was established in 1938, one year after the current Bunreacht na hEireann (Irish constitution) was adopted, it was generally held by a statesman with a long affiliation to one of the two main political parties. For instance, Eamon de Valera, one of the leading political figures during Ireland’s War for Independence and founder of FF, served as taoiseach (prime minister) from 1937 to 1948, 1951 to 1954 and from 1957 to 1959, and then as the country’s third president from 1959 to 1973.The election of Mary Robinson, Ireland’s first female president, in 1990 “marked a watershed moment”, McElroy told Al Jazeera.The election of Robinson, who had been nominated by the Labour Party and the Workers’ Party, and also received official support from the Green Party, transformed the presidency from a largely symbolic, conservative office into one with more significant diplomatic influence. Her presidential campaign had included a commitment to expand the role of the president into a more active one focused on social issues and to foster an image of a “new Ireland”.Before becoming president, she had served as a senator in Seanad Eireann (Irish senate) from 1969 to 1989, and been a member of the Dublin City Council from 1979 to 1983.During her time in office, she signed two significant bills that she had fought for throughout her political career: a 1992 bill to fully liberalise the law on the availability of contraceptives, and a 1993 bill fully decriminalising homosexuality. She also signed the legalisation of divorce into law in 1996.As president, Robinson also took significant steps to foster an atmosphere of reconciliation between Ireland and the United Kingdom. She made history by being the first Irish president to meet a British monarch, then Queen Elizabeth II, in an official capacity. She also controversially met and shook hands with Gerry Adams, then the leader of Sinn Fein, a significant move towards dialogue at a critical time in the Northern Ireland peace process.And finally, Robinson used her presidential platform to advocate for human rights worldwide, notably becoming the first head of state to visit Somalia in 1992 following the civil war and famine, drawing international attention to the country’s humanitarian crisis.Mary McAleese, the first person born in Northern Ireland to serve as president, held the office from 1997 to 2011 – like Robinson, during pivotal years for the Northern Ireland peace process that culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ending the three-decade sectarian conflict that had begun in the late 1960s in Northern Ireland, known as The Troubles. Her emphasis on reconciliation culminated in a historic state visit to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth II.Michael D Higgins, president since 2011, has stretched the conventions of his office with, at times, strong criticism of government policy on both domestic and foreign policy issues, particularly regarding the country’s housing crisis and longstanding policy of military neutrality.Higgins has also been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, in line with the overwhelming majority of the Irish public, and has been unequivocal in calling for a permanent ceasefire since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza.The Irish government has been one of the most critical voices of Israel within the European Union, supporting South Africa’s genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.Higgins has described Israel’s war on Gaza as the “incredible destruction of an entire people” and echoed the Irish government in calling it a breach of international law.At times, Higgins has made statements and proposed actions that go beyond the realm of formal government policy. He said accusations of anti-Semitism against those who criticise the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amount to “slander against Ireland”, and has even suggested that Israel and the countries that supply it with weapons should be excluded from the United Nations.Any Irish citizen aged 35 or above can seek nomination for the presidency by following one of three routes.One way to be nominated is through being endorsed by 20 members of the Oireachtas (parliament). There are 174 members of the Dail and another 60 senators in the Seanad. Alternatively, a presidential hopeful can be nominated by four out of Ireland’s 31 local authorities.A sitting president may also nominate themselves to run for a second and final term, without the support of members of the Oireachtas or local authorities. In recent history, both McAleese and Higgins nominated themselves for second terms.Only Irish citizens who are at least 18 years old can vote for the president. About 3.5 million people in the country are eligible. Official voter turnout is generally low for presidential elections in Ireland, with the last one in 2018 at just 43.9 percent.Officially, there are three presidential candidates: Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, who withdrew from the presidential race earlier this month – but after a deadline for doing so had passed, meaning that votes for him can still be counted.Whichever candidate is elected will have large shoes to fill, as Higgins, whose second term ends in November, is regarded as one of Ireland’s most popular politicians.While pollsters currently have Connolly as the favourite for the race, more than 35 percent of respondents have indicated in polls that they will either spoil their vote or not vote at all.Connolly, 68, an independent, is backed by a coalition of left-wing parties, including Sinn Fein, the Green Party and the Social Democrats, among others, and several independent Oireachtas members.Connolly began her political career in 1999, when she was elected to the Galway City Council as a Labour candidate and then served as mayor of Galway, in the western part of the country, from 2004 to 2005. She left the Labour Party in 2007 due to a dispute over candidate selection for the general election, leading her to run as an independent candidate.She has been serving as the TD (Teachta Dala; member of the Dail) for Galway West since 2016. Connolly has also worked as a barrister and clinical psychologist.Connolly would be expected to continue Higgins’s legacy of criticising the government, “and maybe go even further than Higgins”, given that she has always been in opposition, both when she was a member of the Labour Party and as an independent, said Colfer.Connolly has said she is running to use the presidency as an active moral and ethical voice for the nation, with a strong focus on addressing the housing and homelessness crisis and supporting the most vulnerable, including people with disabilities. Her platform also includes promoting the Irish language and supporting a vision for a united – and more equal – Ireland. And lastly, she is campaigning on defending Irish neutrality as an active tradition of peace-making and advocates for human rights on the international stage, including strong support for the Palestinian people.Regarding Israel’s war on Gaza, she has said: “Israel have committed genocide in Gaza. The normalisation of genocide is catastrophic for the Palestinian people, and it is catastrophic for humanity. History didn’t begin on October 7. I will stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people as long as I have breath in my body.”Opinion polls conducted during the presidential campaign indicate that young people overwhelmingly support Connolly, along with those aligned with the left-wing and independent political parties backing her presidential bid.Connolly is the favourite to win the presidency, with the latest poll conducted by Irish broadcaster RTE putting her support at 38 percent.Humphreys, 62, the candidate for FG, is an experienced cabinet member, having held a range of portfolios, including justice and rural development, from 2014 to early 2025.She also served as a TD for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, on the border with Northern Ireland, and as the FG’s deputy leader.Given Humphreys’s political background, she would be much more likely not to challenge government orthodoxy, thus returning the office to a more ceremonial one, said Colfer.Her campaign is centred on celebrating local volunteerism and extending the presidency’s reach across the country. A key aspect of her campaign is also her background as a Presbyterian from Monaghan. She has pledged to use this identity to build bridges between nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland and promote reconciliation across the island, framing herself as a unifying candidate. Humphreys has also strongly advocated for the development and renewal of rural Ireland and support for Irish businesses internationally. Lastly, she has pledged to support the most vulnerable, such as promising increased pension/disability payments.Humphreys is predicted to win 20 percent of the vote.Gavin, 54, was the candidate for FF, which is the largest party in parliament and is led by the prime minister, Micheal Martin. He is a former Gaelic football team manager who also served for 20 years in the Irish defence forces. Gavin is currently working as the chief operations officer for the Irish Aviation Authority.Gavin announced his withdrawal from the race on October 5 following allegations in the Irish Independent newspaper that he owed 3,300 euros ($3,850) to a former tenant. His name still appears on the ballot, however, as he withdrew after the deadline for doing so had passed. “This means he is still a valid candidate,” according to the Irish Examiner newspaper. “Any votes cast for him will be counted as normal, meaning he could still win and become Ireland’s 10th president.”Ever since Gavin withdrew his bid, he has no longer appeared in presidential debates held on Irish media outlets, narrowing the presidential contest to a two-horse race.Gavin is currently predicted to secure just 5 percent of the vote.If Gavin won the election, “he would presumably decline the role and therefore trigger a fresh election”, which would need to take place within 60 days, according to Irish online newspaper The Journal.Ireland uses an electoral system of proportional representation known as the Single Transferable Vote.In this system, a voter ranks candidates in order of preference by marking the numbers 1, 2, 3 (in the case of this presidential election) on their ballot. The voter is free to vote for just one or all three of the candidates.Before the official counting can take place, ballots are sorted in order of first-preference votes. Any spoiled votes are placed to one side, as they will not be counted.If no one secures an absolute majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the next preference marked by each voter.This elimination and transfer process continues until one candidate secures more than 50 percent of the votes.As Gavin’s name remains on the ballot, “it is possible that his transfers could yet be very important in deciding who will be the next president of Ireland”, according to the Irish Times newspaper.The election will take place on October 24, with the result expected the following day. The new president will be inaugurated at a ceremony in Dublin Castle.A number of political issues have emerged during the most recent presidential debates as both the leading candidates have parliamentary track records on issues important to voters, said Colfer.At the 2020 and 2024 general elections, housing was a defining electoral issue for voters. The country’s housing crisis peaked in 2013, as a severe supply shortage combined with a growing population resulted in a rapid escalation in rent and house prices, leading to record levels of homelessness and emigration, as well as widespread unaffordability.Higgins has reflected public anger with the government over this issue, condemning the housing crisis as “our great, great, great failure”, saying that it could no longer be considered a crisis but “a disaster”.It has been difficult for Humphreys to appease voters when responding to questions on this topic, given that she has been serving in government during this time, said Colfer.Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ireland has been reckoning with its policy of military neutrality, which was adopted at the outbreak of World War II, dubbed “The Emergency”, and has since been maintained by successive governments.While this policy, as well as a legislative mechanism known as the triple lock, are not “necessarily related”, some say that reforming the mechanism, as the Irish government has committed to do, “risks undermining the policy [of neutrality] and is a slippery slope towards abandoning it”, said Colfer.While opinion polls have repeatedly indicated that the majority of Irish people want to maintain the country’s policy of military neutrality, the discourse around other aspects traditionally associated with the policy, including defence spending and the triple lock, is “more refined now”, he said.“There is an understanding now that both more defence spending and replacing the triple lock doesn’t necessarily compromise or undermine neutrality.”An Irish Times poll conducted earlier this year found that 63 percent of voters support the country’s current model of neutrality, while 47 percent support maintaining the triple lock.A separate Irish Times poll conducted in June 2023 found that 55 percent of voters supported “significantly increasing Ireland’s military capacity” to defend its airspace and territorial waters.Under the triple lock, no more than 12 military personnel can be deployed to participate in overseas peacekeeping operations without the approval of all three of the Irish government, the Dail and the UN.The Irish government’s main argument for reforming the mechanism is to prevent a permanent member of the UN Security Council, like Russia or China, from having a de facto vote on Ireland’s participation in international peacekeeping missions because of the UN part of the triple lock. No new peacekeeping mandate has been approved by the council since 2014.Higgins has accused the government of “playing with fire” by holding public discussions that he believes are creating a dangerous “drift” away from Ireland’s policy of military neutrality and that risks “burying” Ireland in other people’s agendas.He has also criticised increased military spending as “shocking”, warning that it perpetuates “war as a state of mind” at the expense of investing in essential areas such as education and healthcare.While the Irish government announced in July 2022 the largest increase in defence spending in the country’s history, jumping from 1.1 billion euros ($1.3bn) to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7bn) by 2028, Ireland continues to have one of the lowest defence budgets in Europe.The government argues that reforming the triple lock would not change the policy of military neutrality, which it defines as “non-membership of military alliances or mutual defence arrangements”.Over the course of the presidential campaign, Connolly has positioned herself as a strong defender of Ireland’s longstanding policy of military neutrality and the triple lock mechanism.“I believe in neutrality as an active, living tradition of peacemaking, bridge-building, and compassionate diplomacy. The triple lock is core to our neutrality. It is one of Ireland’s greatest strengths, and I will defend it and the triple lock with determination.”Connolly has also stated that she is opposed to any move that would lead the country to become involved in “dangerous NATO or EU militarisation”.Humphreys, however, has stressed that while she supports a review of the triple lock, she is not proposing abandoning Ireland’s policy of military neutrality.Regarding the triple lock, she has said: “No other country should have a veto over where members of the Irish defence forces serve.”Humphreys has framed herself as a candidate who would maintain strong relationships with European partners and allies and has warned against Connolly’s approach, which she says could be seen as “insulting Ireland’s allies” like Germany, France, the United States and the UK.Since Brexit, Britain’s departure from the EU in January 2020, the topic of Irish reunification has been much more in the public realm than it was even 10 years ago, said Colfer.Both main candidates have stated that they are proud Republicans and express support for Irish reunification.While Connolly may appear to have the obvious advantage with the official support of Sinn Fein, Colfer argues that Humphreys may actually have the upper hand due to her personal connection to Northern Ireland.In addition to her religious background and upbringing, Humphreys has a connection to the Orange Order, a conservative Protestant fraternal society associated with British unionism, through her father and husband, who are both former members. Her grandfather signed the Ulster Covenant in 1912, a petition against Irish self-government.These links to a longstanding Protestant organisation “will help open up a line of communication with Unionists” for Humphreys, seen as important in bridge-building between Northern Ireland’s Catholic and Protestant communities ahead of a reunification referendum, said Colfer.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"VideoVideoChildren starve in refugee camp as USAID cuts bite3:14","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/world/video/usaid-cuts-myanmar-rohingya-refugee-children-starve-digvid","message":"","news":"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has doubled down on the assertion that \"none died\" due to USAID cuts.

We have a very good relationship, but that will be a big one,” Trump said as he answered questions alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte at the White House.The meeting between Trump and Xi will take place amid escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The US leader has imposed a 30 percent tariff on Chinese imports into the US and threatened higher levies in the near future should a deal not be struck.Trump also said he will push Xi to stop Chinese companies from purchasing Russian oil, after he imposed his first sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday since returning to the White House.The sanctions package – which targeted Russia’s two largest oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil – was the result of Russian President Vladimir Putin refusing “to end this senseless war” in Ukraine, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.Outlining the US leader’s full itinerary, Leavitt said Trump will depart the White House on Friday night before landing in Malaysia, where the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit is taking place next week, on Sunday morning local time.“President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Malaysia in the afternoon [on Sunday], and then he will attend the ASEAN leaders’ working dinner that evening,” she said.The US leader will then travel to Tokyo on Monday morning, where he will attend a bilateral meeting with Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday.Leavitt said Trump will then “travel to Busan on Wednesday [October 29] morning for a bilateral meeting with the president of the Republic of Korea, deliver a keynote address at the APEC CEO luncheon and attend the leaders’ working dinner that evening”.Korean government officials later said the meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung would actually take place in the city of Gyeongju, where this year’s APEC summit is being hosted, according to The Korea Economic Daily newspaper.The mix-up, according to the officials, likely stems from Busan reportedly being the venue for the US-China summit. Leavitt did not confirm where Trump would meet Xi in her comments to reporters on Thursday.President Lee plans to hold meetings with Trump and Xi separately, according to South Korean presidential security adviser Wi Sung-lac.“Through a series of summits between the leaders of South Korea and the United States, the United States and China, and South Korea and China, we will not only highlight South Korea’s role as a platform but also build consensus for peace, prosperity, and stability in the region,” Wi told reporters.He continued that South Korea was hoping to move forward with Washington on issues surrounding security and tariffs, but he was uncertain whether any agreement would be reached.Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan said on Friday that Seoul and Washington remain “at odds” on how to implement a $350bn investment pledge by South Korea as part of a deal to lower tariffs on its exports to the US.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Ghana's former First Lady Nana Konadu Rawlings dies aged 76","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ex80zp2no","message":"","news":"Ghana's former First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings has died at the age of 76.She was the widow of Ghana's longest-serving leader, Jerry John Rawlings, who died five years ago.He led two coups before twice being elected president in multiparty polls.Social media is awash with tributes to the former first lady, politician and women's rights advocate, who Ghanaian presidential spokesperson Felix Kwakye Ofosu said had died after a short illness on Thursday morning.Her family visited President John Mahama in the afternoon to officially notify him of her death. The president leads the National Democratic Congress (NDC) party, founded by Jerry Rawlings after he took power.Agyeman-Rawlings also had political ambitions - but lost out in her bid to become the NDC's presidential candidate in 2012.As first lady, she founded the 31st December Women's Movement to empower women and teach them how to earn money to develop their communities. It was named after the date of her husband's second coup, which took place in 1981.Born in November 1948, Agyeman-Rawlings came from a middle-class family and grew up in the city of Cape Coast.She met her future husband when she became a boarder at the prestigious Achimota School in the capital, Accra.Unlike her husband, she went on to get a university education, studying art and textiles.Jerry Rawlings joined the air force and earned the rank of flight lieutenant in 1978 - a year after the couple were married.It was not long afterwards that Rawlings, aged 32, took power, with his wife said to be one of his most important advisers.Young, glamourous and charismatic, they proved a dynamic if controversial duo in the West African nation. Together they had four children and their eldest - Dr  Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings - has gone into politics serving as an NDC MP.The former first lady's women's group, initially regarded as an arm of the NDC, is credited with significantly helping women across the country - especially in poorer areas.Her advocacy also influenced national policy and she played a key role in shaping a law in 1989 that guaranteed inheritance rights for women and children.She is also credited with contributing to provisions for gender equality in Ghana's 1992 constitution, which saw the return of multiparty politics.Ghana's parliament has adjourned to mark the former first lady's death as the country prepares to officially mourn one of its most iconic political figures and one who fought for the inclusion of women in politics.Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaA selection of the week's best photos from across the African continent and beyond.Nnamdi Kanu is on trial for terrorism and incitement to violence as head of the separatist group, Ipob.All the victims and those rescued were from sub-Saharan African countries, an official says.The fervour of presidential campaigning belies concerns about the political landscape in a cocoa superpower.Results will be announced on Monday, prolonging the uncertainty with the opposition claiming victory.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 grew a tooth from human and mouse cells.This year, she led a study that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.“It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”This tiny robot spins blood clots awayOther researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — in pigs. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, has successfully grown dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.© 2025 Cable News Network.

Haiti has been devastated by past storms, given widespread erosion and limited preparation due to gang violence, poverty and weak governance.The storm also knocked out dozens of water supply systems in the Dominican Republic, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights and unleashed several small landslides.All public schools across the Dominican Republic would close on Friday, while government offices in 12 provinces under alert would do the same, officials said.In Jamaica, Matthew Samuda, the minister of economic growth and job creation, said the situation was “serious” and warned people not to be fooled by the storm’s current pace and strength. “Be very attentive, because it can change in a moment’s notice,” he said.Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, and the first named storm to form in the Caribbean this year.The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal season – runs from June 1 to November 30 – with 13 to 18 named storms.Of those, five to nine were forecast to become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes, which pack winds of 111mph (178km/h) or greater.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Vance and Rubio criticise Israeli parliament's vote on West Bank annexation","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xvj108z9o","message":"","news":"US Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticised a move by Israel's parliament towards annexation of the occupied West Bank.On Wednesday, far-right politicians in the Knesset took the symbolic step of giving preliminary approval to a bill applying Israeli law in the territory, which the Palestinians claim as part of a hoped-for independent state.At the end of a trip to Israel, Vance branded it a \"very stupid political stunt\". Rubio warned before flying to Israel that annexation would threaten President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict in Gaza.Israel's prime minister called the move a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\".A statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office stressed that his right-wing Likud party and its ultra-Orthodox coalition partners did not vote for the bill, \"except for one disgruntled Likud member who was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee\".\"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it added.The prime minister's office put out the statement in English after Vance was asked about the vote by reporters before he boarded his plane at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.\"If it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult,\" he said. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel.\"\"That will continue to be our policy. If people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that. But we certainly weren't happy about it.\"Time magazine also published an interview with President Trump in which he insisted that annexation would not happen \"because I gave my word to the Arab countries.\"\"Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,\" he added.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice last year.Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously spoken in support of annexing West Bank land but has not advanced this due to the risk of alienating the US - Israel's most important ally - and Arab countries which have built relations with Israel after decades of enmity.Ultra-nationalists in Netanyahu's governing coalition have repeatedly called for Israel to annex the West Bank outright, though the bill was put forward by MPs outside the government.The bill passed in a 25-24 vote. It is unclear whether it has support to win a majority in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), and there are ways the prime minister can delay or defeat it.The bill will now be discussed by the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and would have to pass three more readings to become law.The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's move, saying Israel would have no sovereignty over Palestinian land.Before leaving for Israel on Wednesday night, Rubio said annexation would be \"counterproductive\" for Trump's Gaza peace plan - reiterating US opposition to annexation.\"I think the president's made clear that's not something we'd be supportive of right now. And we think it's even threatening to the peace deal,\" he said.His visit on Thursday comes hot on the heels of trips by Vance and two US special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as the Trump administration attempts to push for the start of talks on the second critical phase of his 20-point Gaza peace plan.The first phase - which includes a ceasefire, the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces and an influx of aid - came into effect earlier this month.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement over deadly incidents, but it has so far held.Rubio voiced similar optimism to that of Vance for preserving the ceasefire.\"Every day there'll be threats to it, but I actually think we're ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign,\" he said.The second phase of the peace plan would involve setting up an interim government in Gaza, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.In the ensuing conflict, more than 68,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.Additional reporting by Chris GrahamThe US president says he is axing negotiations over an advert that used Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs.It will be the first face-to-face meeting for both leaders since Trump's return to office.Immigrant doctors, many of them from India, are the lifeline of the US healthcare system, especially in rural areas.A former White House chief ethics lawyer described the ballroom donations as an ethical \"nightmare\".President Trump says he wants to tackle the drugs trade but many believe he is trying to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro.Copyright 2025 BBC.

The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that published Thursday in the journal Science.In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.“It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.“The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.“Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first described as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.Iceland just found its first mosquitoes“We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.“Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The article went on to note that one of the looted diadems “features 24 Ceylon sapphires and 1,083 diamonds that can be detached and worn as brooches, according to the Louvre”.The sensational hand-wringing was almost reminiscent of another contemporary “national disaster” in Paris – namely, the April 2019 fire at the Notre Dame cathedral that broke the hearts of politicians worldwide, even as they remained apparently unmoved by such objectively more tragic events as Israel’s recurrent slaughter of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.And now that we have just witnessed two years of all-out genocide in Gaza courtesy of the United States-backed Israeli military, it seems that the loss of all those sapphires and diamonds might ultimately not really be so “disastrous”, after all – at least in terms of, you know, the general state of humanity and the future of the planet.In fact, many of us might even find ourselves rooting for the thieves, to some extent – if only as a symbolic middle finger to a world predicated on obscene inequality and misplaced priorities.To be sure, the Louvre and like-minded elite art institutions are themselves symbolic of historical injustice, serving as they do as repositories for treasures accrued by royals who built their very wealth on the backs of the working classes – not to mention cultural artefacts and stolen relics from former colonial possessions and other imperial stamping grounds.Talk about “looting”.In her book Decolonize Museums, curator and scholar Shimrit Lee notes that “even the term ‘loot’ derived from the Hindi ‘lut’, meaning ‘stolen property’, was appropriated into the English language as a result of British control of India”. Remarking on how the British Museum in London has traditionally “showcased plundered sculptures from India as well as the bronzes of Benin”, the West African kingdom in what is now Nigeria that was invaded by Britain in 1897 and subsequently subsumed into the British Empire, Lee observes that “France’s Louvre created galleries in the early 1800s specifically to house the many objects nabbed by Napoleon and his entourage in Egypt”.Nowadays, Lee writes, it is “impossible to find a Western museum that doesn’t hold some amount of cultural material from Africa, Asia, Oceania, or Native America” – a legacy of violent and extractive colonialism whose repercussions continue to impact the lives of Indigenous and Black people across the world. And yet “the museum, with its white walls and white lights, aids in historical amnesia, tricking visitors into believing that this violence only exists in the past”.Enter Sunday’s jewel thieves, who – against such a white-walled, white-lit backdrop – might even assume the role of semi-Robin-Hood-type heroes. Unfortunately, this sort of romanticisation falls short, as the would-be Robin Hoods most likely did not undertake their spectacular stunt as a politico-cultural statement against historical amnesia but rather in the interest of making bank by peddling the looted treasures to other rich people specialising in the art of exploitative economics.In her recent article on the heist, Emiline Smith – a lecturer in criminology at the University of Glasgow in Scotland – emphasises that the stolen jewels are “products of a long history of colonial extraction”, the looted gemstones having been mined in Asia, Africa, and South America, regions that were “systematically exploited for their cultural and natural resources to enrich European courts and empires”.As Smith puts it, France’s “colonial outposts and broader European networks funnelled such valuable resources to royal courts and elite collectors” – all with the help of good old slavery. Among the funnelled items is a 19th-century sculpture by enslaved court artist Akati Ekplekendo of the kingdom of Dahomey – formerly a colony of France – in the present-day Republic of Benin (not to be confused with the British-appropriated kingdom of Benin), which Smith notes “Benin has repeatedly requested back yet is still exhibited in the Louvre’s Pavillon des Sessions”.Again, then, it is not difficult to see why those of us concerned with global justice might theoretically be inclined to view with favour the material loss inflicted on the Louvre on Sunday.At the end of the day, though, the heist is not quite worthy of romanticisation. Nor, however, is it worthy of categorisation as a “national disaster” – or an international one. And the fact that there are folks who would cast it as such is pretty much a disaster in itself.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"How the outsourcing sector became South Africa's newest goldmine","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50ze3ee7po","message":"","news":"Esethu Dywili says his lucrative accountancy work has given him the chance to change his family's life.The 31-year-old has spent a number of years working in South Africa's fast-growing outsourced financial services sector.An outsourced services company is one, often based in a poorer country, which does work for other businesses, typically big firms in Europe and North America.Examples include call-centres in the Philippines, IT operations in India, and South African companies that offer auditing and other finance work.Back in 2022, Mr Dywili had earned enough money to build a new house for his parents and siblings. They live in a village in the country's Eastern Cape province, an 11-hour drive from Johannesburg, where Mr Dywili now resides.\"When you work for a firm that earns its revenue in US dollars or British pounds, they are able to pay competitive salaries that perhaps you would not get working for a local South African company,\" says Mr Dywili, who has a degree in commerce and accounting.Carving out a career in South Africa's booming outsourced services industry is not something to be taken lightly when you consider the country's unemployment rate is around 33%, one of the highest in the world.South Africa's growing popularity as an outsourcing destination has been fueled by a number of factors. Firms in countries such as the UK have been moving work abroad due to both a drive to cut costs, and a reported lack of available UK staff in sectors such as accountancy.With salaries in South Africa around half of those in the UK, the country's outsourced services industry has developed a niche in financial services, along with IT and software development, data analytics and digital marketing.English language proficiency, a high level of education, and a time difference of just one or two hours with the UK also appeal to big companies.\"There's just such a great work ethic in South Africa, and an energy about South Africans,\" says Simon Wheeler, a Durban-based chartered accountant who also works in the sector.\"We're go-getters and give 110% to everything. So South Africans are really grabbing these opportunities with both hands, and taking full advantage of them.\"It now gives them that opportunity to take their career to new heights, and get that experience whilst in the country, as traditionally, it always used to be that you would have to relocate outside of South Africa to get that international experience.\"The outsourcing sector now contributes 35bn rand ($2bn; £1.5bn) to the South African economy per year, according to figures from the Western Cape regional government.Nezaam Joseph is chief director in the Department of Economic Development for the Western Cape government, where around 60 outsourcing firms are based. The department has been one of the earliest supporters of the sector, says Mr Joseph.Around six years ago, it began offering outsourced services firms in the province 3,500 South African rand per month, as part of a subsidised training programme for around 4,500 people a year. It says that around 80% of those people have gone on to be hired by firms full time.Mr Joseph says that more than 70,000 people are now employed in the Cape to service the outsourced needs of overseas companies. \"We added about 10,000 jobs last year, and another 10,000 plus jobs this year. Fifteen years ago, we had less than 2,000 offshore jobs.\"UK accountancy firm Cooper Parry is one British company that has outsourced work to South Africa. It turned to South African outsourcing finance firms Makosi and PKF Octagon to fill hundreds of roles during the Covid-19 pandemic.Gemma Edwards, a partner at Cooper Parry and its head of transformation and business services, says the company was so impressed with its South African partners that it recently opened an office of its own in the country. This now has 60 team members, including both Mr Dywili and Mr Wheeler.Ms Edwards says the South African employees \"have become an extension of our UK teams\".  She adds: \"They join the same calls as us… it's not them and us - we're one global team.\"UK call-centre firm Ventrica, which works with brands such as shoemaker Clarks and McDonald's, opened an operation in South Africa in 2022. Around 30% of its workforce is now based there, with plans to grow this to 40%.Ventrica's chief executive Iain Banks says that its cost-conscious clients are happy for their call-centre operations to be based in South Africa, while others believe that their business is safer remaining in the UK.\"For example, there's a FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] brand we move with,\" says Mr Banks. \"And if I were to embark on a conversation about South Africa, they would march out the door straight away.\"That may change though, as more and more highly educated South Africans enter the industry.  That is certainly what Mr Joseph anticipates, as the Western Cape government plans to work more closely with universities to make curriculums a better fit for what outsourcing industry employers need.But Jee-A van der Linde, a Cape Town-based senior economist, is concerned that, despite those ambitions, the South African education system isn't going to be able to keep pace with the outsourcing industry's growth, both in size and in importance to the country.\"The quality of education, from a social perspective, is one of the biggest hindrances for the South African economy, and a big reason for the skills deficit that we have in South Africa,\" he says.He's also concerned that not all opportunities in the South African outsourcing industry are being spread equally across the country. While many jobs could be done remotely, unstable internet connections in rural areas would rule this out.\"South Africa is a relatively big country,\" adds Mr van der Linde. \"You have your major hubs like Johannesburg and Durban, but there are gaps in how different parties govern different provinces. Some have a more business-friendly mindset.\"With those disparities, it's natural you'll likely end up with an imbalance in terms of how the outsourcing industry can actually impact unemployment across the whole country.\"Yet if the Western Cape government's university collaboration strategy proves successful, it won't just mean more jobs, but likely rising salaries, too. So what happens then to all the companies relying on South Africa's cost effectiveness?They'll look further across Africa, predicts Ventrica's Mr Banks, who says outsourcing industries are already emerging in Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria.\"It started with India as the first offshoring location,\" says Mr Banks. \"It then went to the Philippines, and now South Africa is booming. But South Africa will get to a point where it will peak out, and then the industry needs to find another location, and that appears to be elsewhere in Africa,\" says Mr Banks.But in the meantime, Mr Dywili says that opportunities in the sector in South Africa provide a palpable, but rare, sense of optimism for youngsters in the country.\"Young people have felt demoralised by the limited opportunities we've had here in South Africa,\" he says. Mr Dywili adds that more are choosing to get degrees such as in accountancy that provide a pathway to work in the outsourcing industry.It will be the first face-to-face meeting for both leaders since Trump's return to office.Plastic recycling plants in Europe are being shut as they struggle to find a business modelTech firms are developing more affordable ways to detect and destroy drones.Fixtures, results and scorecards from South Africa's tour of Pakistan, featuring two Tests, three ODIs and three Twenty20 internationals.The tech giant also announced a new robotic arm and an AI tool to improve efficiency at its warehouses.Copyright 2025 BBC.

In his rhetoric, he claims credit for his efforts to end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Yet beneath the grandstanding lies an absence of substance, at least to date.The problem is not Trump’s lack of effort, but his lack of proper concepts. Trump confuses “peace” with “ceasefires,” which sooner or later revert to war (typically sooner). In fact, American presidents from Lyndon Johnson onward have been subservient to the military-industrial complex, which profits from endless war. Trump is merely following in that line by avoiding a genuine resolution to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.Peace is not a ceasefire. Lasting peace is achieved by resolving the underlying political disputes that led to the war. This requires grappling with history, international law and political interests that fuel conflicts. Without addressing the root causes of war, ceasefires are a mere intermission between rounds of slaughter.Trump has proposed what he calls a “peace plan” for Gaza. However, what he outlines amounts to nothing more than a ceasefire. His plan fails to address the core political issue of Palestinian statehood. A true peace plan would tie together four outcomes: the end of Israel’s genocide, Hamas’s disarmament, Palestine’s membership in the United Nations, and the normalisation of diplomatic ties with Israel and Palestine throughout the world. These foundational principles are absent from Trump’s plan, which is why no country has signed off on it despite White House insinuations to the contrary.  At most, some countries have backed the “Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity,” a temporising gesture.Trump’s peace plan was presented to Arab and Muslim countries to deflect attention from the global momentum for Palestinian statehood. The US plan is designed to undercut that momentum, allowing Israel to continue its de facto annexation of the West Bank and its ongoing bombardment of Gaza and restrictions of emergency relief under the ruse of security. Israel’s ambitions are to eradicate the possibility of a Palestinian state, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made explicit at the UN in September.  So far, Trump and his associates have simply been advancing Netanyahu’s agenda.Trump’s “plan” is already unravelling, much like the Oslo Accords, the Camp David Summit, and every other “peace process” that treated Palestinian statehood as a distant aspiration rather than the solution to the conflict.  If Trump really wants to end the war – a somewhat doubtful proposition – he’d have to break with Big Tech and the rest of the military-industrial complex (recipients of vast arms contracts funded by the US).  Since October 2023, the US has spent $21.7bn on military aid to Israel, much of it returning to Silicon Valley.Trump would also have to break with his donor-in-chief, Miriam Adelson, and the Zionist lobby.  In doing so, he would at least represent the American people (who support a state of Palestine) and uphold American strategic interests. The US would join the overwhelming global consensus, which endorses the implementation of the two-state solution, rooted in UN Security Council resolutions and ICJ opinions.The same failure of Trump’s peacemaking holds in Ukraine. Trump repeatedly claimed during the campaign that he could end the war “in 24 hours”. Yet what he has been proposing is a ceasefire, not a political solution. The war continues.The cause of the Ukraine war is no mystery – if one looks beyond the pablum of the mainstream media. The casus belli was the push by the US military-industrial complex for NATO’s endless expansion, including to Ukraine and Georgia, and the US-backed coup in Kyiv in February 2014 to bring to power a pro-NATO regime, which ignited the war. The key to peace in Ukraine, then and now, was for Ukraine to maintain its neutrality as a bridge between Russia and NATO.In March-April 2022, when Turkiye mediated a peace agreement in the Istanbul Process, based on Ukraine’s return to neutrality, the Americans and the British pushed the Ukrainians to walk out of the talks. Until the US clearly renounces NATO’s expansion to Ukraine, there can be no sustainable peace. The only way forward is a negotiated settlement based on Ukraine’s neutrality in the context of mutual security of Russia, Ukraine, and the NATO countries.Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz famously characterised war as the continuation of politics with other means. He was right. Yet it is more accurate to say that war is the failure of politics that leads to conflict. When political problems are deferred or denied, and governments fail to negotiate over essential political issues, war too often ensues.  Real peace requires the courage and capacity to engage in politics, and to face down the war profiteers.No president since John F Kennedy has really tried to make peace. Many close observers of Washington believe that it was Kennedy’s assassination that irrevocably put the military-industrial complex in the seat of power. In addition, the US arrogance of power already noted by J William Fulbright in the 1960s (in reference to the misguided Vietnam War) is another culprit. Trump, like his predecessors, believes that US bullying, misdirection, financial pressures, coercive sanctions and propaganda will be enough to force Putin to submit to NATO, and the Muslim world to submit to Israel’s permanent rule over Palestine.Trump and the rest of the Washington political establishment, beholden to the military-industrial complex, will not on their own account move beyond these ongoing delusions. Despite decades of Israeli occupation of Palestine and more than a decade of war in Ukraine (which started with the 2014 coup), the wars continue despite the ongoing attempts by the US to assert its will. In the meantime, the money pours into the coffers of the war machine.Nonetheless, there is still a glimmer of hope, since reality is a stubborn thing.When Trump soon arrives in Budapest to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his deeply knowledgeable and realistic host, Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, can help Trump to grasp a fundamental truth: NATO enlargement must end to bring peace to Ukraine. Similarly, Trump’s trusted counterparts in the Islamic world –  Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto – can explain to Trump the utter necessity of Palestine as a UN member state now, as the very precondition of Hamas’s disarmament and peace, not as a vague promise for the end of history.Trump can bring peace if he reverts to diplomacy. Yes, he would have to face down the military-industrial complex, the Zionist lobby and the warmongers, but he would have the world and the American people on his side.The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Amazon apologises to customers impacted by huge AWS outage","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvnp77dy9o","message":"","news":"Amazon Web Services (AWS) has apologised to customers impacted by Monday's massive outage, after it knocked some of the world's largest platforms offline.Snapchat, Reddit and Lloyds Bank were among more than 1,000 sites and services reported to have gone down as a result of issues at the heart of the cloud computing giant's operations in North Virginia, US on 20 October.In a detailed summary of what caused the outage, Amazon said it occurred as a result of errors which meant its internal systems could not connect websites with the IP addresses computers use to find them.\"We apologise for the impact this event caused our customers,\" the company said.\"We know how critical our services are to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses.\"We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways.\"While many platforms such as the online games Roblox and Fortnite were back up and running within a few hours of the outage, some services experienced prolonged downtime.This included Lloyds Bank, with some customers experiencing issues until mid-afternoon, as well as US payments app Venmo and social media site Reddit.The outage had a far-reaching impact - even reportedly disrupting the sleep of some smart bed owners.Eight Sleep, which makes sleep \"pods\" with temperature and elevation options requiring an internet connection, said it would work to \"outage-proof\" its mattresses after some overheated and even got stuck in an inclined position.Many experts said the outage showed how reliant tech is on Amazon's dominance in the cloud computing sector, as a market largely cornered by AWS and Microsoft Azure.The company said it would also \"do everything we can\" to learn from the event and improve its availability.In its lengthy summary of Monday's outage, Amazon said it came down to an issue in US-EAST-1 - its largest cluster of data centres which power much of the internet.Critical processes in the region's database which stores and manages the Domain Name System (DNS) records, allowing website URLs to be understood by computers, effectively fell out of sync.According to Amazon, this triggered a \"latent race condition\" - or in other words unearthed a dormant bug that could occur in an unlikely sequence of events.The delay in one process, which Amazon said occurred in the early hours of Monday morning, had a knock-on effect which caused its systems to stop working properly.Much of this process is automated, meaning it is done without human involvement.Dr Junade Ali, a software engineer and fellow at the Institute for Engineering and Technology, told the BBC \"faulty automation\" had been at the core of Amazon's problems.\"The specific technical reason is a faulty automation broke the internal 'address book' systems in that region rely upon,\" he said.\"So they couldn't find one of the other key systems.\"Like others, Dr Ali believes it highlights the need for companies to be more resilient and diversify their cloud service providers \"so they can fail over to other data centres and providers when one isn't available\".\"In this instance, those who had a single point of failure in this Amazon region were susceptible to being taken offline,\" he said.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years.According to HWW, most healthcare workers were abducted by the Israeli military from their hospitals or ambulances while they were on duty. Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.Dr Rebecca Inglis, of HWW, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, was arrested by Israeli forces on December 27, 2024, after troops raided the hospital, which at the time was one of the last functioning medical facilities in the region.Amnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.Despite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.Since his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.At least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.Between October 7, 2023, to October 20, 2025, HWW documented a total of 431 cases of detained Palestinian healthcare workers.As of October 20, 2025:HWW has said it has not yet received an update from the families of 22 detained healthcare workers, who are not included in the “confirmed detained” or “confirmed released” figures.The healthcare professionals still detained by Israel have spent an average of 511 days in detention, with some held captive since the early weeks of the war.Of the 95 being held, 80 are from Gaza, while the remaining 15 are from the occupied West Bank.From Gaza alone, 31 nurses have been detained, followed by 17 physicians, 15 hospital support and management staff, 14 paramedics, two pharmacists and one medical technician. Twenty-five held senior positions, 50 occupied mid-level positions, while five were junior healthcare workers. All except one are male.Most of the healthcare workers lived in North Gaza, with 36 of the prisoners from there, followed by 24 from Khan Younis, 18 from Gaza City and 3 from Rafah.The table below lists more information about the 95 healthcare workers still held captive by Israel.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"VideoVideoMagnecko and RoBoa: rescue robots are here2:24","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/world/video/robots-disaster-relief-survivor-search-spc-digvid","message":"","news":"In a Swiss military training center, robots built by students and startups are being put to the test in simulated disaster scenarios.© 2025 Cable News Network.

Will he be able to rise above the relatively limited ability of the mayoral position to build the kind of coalition with state officials and lawmakers needed to realise his marquee pledges?“But we need fresh ideas to create opportunities,” said Tunkala, who is originally from the Gambia and sells sporting goods from a table on the street. “This is a new generation with new ideas for development, that’s why I support him.”Ahmed Jejote, a 55-year-old cab driver from Sierra Leone, echoed the sentiment.“We’ve experienced Eric Adams,” he said, referring to the corruption-plagued current city mayor, who dropped out of the race in September. “We’ve seen Cuomo.”“Mamdani is just starting out, and he wants to go forward,” he said. “So it’s not really about religion for me”.Blocks away, 46-year-old Mariam Saleh stood over steaming trays of food at Kumasi Restaurant: banku, a fermented mixture of maize and cassava; suya, a spiced meat skewer; kwenkwen, a type of jollof rice.She was less circumspect about the historic nature of Mamdani’s run.“That he is Muslim, for us, is huge progress,” the 46-year-old, who is originally from Ghana, told Al Jazeera.“It’s huge progress for the Muslim community in America, not just in New York.”Surging to a surprise victory in the June primary, Mamdani represents a kaleidoscope of the diversity that defines the city of more than 8.4 million, where an estimated 800 languages are spoken. Up to one million Muslims live in New York City, estimated to be a quarter of all Muslims in the US.Mamdani is socially progressive, with a history of grassroots activism and staunchly pro-Palestine views. While they do not define his campaign, he has embraced his ties to his birthplace, Uganda, and his identity as a Muslim son of parents of Indian Gujarati and Punjabi descent.For Asad Dandia, an urban historian, Mamdani’s success to date is a culmination of 400 years of Muslim history in the city, stretching back to the enslaved Africans brought to New York, about 30 percent of whom were Muslim.Muslim political power has been both inhibited and energised by waves of discrimination, including in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks and more recently, the genocide in Gaza.Dandia was among the New Yorkers surveilled in the wake of September 11, when the New York Police Department (NYPD) and federal government reportedly spied on at least 250 mosques within a 160km (100-mile) radius of the city, as well as an unknown number of individuals. He launched a successful lawsuit in 2013 after he was targeted by a confidential informant.Mamdani, who Dandia befriended last year, has also spoken about a classmate at his Bronx high school who was “pressured to become an informant”.“I honestly think some of us have forgotten how truly bad it was,” Dandia reflected, adding that US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory further charged political action.“So the last 25 years, since 9/11, have really moulded the community into becoming this formidable force. And I think nothing demonstrates that better than this mayoral election cycle,” the 32-year-old added.“It's crazy that the same police department that surveilled me and [Mamdani’s community] and the rest of the Muslim community is now going to be under his command.”Dandia’s home neighbourhood in Brighton Beach, where the outer edge of Brooklyn meets the Atlantic Ocean, is a study in the fickle nature of politics for communities that feel left behind.The area hosts a Pakistani enclave served by four mosques, as well as a quickly growing Uzbek Muslim population. On Fridays, the city sometimes closes a portion of one of the main streets to accommodate the overflow from prayer.Voters here swung towards Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but went for the Democratic Socialist Mamdani over his opponents in June’s Democratic primary.Erum Hanif, who heads a community centre launched after the neighbourhood was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, said the idiosyncratic shift indicates, in part, “that the current system is not working out”.“Many working-class New Yorkers are earning on a day-to-day basis - Uber drivers, grocery store workers, healthcare workers and the working professional, and they are struggling to afford to live. That made them shift towards Mamdani,” the 42-year-old said.At a daycare for the elderly run by Hanif’s group - APNA Brooklyn Community Center, which as an organisation does not endorse any candidate - the aunties said they were all in for Mamdani.Amina Malik, from Lahore, Pakistan, said a top concern is the high price of rent and childcare, both issues that impact elderly residents in an outsized way.“A lot of seniors like me are struggling to get into rent-stabilised buildings and apartments,” she said in Urdu. “Families cannot afford childcare - Mamdani is going to work on that.”Perveen Zia, 66, who is also from Lahore, saw in Mamdani the type of representation she had not witnessed before in City Hall - someone who “understands our language and culture” and will ensure services are administered “equitably”.“Zohran is like my son,” she said.About 18km (12 miles) away, in the Queens neighbourhood of South Richmond Hill, the minarets of Masjid Al Abidin rise above the roti shops and garland-laden bridal stores selling saris and shalwar kameez in “Little Guyana”.The area is a microcosm of the overlapping identities of the city’s vast patchwork of neighbourhoods, displaying Guyana’s mix of Indo-Caribbean and South Asian culture: a South American society where Christianity, Islam and Hinduism plait.“In this neighbourhood, everyone lives like they’re cousins,” said Annie Nazir, 46, who works in childcare and moved to the US from Georgetown, Guyana five years ago.But the masjid or mosque also underscores the challenges facing the local population. Construction on the towering structure began in 2012, but has sputtered amid various stresses, including the economic toll of the COVID pandemic. The project relies almost solely on community donations, those familiar said.Because of that, congregants currently pray in a nearby two-storey townhouse, with the women’s section located in a similar building across the street.“As working-class people, a lot of people think it’s time for a change,” Nazir, who attends the mosque, told Al Jazeera. She is a volunteer chapter leader for DRUM Beats, a political committee representing South Asian and Indo-Caribbean workers that is hoping to turn out the vote for Mamdani.The upstart politician has maintained a commanding lead in the polls since the primary, but that has narrowed since current Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race in September.Cuomo, meanwhile, has sought to make inroads in some of the communities that buoyed Mamdani.During a primary debate in June, the former governor struggled to name a single mosque he had visited during his 10 years in office. After losing the primary, Cuomo made his first visit of the campaign to a mosque in September, since visiting at least four in the Bronx and Queens.At least one Muslim religious leader, Imam Qazi Qayyoom based in Jackson Heights, Queens, has endorsed Cuomo.Mamdani jabbed Cuomo’s newfound approach during a debate on October 16.“It took me,” he said, “to get you to even see those parts of the city.”The line of attack has resonated with some in the Guyanese community, who noted Mamdani visited Masjid Al Abidin back in May ahead of the primary. Other ties to the community predate the election.As an assemblyman, Mamdani advocated for Prakash Churaman, a Guyanese immigrant who has maintained he was coerced into giving a false murder confession. He joined taxi workers in a 15-day hunger strike in 2021.Clint Ally, who spoke to Al Jazeera following evening prayers at the masjid, said he hopes Mamdani’s community-oriented style - which has included eschewing corporate donations for small donors - resonates.“He could go down in history as the first Muslim mayor, but this is a very diverse city,” the 49-year-old said.“We need someone who understands everybody.”Sitting in his office on 5th Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 71-year-old Zein Rimawi's eyes tear up as he watches a video of Palestinian prisoners being released as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.Mamdani’s outspoken support for Palestinian rights and condemnation of the genocide in Gaza has been particularly resonant in the local community, dubbed “Little Palestine”, where cafes bear names like “Al Aqsa Bakery” and “Nablus Sweets”.Rimawi said he has known Mamdani for about eight years, stretching back to when the then-20-something worked on a campaign in support of Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian-American Lutheran pastor who launched an unsuccessful bid for New York City Council in 2017.“I always say to young people: run for any seat. If you win, we win,” he said. “If you lose, we win.”“Because for a Muslim to run for a seat by itself, it's not easy, but it matters,” he said. “So it’s a win-win situation.”But Rimawi also saw Mamdani’s success - at least so far -  as the product of a widening wealth gap in the city, an issue particularly relevant in a neighbourhood like Bay Ridge, once a working-class stronghold where housing prices have skyrocketed in recent years.“When I got married in 1988, one week’s salary would cover the average rent. Now it costs most of your salary for a month,” said Rimawi, who is originally from the occupied West Bank. “The middle class here in New York is disappearing. If it keeps going like this, soon we’ll only have two classes: The rich and the poor.”Next door, Essa Masoud, 46, runs the Balady Market, selling products from across the Levant.The Palestinian American, who was born and raised in Bay Ridge, was not surprised to see the Islamophobic tropes pushed by the far right in the wake of Mamdani’s June victory.Trump has threatened to revoke Mamdani’s citizenship. Cuomo has called him a “terrorist sympathiser\".Masoud saw those attacks as a carefully calibrated “political tool”.“It’s an effort to change the understanding of the general public, to make people fear that is not the person they should vote for,” he said.Masoud added that as a business owner and landlord, he does carry reservations about Mamdani’s policies, including his support for rent freezes and for a $30 hourly minimum wage in the city.He’s not opposed to Mamdani’s vision, but hopes there “will be balance” if he is elected.Down the block, Marwa Janini, 34, heads the Arab American Association of New York, which does not endorse any candidate.For her, the last two years have been defined by two words: pain and pride.Pain over the atrocities in Gaza and an Islamophobic backlash fuelled in part by the Trump administration. Pride over the success of Mamdani and the message he carries.“As Muslim New Yorkers, our identities are not fixed; they’re fluid,” she said. “But for someone who grew up in post September 11 New York, with all the fear that created, this is huge.”“It is a big win for a visibly Muslim woman like myself,” she said, adding that her organisation had been targeted with hate messaging over the last two years, including a death threat pushed under the door.She hoped Mamdani’s victory could help to dispel some of those prejudices, especially if he shows he will be “mayor for all New Yorkers”.“To be in a city where we are possibly - inshallah - going to have a Muslim mayor,” she said, “it is a big deal.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Sutton's predictions v The Charlatans guitarist Mark Collins","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjek3new138o","message":"","news":"Brighton have won at Old Trafford in each of the past three seasons but can Manchester United get the better of them on Saturday?\"People get angry whenever I don't back United to win but why should I trust them?\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\"They got a great result against Liverpool last time out, but it would be typical of them to follow that by losing this game.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week nine, he takes on The Charlatans guitarist Mark Collins, who supports Manchester United.The Charlatans' 14th album, We Are Love, is out on 31 October and they tour the UK in December.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.We Are Love is The Charlatans' first album since Different Days, which reached number four in 2017. All 13 of their previous releases have made the UK top 40 and they have had three number onesCollins, who has been going to Old Trafford since he was growing up in the 1970s, once gave Gary Neville some guitar tips before the former United defender joined The Charlatans on stage.\"I saw Gary the other week and he actually mentioned that, but I am not sure there will be a repeat performance anytime soon,\" Collins told BBC Sport.\"He'd asked us to play a gig on the roof of Hotel Football [Neville's hotel next to Old Trafford] when it opened in 2015.\"We'd heard that he used to take a guitar with him when he was with England so we said we'd do it, if you play guitar with us.\"I went round and gave him a couple of lessons, then we watched a few videos of the tune he was going to play - Just When You're Thinkin' Things Over - and went through a few chord shapes and a few moves for when we got him on stage.\"So, was Gary any good on guitar? Could the Neville brothers rival those other famous Manchester siblings, the Gallaghers?\"He had a couple of chords he could play... but let's just say I covered for him!\" was Collins' verdict.Chris Sutton and Mark Collins were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Elland Road, 20:00 BSTWe know why Nuno Espirito Santo was brought in - to keep West Ham up - but it looks like it is going to be difficult for him.He is still waiting for his first win after three games as Hammers manager, and his side were quite lucky to only lose 2-0 against Brentford on Monday.Whenever I watch a team play as poorly as West Ham did then, I wonder how they will ever win a game.Leeds are not on a great run either, but I still feel like they've been competitive when I've seen them.Most people would probably go for a draw here - that's what I'm expecting from the readers anyway - but I actually think Leeds might edge this one.I have a feeling West Ham will score, because Jarrod Bowen is always dangerous, but I don't fancy them to keep a clean sheet even though sorting out their defence is probably Nuno's priority.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Mark's prediction: Neither of these teams are having a great time of it at the moment. They are both badly in need of a win, so this will probably be a draw. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Stamford Bridge, 15:00 BSTThis fixture does not hold too many good memories for me, because my Chelsea debut was against the Black Cats in 1999.They are terrible memories, actually, because I missed a couple of one-on-ones but at least it was a good team performance and I still got a win bonus... although thinking about it, they should have taken that off me.I am going for another Chelsea win this time too, even though Joao Pedro is in my Fantasy team and he is not scoring.They made lots of changes against Ajax on Wednesday but still won so emphatically.Enzo Maresca's side were not as convincing when they beat Forest last weekend and the 3-0 scoreline flattered them a bit, but after a bit of a wobble in September, they have now won four in a row in all competitions.Sunderland are extremely well organised but I'd still fancy Chelsea to find a way through - which is probably bad news for Blues supporters.I don't want to sound too negative about how my predictions are going, but I got Sunderland wrong every week even when I was doing well, and at the moment I am doing badly.I am going to write the Black Cats off again now though because I think we are already at the stage where their fans want me to. They know it means there is a good chance of them winning.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Mark's prediction: When we played Sunderland they did ok, but Chelsea will have too much for them. 2-0AI's prediction: 2-1St James' Park, 15:00 BSTI nearly always back Newcastle to win at home, even after they've just played in the Champions League, and I feel pretty confident about their chances here too.Eddie Howe's side played well against Benfica in midweek and while I think Fulham are a well-organised team who are capable of going to St James' Park and winning - like they did last season - they are not in great form at the moment.Sutton's prediction: 3-1Mark's prediction: There's not much between these two teams either. They both lost last weekend, so let's go for another draw. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Old Trafford, 17:30 BSTUnited were lucky with their first goal against Liverpool last week because the game should have been stopped, and we've all seen the issues with the Liverpool backline this season too.So, while I understand why any win for United against their rivals at Anfield is a massive result, it doesn't mean they have cracked it and turned a corner.They have just managed back-to-back league wins for the first time since Ruben Amorim took charge last November, but I am not looking at them and thinking they will make it a hat-trick on Saturday.Brighton striker Danny Welbeck impressed me when he came on the Monday Night Club this week and I am backing his boys here.The Seagulls are always bold under Fabian Hurzeler and they will be fearless at Old Trafford too. I am backing Welbeck to get one of their goals, and haunt his former club.It is down to United to prove me wrong, and show everyone they do have the consistency they have been lacking, and that may well be part of Amorim's team talk.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Mark's favourite United players: I loved the two wingers we had in the 1970s, Gordon Hill and Steve Coppell, and I always appreciated that kind of player who is exciting to watch.We've had a few of them down the years, like Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo and I was hoping Antony would be another one - but that didn't quite work out, did it? At the moment I am enjoying watching Bryan Mbeumo play. He's not explosive like the others I've mentioned but he's fitted in really nicely.Mark's prediction: I live in Portugal now but I am back in Cheshire for rehearsals this week and to go to this game, and United are going to put on a show for me!Brighton have done well every time they have come to Old Trafford recently, but I think United are going to show a bit of spirit. We are not going to take the foot off the pedal after beating Liverpool. We deserved that result, despite what Arne Slot was moaning about, and I feel like this is going to be a convincing win. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-1Gtech Community Stadium, 20:00 BSTLiverpool will probably be without Alexander Isak after he was injured against Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday.It feels like what has happened to him is a case of you reap what you sow. Isak has been short of full fitness and especially sharpness all season anyway, and he did not help himself there by missing training with Newcastle in order to try to force his move to Anfield through.He got what he wanted, but now he is trying to play catch-up instead of hitting the ground running because of the time he had off, and that is when you can pick up injuries.Isak is too good a player not to eventually start scoring goals but this whole situation has affected Liverpool as a team too, because his lack of fitness is one of the reasons they have not clicked in the final third yet.They scored a few goals against Frankfurt on Wednesday but this is going to be much harder for them.Brentford were more dominant on the ball when they beat West Ham on Monday but you know how Bees boss Keith Andrews will set up his team for this game - they will sit and then counter, and they are good at it.Liverpool's attack will click at some point, but I don't think it will happen here, and their vulnerability to direct balls in behind their defence means I don't see them keeping a clean sheet either.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Mark's prediction: Brentford will score and I'd love it if they nicked a last-minute goal that got them something, but Liverpool will probably win. I hope I'm wrong but they have to, don't they, otherwise Slot is going to get 'sacked in the morning' sung at him. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2Vitality Stadium, 14:00 BSTSean Dyche is a sensible appointment by Nottingham Forest but the way his predecessor Ange Postecoglou was treated by their fans makes me think he is better off out of there.Dyche is more of a Nuno Espirito Santo figure than an Ange in terms of how he will set his side up, but Forest's aim now is to stay in the Premier League and Dyche has already shown he can keep teams up.This is a tough start for him, though. Bournemouth should have beaten Crystal Palace last week but they are still third and are flying at the moment.The Cherries always create chances, especially at home, and I don't feel as if Forest will be able to hold out.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Mark's prediction: I know there is usually a bounce when you get a new manager but I don't see that happening here. Bournemouth are a really good team and I don't think Dyche will be able to turn things around that quickly. 2-0AI's prediction: 2-0Emirates Stadium, 14:00 BSTCrystal Palace have given Arsenal some trouble in the past but how can anyone back against Mikel Arteta's side at the moment? They are like a juggernaut, and not just because of their strength at set-pieces.Viktor Gyokeres got a couple of goals for the Gunners in the Champions League in midweek and I can see why Arteta raves about him.People may view Gyokeres as something of a flat-track bully but he is going to score some important goals for Arsenal, and he gives them something they previously lacked up front.If there is a side that can upset them at the moment, then it's Crystal Palace - I saw them absolutely tear Liverpool to shreds at Selhurst Park a few weeks ago.They did not lie down against Bournemouth last week either, but going to Emirates Stadium and hurting Arsenal still feels like a big ask.It doesn't help that Palace play in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, because their squad is not big enough for European football.Arsenal's squad is, and that is something else that will make a difference here.It is the Gunners' defence that impresses me the most at the moment, though.I am only half-joking when I say I am not going to back anyone to score against them in the league for the rest of the season, because it is their ability to keep clean sheets that will help them win the title.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Mark's prediction: Palace are a decent team but Arsenal are at home. It will be tight, but Arsenal will get over the line 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1Villa Park, 14:00 BSTWhat a phenomenal player Erling Haaland is.All the Fantasy Football talk at the start of the season was about Haaland versus Mohamed Salah, and on the FPL podcast I do with Alistair Bruce-Ball and Statman Dave, they both said 'Haaland? No chance' and they went with Salah as captain.Guess what they are doing now? They have copied me and got Haaland as captain, and so has everyone else. It is dull as anything because everyone in the world has done the same.We are at the stage now where we just expect him to score, the same as he does. He is like my old Blackburn strike partner Alan Shearer in that you just know it will happen.In fairness to Manchester City, they are more than just a one-man team. Phil Foden is looking sharp again and I love the signing of goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.Still, like City, Villa have won their past three league games so this is going to be a tough test for Pep Guardiola's side.City have lost on their past two visits to Villa Park and, while I don't see them getting turned over this time, they might have to settle for a point.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Mark's prediction: I'm going 5-0 to Villa! No, not really - I know they have picked up a bit recently after a terrible start, but I still think City will be too strong for them. Haaland is just unplayable at the moment. 0-2AI's prediction: 0-2Molineux, 14:00 BSTWolves have to win eventually and at home to Burnley feels like the game it really has to happen for them - their fans will definitely be thinking that.Burnley will be eyeing victory too, though. They will take great encouragement from their win over Leeds last time out, and they could do Wolves a lot of damage if they beat them.All things considered, it would be easy to go for a draw, but I am going to back Wolves to break their duck.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Mark's prediction: Wolves are struggling and I can see another draw here. This might be quite boring! 0-0AI's prediction: 2-1Hill Dickinson Stadium, 16:30 BSTTottenham have become a more versatile side under Thomas Frank, able to set up to suit the opposition, but I don't feel as if they are ever clinical enough in the final third.It is a similar story with Everton. I always feel they have a goal in them, just not from the centre-forward, whether it is Beto or Thierno Barry leading their attack.It must be frustrating for Toffees manager David Moyes but being realistic who can they attract, or afford, who would make a difference up front?All of that makes me think this is going to be a tight game, and I don't think there will be a winner.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Mark's prediction: Everton are doing pretty well at their new ground and are still unbeaten there, so I am going to back them to win. I actually hope they do because I don't like Spurs after they beat us in the Europa League final last season. I was in Bilbao for that, and it was a very disappointing night. 1-0AI's prediction: 0-1Chris got three correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 games played in week eight, giving him 60 points.That was enough for him to tie with the BBC readers, who also got three correct results with one exact score, and to out-do AI, which got four correct results without an exact score and ended up on 40 points.The weekly win went to the guests, Aya and Addison from CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson FC.Aya got three correct results without an exact score for a total of 30 points while Addison got seven correct results with one exact score for a tally of 100 - meaning their average of 65 points was enough for victory.Listen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePremier League news conferences: Delap back in training, Isak doubtful for BrentfordCan Arsenal's defence lead them to title glory?Rashford wants to stay at Barcelona when loan endsCan ready meal production be made greener?Joanna Lumley shares the music close to her heartRom-com starring Aimee Lou Wood and Nabhaan RizwanThe inventor who almost ended the worldCan Arsenal's defence lead them to title glory?'I was celebrating Grand Final when I got England call-up'Week of the wonderkids - who shone in Champions League?Weekly sports quiz: How many UCL goals has Rashford scored for Barca?Kane can't stop scoring - is the Ballon d'Or within reach?Ibiza, Lady Gaga, DIY & PWR - what the Red Roses did next'It can be living nightmare' - how UFC's Wood sought help for OCDWhy Messi's MLS legacy needs play-off triumph as he signs new dealDodgers v Blue Jays - five World Series talking points'Cleary's their general' - Morley's five Australia players to watchWhy rookies are shining in record start to NFL season'Being gay didn't feel normal, until I became a footballer'Meet the Sunday league team with 1,800 Premier League appearancesCan McLaren continue to play fair and stop Verstappen? - F1 Q&AVote for your BBC Women's Footballer of the YearWhat football can learn from NFL's international gamesThe ultimate Ashes competitor - Broad on walking, Warner and that final wicketConsign my Ashes try to history - Davies' England challengeCopyright © 2025 BBC.

Ice at Owen Park,” read another. “On our way,” one neighbor replied.The historic suburb quickly devolved into a scene that has become familiar to places like nearby Chicago and elsewhere across the country as President Donald Trump works to execute his Day 1 promise to crack down on immigration and crime: A Homeland Security helicopter whirred overhead, several SUVs and trucks with tinted windows drove slowly past houses, and around two dozen masked federal agents meandered through yards and walked down sidewalks, according to images and interviews with residents.Neighbors stepped out of their homes to document the agents who had descended on their community, joining a coalition of opposition to the president’s unwavering determination to detain and deport undocumented migrants en masse  – a resistance effort spreading throughout US cities that have seen their workers, schoolchildren and community members swept up in ICE raids.“The Rapid Response network confirmed high levels of immigration enforcement activity in Rolling Meadows, Wheeling, Prospect Heights & Mt. Prospect,” read a text from an ICE activity alert system run by a local immigrant rights group, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “At least 4 people have been detained.”Without knowing exactly where she was headed, Mount Prospect resident and small business owner Dawn Ardito grabbed her phone and driver’s license and rushed out the door after receiving some of the texts. She had reached only the end of her block before spotting the first set of SUVs with dark windows driven by men in masks and fatigues.She followed the cars to a nearby street with even more SUVs and agents. Ardito joined the handful of neighbors who had gathered, recording the federal officers with her phone, asking them what they were doing and demanding they leave.“You don’t belong here,” Ardito said she told immigration enforcement agents. “Our neighbors, they do belong here. Our community members, they do belong here.”Agents told residents they were looking for an “escaped criminal,” describing the person to Ardito and others as a “gang member” at one point, then a “murder suspect” and “sex offender” as the operation went on.CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the operation.Mount Prospect police said they encountered the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers while responding to a 911 call about a person running through a nearby backyard. Officers left after they “confirmed these were federal agents,” and didn’t participate in the operation, “as this would be in violation of Illinois State Law and the Trust Act,” Officer Greg Sill said in a statement.Another person living in Mount Prospect who was mobilized by the texts, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said she hoped to chase out the agents with her screams like she’d seen in videos on social media of similar encounters around Chicago.“People should be coming out of their houses and confronting (agents),” the resident said. “I have neighbors who are terrified to leave their houses. … Nobody should have to live like that, not in any neighborhood.”For more than an hour, residents screamed, videotaped and tailed federal vehicles, raucously honking horns to send the message: Their operation is not welcome here.Agents left the area after about two hours, neighbors said. It’s not clear whether agents arrested the person they told residents they were searching for.“If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere,” Ardito said. “Just because you haven’t seen it outside your front door like I saw it this weekend -– only time will tell until we all see that.”At “No Kings” protests, Latino independence celebrations or ordinary afternoons in the streets of Chicago, bright orange whistles swing from community members’ necks, ready to cut through the city’s bustle should federal immigration agents appear.The whistles have become a peaceful display of opposition as federal agents have been deployed across the city in recent weeks for what the Trump administration calls “Operation Midway Blitz,” an ICE effort that has resulted in more than 1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois between September 8 and October 3, according to the Department of Homeland Security.In Belmont Cragin, a northwest Chicago community, local organizers have rallied hundreds of volunteers to create kits packed with the whistles, handouts showing when to use them and bilingual flyers detailing what bystanders’ and detainees’ rights are when agents are conducting arrests.One pamphlet in the kit reads, “Form a crowd, stay loud,” instructing users to blow the whistles as they spot ICE activity to guide nearby Chicagoans to where the agents are patrolling or conducting arrests so they can make noise, document or follow agents’ caravans.Alonso Zaragoza, an organizer helping to run Belmont Cragin United, said the group has 30,000 whistle kits to distribute throughout the city. The group is hosting its next “Whistlemania” event October 29, when nearly 80 Chicago communities are expected to come together to fold pamphlets and pack plastic whistles to reach their goal of 100,000 kits.“Immigrants keep us moving forward. They’re the oil in the machine that is our community,” Zaragoza said. “Hopefully Whistlemania takes off in other communities, like in Portland, to protect their immigrant populations.”But many immigrants in Chicago now fear venturing out into the very community they help sustain.West 26th Street, in the predominantly Latino community of Little Village, once boasted an array of friendly street vendors selling shaved ice and fresh corn, with their carts dotting the busy road. Since “Operation Midway Blitz” launched, locals say street corners are emptier, and vendors who set up shop do so at their own risk.“Everybody who is getting arrested right now are people who are going to work,” said Erendira Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit. “Folks have to stay inside to stay safe.”Chicago resident Rick Rosales, a community organizer and co-founder of Cycling x Solidarity, a local cycling group dedicated to mutual aid, started raising money when raids began to ramp up to buy up all the vendors’ food to get them off the street for the day.Sunday morning, Rosales and a few other volunteers biked up to a woman selling empanadas in the pouring rain. On the street next to her tent, the woman’s young child was sitting in her parked car as she worked. The bikers bought every empanada she had.“She was incredibly grateful, very taken by surprise,” Rosales said. “And no sooner did we pack up the bikes with all her goods, she’s already packed up her cooler and tent. It’s cold, it’s raining, it’s early in the morning – she has a child, and now they get to go home.”After buying out a vendor, the bikers pass out the food to encampments and shelters.Rosales’ group works with the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, which typically helps vendors design menus and obtain permits, to fundraise and identify sellers. Together, the groups organize bike tours where riders buy from a series of vendors as they explore the city.“A few of our vendors have been detained (by ICE),” said Maria Orozco, outreach coordinator of the association. “So, we try to protect our vendors and make sure they’re good and make sure that the community supports them.”As attorneys face off in courtrooms and federal agents on the ground clash with residents, Chicago is being cemented as the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown after a flurry of legal developments.The Windy City was thrust into the national spotlight after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed the federalization of Illinois National Guard troops but blocked their deployment within the state.Trump on Friday urged the Supreme Court to allow him to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, putting the explosive legal fight over his ability to use those troops on American soil before the justices for the first time.The appeal uses striking language to describe the situation in Chicago, asserting federal officials there “have been threatened and assaulted, attacked in a harrowing pre-planned ambush involving many assailants.”That framing stands in stark contrast with how US District Court Judge April Perry described the situation on the ground in an order earlier this month.Perry, a Biden nominee, pointed to what she described as “a troubling trend of defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”Illinois and the city of Chicago have asked the justices to block the administration’s emergency request to keep National Guard troops in that state and have fiercely denied the administration’s descriptions of crime in the Prairie State’s biggest city.For residents in Chicago communities like Little Village and Belmont Cragin, and outside city limits in Mount Prospect and across Illinois, the work goes on.“I now have this whole new network of people that we have connected with, and having this firsthand experience, it has really bonded us,” Ardito said. “We are now making sure we’re connected and looking for what we can do to continue to protect our community and to continue to push back.”CNN’s Omar Jimenez contributed to this report.© 2025 Cable News Network.

The robbers are still at large, and the jewels have not been found.Here is what we know so far about where the jewellery could be, whether it can be traced and whether the robbers will be found.At 9:30am (07:30 GMT), a group of robbers used a truck-mounted ladder to reach the gilded Galerie d’Apollon (Apollo’s Gallery) on the second floor of the museum before taking an angle grinder to a window to access the French crown jewels. The heist took place about half an hour after the museum opened to the public.The stolen articles were:The robbers also stole a ninth item, the crown of Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. But it was recovered nearby, thought to have been dropped by the thieves, according to the French Ministry of the Interior.The haul of jewels is worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102m), Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau told RTL Radio on Tuesday.“It is important to remember that this damage is an economic damage, but it is nothing compared to the historical damage caused by this theft,” Beccuau said.This is not the first time the Louvre has been robbed. However, previous robberies have mostly involved the theft of paintings – for example, the Mona Lisa, which was stolen in 1911 – rather than jewels.“A jewellery theft is a very different thing to consider because of the high intrinsic value of the object stolen,” American art historian Noah Charney told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.“A painting doesn’t have a high intrinsic value because it’s usually made of panel and pigment, and canvas and nothing more. Whereas jewellery has a high intrinsic value because if you break down what was stolen and sell the components, the value is still significant,” Charney explained.The jewels are most likely still in France, Dutch art historian Arthur Brand told Al Jazeera.They could be sold on the black market, but this would reduce their value because of the high risk associated with being in possession of them.“They are very ‘hot’ and the price on the black market will be way below the regular market,” Brand said, estimating that the black market prices would be between 10 and 30 percent of their value. This means the $102m jewels could sell at between $10.2m and $30.6m on the black market.Charney said the thieves will not need to go to the black market at all if the jewels are recut significantly and no longer identifiable.However, re-cutting gems also reduces their value. If a thief tries to re-cut an antique diamond into a modern shape, they may lose some of the diamond’s size and value.“When jewels are stolen, either from homes or shops or museums, they’re usually taken from their settings and simply resold like any other gem. If the gems are especially large or otherwise identifiable, thieves will take them to a crooked lapidary to have them recut,” American art historian and lawyer Erin Thompson told Al Jazeera.  “The raw materials in these pieces are valuable, but worth much less than the pieces themselves, thanks to their historical value.”She cited the example of a gold toilet, an artwork stolen in 2019 from the United Kingdom’s Blenheim Palace. The gold itself was worth only two-thirds of what the artwork itself was worth. When the value is in the millions of dollars, that’s “a big loss – but it’s free money, so I suppose the thieves don’t really care,” Thompson said.And once the jewels, in the case of the Louvre robbery, are “divided up into several smaller stones, they will be untraceable”, she added.Thompson said the gems from the Louvre might end up in one of the world’s major stone-cutting centres, such as New York, Antwerp or Thailand.Brand, however, said, said that the thieves might alternatively, “try to sell the jewels in countries like India, Israel or Dubai [United Arab Emirates]”.“The thieves will get caught for sure. [The likelihood of] recovering the jewels is 50 percent – depends on the time it will take to arrest the thieves,” Brand said.Public prosecutors have tasked the BRB (Brigade de Repression du Banditisme – or the Banditry Repression Brigade), a specialised Paris police unit experienced in handling high-profile thefts, with investigating the heist.Police are expected to review surveillance camera footage going back weeks in an attempt to identify suspicious people in and around the premises.However, time is limited because if the jewels are recut, they will never be returned to their original form, even if the thieves are caught.“In thefts like this from museums, the people who actually enter the museum are almost always local career criminals who have been hired for the job. Thanks to surveillance cameras, DNA analysis and other investigative techniques, these thieves are almost always eventually apprehended,” Thompson said.“It’s proven much more difficult to catch the people who planned the job and hired them, though. I am betting that the people who entered the Louvre will be caught, but it’s unlikely that the pieces they stole will be recovered, since in most similar cases, the pieces are broken apart and the metal melted down within hours.”The Louvre robbery comes amid a recent spate of jewellery thefts from other museums in Europe. Recent incidents include:On September 30, a 24-year-old Chinese woman was arrested in Barcelona after stealing six gold nuggets from the Museum of Natural History in Paris. The gold nuggets were worth about 1.5 million euros ($1.74m).The woman was arrested while trying to dispose of melted gold – it is unclear who may have melted it. The museum’s alarms and security system had been disabled in a cyberattack, but it is also unclear whether the thieves were behind the cyberattack or whether the theft was opportunistic.In late January, thieves stole four artefacts, including three gold bracelets and a gold helmet that was estimated to be about 2,500 years old, from the Drents Museum in Assen, northeast Netherlands.The artefacts were part of an exhibit on the Dacians, an ancient society that once inhabited the land that is now Romania.In late July, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (PPS) announced that the investigation into the heist had concluded and three suspects had been identified. The suspects have been arrested and formally indicted, Dutch media reported. Their latest hearing was on October 16 at a court in Assen.The PPS did not give information about where the stolen items were located. In an update on May 9, it said it believed they had not been melted down and that the main suspects still had possession of them. “There is currently no information about whether there was an external client behind the theft,” the PPS said.On May 7, a gold torc and gold bracelet, dating back to the Bronze Age, were stolen from the Ely Museum, Cambridgeshire, in the United Kingdom.Later that month, independent charity Crimestoppers offered a 5,000-pound ($6,671) reward for information leading to the conviction of the thieves. There have not been updates on whether the thieves have been caught or the stolen items recovered.Thieves stole 483 ancient gold coins from the Celtic and Roman Museum in Manching, Bavaria. An official estimated that the coins were worth $1.7m, The New York Times reported at the time.In July this year, three men were convicted of the theft and sentenced to prison for up to 11 years. Most of the stolen coins remain unrecovered, however. Investigators did find lumps of gold on one suspect during his arrest, which indicated that some or all of the coins might have been melted down.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Food reviewer's 'hidden gems' gain 22 million likes","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze61nk1429o","message":"","news":"A TikToker who hopes to promote and shoutout \"hidden gems\" of hospitality has found an appetite for food reviewing with his almost one million followers.Alex Green, 26 from Norwich, has merged his full-time job with his passion in posting food reviews.Since he started posting videos about eateries in Norfolk and Suffolk more than two months ago he has amassed more than 920,000 followers and more than 22 million likes.He said: \"[I'm] just going around to local gems looking at the restaurants I think are worthy of a shoutout and trying to help promote as much as I can.

That’s where Meer, now 45, was born. Meer says that more than 200 members of his extended family made the journey from Afghanistan to Pakistan, which has been their home ever since.Over the past two years, as Pakistan has moved to send back hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, the family has feared for its future, but managed to evade Islamabad’s dragnet.Last week, the threat of expulsion hit home: Pakistan announced it would close all 54 Afghan refugee villages across the country as part of the campaign it began in 2023 to push out what it calls “illegal foreigners”. These include the villages in Kohat, where Meer and his family live.“In my life, I visited Afghanistan only once, for two weeks in 2013. Apart from that, none of my family have ever gone back,” Meer told Al Jazeera. “How can I uproot everything when we were born here, lived here, married here, and buried our loved ones here?”Amid heightened tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban, which returned to governing Afghanistan in 2021, families like Meer’s are caught in a vortex of uncertainty.Fighting erupted between Afghan and Pakistani forces along the border earlier in October, pushing already strained relations into open hostility. On Sunday, officials from both sides met in Qatar’s capital, Doha, and signed a ceasefire agreement, with the next round of talks scheduled in Istanbul on October 25.Yet, tensions remain high. And families like Meer’s fear that they could become diplomatic pawns in a border war between the neighbours.Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As civil war gripped Afghanistan and the Taliban first rose to power in 1996, successive waves of Afghans fled across the border.After the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 following the September 11 attacks on the US, the Taliban’s fall prompted thousands of Afghans to return home. But their return was short-lived.The Taliban’s stunning comeback in August 2021 triggered yet another exodus, when another 600,000 to 800,000 Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan.However, as relations between Kabul and Islamabad soured during the past four years, Pakistan – which was once the Taliban’s principal patron  – accused Afghanistan of harbouring armed groups responsible for the cross-border attacks. The government’s stance hardened towards Afghan refugees, even those who have lived in the country for decades – like Meer.A father of 10, Meer earned a degree in education from a university in Peshawar, and now runs a vocational training project for Afghan refugee children backed by the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR.Since 2006, the UNHCR has issued what are known as Proof of Registration (PoR) cards to document Afghan citizens living in Pakistan. These cards have allowed them to stay in Pakistan legally, giving them some freedom of movement, although this is restricted, as well as access to some public services, including bank accounts.But from June 30 this year, the Pakistani government has stopped renewing PoR cards and has invalidated existing ones.“We all possess the UNHCR-issued Proof of Residence cards, but now, with this current drive, I don’t know what will happen,” Meer said.In 2017, Pakistan also started issuing Afghan Citizenship Cards (ACC) to undocumented Afghan nationals living in the country, giving them identification credentials to provide them with a temporary legal status.But the ACC is not a protection against deportation any more.According to the UNHCR, more than 1.5 million Afghans left Pakistan – voluntarily or forcibly – between the start of the campaign in 2023 and mid-October, 2025.About 1.2 million PoR cardholders, 737,000 ACC holders and 115,000 asylum seekers  remain in Pakistan, Qaiser Khan Afridi, the UNHCR’s spokesperson in Pakistan, told Al Jazeera.Pakistan’s tensions with the Taliban have added new precarity to their status.“For over 45 years, Pakistan has shown extraordinary generosity by hosting millions of Afghan refugees,” Afridi said. “But we are deeply concerned by the government’s decision to de-notify refugee villages all over Pakistan and to push for returns [to Afghanistan].”“Many of those affected have lived here for years, and now fear for their future. We urge that any return should be voluntary, gradual, and carried out with dignity and safety.”Meer, who has volunteered for the UNHCR over the years, said that seven refugee villages in Kohat alone house more than 100,000 people. He accused both Pakistan and Afghanistan of using the refugee issue as political leverage.“With the latest situation, our family elders have sat together to discuss options. We thought about sending some of our young men to Afghanistan to look for houses and means to do business, but the problem is, we have no connections there at all,” he said.With his PoR card now invalidated by the Pakistani government, he has no recognised identity card, making it hard for him to access even medical facilities when his children need treatment for any illness.“We are, for all practical purposes, considered illegal in a country that I and my children call home,” he said.Pakistan’s plan to expel Afghan residents began in late 2023, amid a rise in rebe attacks. Since then, violence has surged, with 2025 shaping up to be the most violent year in a decade.Pakistani authorities argue Afghan refugees pose a security risk, accusing the Taliban government of sheltering armed groups, a charge Kabul denies.Two years ago, Pakistan’s then interior minister, Sarfraz Bugti, alleged that 14 out of 24 suicide bombings in the country in 2023 were carried out by Afghan nationals. He did not provide any evidence to back his claim, and he did not clarify if the individuals were refugees living in Pakistan, or Afghan nationals who had crossed the porous border between the two countries.But Meer fears that Afghan refugees in Pakistan will be distrusted back in Afghanistan, too, given the climate of animosity between the neighbours.“We will be seen as Pakistanis, as enemies there, too,” he said.Afridi, the UNHCR spokesperson, urged Pakistan to reconsider its repatriation drive.“UNHCR calls on the government to apply measures to exempt Afghans with international protection needs from involuntary return,” he said.“Pakistan has a proud history of hospitality, and it’s important to continue that tradition at this critical time,” he said.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Millions of UK Apple users could get pay-out after court ruling","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkzg3mkgx6o","message":"","news":"Apple could be forced to pay up to £1.5bn in damages after losing a collective legal action court case brought on behalf of 36 million UK iPhone and iPad users, both consumers and businesses.The Competition Appeals Tribunal found that Apple had abused its dominant position by charging \"excessive and unfair\" prices in the form of the 30% commission, which it usually levies both on app sales and in-app payments.The claimants argued that this meant that consumers had been overcharged for apps, subscriptions to apps, and when buying digital content in apps.Apple said it strongly disagreed with the ruling and would appeal.The case was pursued by academic Dr Rachael Kent.Her lawyers argue it is the first such claim brought under the UK's collective action regime to have succeeded.Dr Kent called the decision a \"landmark victory, not only for App Store users, but for anyone who has ever felt powerless against a global tech giant\".\"Today's ruling sends a clear message: no company, however wealthy or powerful, is above the law.\"The tribunal's decision comes a day after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) designated both Apple and Google as having \"strategic market status\" - effectively saying they have a lot of power over mobile platforms.It means the competition watchdog could force Apple to allow rivals to operate their own app stores on iPhones in the UK.This would be a significant change to Apple's \"closed system\", where apps can only be downloaded from its own App Store.Apple maintains that because commission is only charged on the sale of paid apps and on in-app purchases, 85% of apps on the App Store do not pay any commission at all.And it points to its introduction of a programme for small businesses where the usual 30% rate of commission is halved.In a statement sent to the BBC, Apple wrote that it strongly disagreed with the ruling, which took a flawed view of the \"thriving and competitive app economy\".The App Store had benefited businesses and consumers across the UK, it said, and had created a dynamic marketplace where developers compete and users could choose from millions of innovative apps.\"This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments,\" Apple said.Adding: \"The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections\".Apple said it intended to appeal.According to lawyers Hausfeld & Co. LLP, who represented Dr Kent, \"any UK user of an iPhone or iPad who purchased paid-for apps, subscriptions or made in-app purchases of digital content within the UK storefront of the App Store at any point since 1 October 2015 is potentially entitled to compensation from Apple\".The purchases must have been made on iPhone and/or iPad devices, they add.But it has it has yet to be established exactly how much eligible individual consumers or businesses may be able to claim, the BBC has been told.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The study by King's College London and the University of Oxford is the first to produce a ranking so the effects of medicines can be easily compared.The team analysed 151 studies of 30 drugs commonly used in depression, involving more than 58,500 patients.Not everybody develops side effects but, on average, the results published in the Lancet medical journal showed:\"Clearly no two antidepressants are built the same,\" said Dr Atheeshaan Arumuham, from King's College London.Those differences can stack up in ways that become clinically important, including an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.It means even people with the same diagnosis could be better suited to different antidepressants depending on their own preferences and other health conditions.Dr Toby Pillinger told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The majority of the studies we looked at were relatively short. We're looking at eight weeks' duration and still within that duration we were seeing large changes in physical health parameters which we would argue have clinical relevance.\"The last thing I want is for this story to be scaring people,\" he added.\"I want to see this as empowering individuals to take the initiative and to engage  in shared decision-making with their practitioner.\"In a hypothetical scenario, Sarah, 32, John, 44, and Jane, 56, have all received the same depression diagnosis and have been recommended antidepressants.But they each want to avoid different side effects.For Sarah, the priority is avoiding weight gain, while John already has high blood pressure and Jane has raised cholesterol.Dr Pillinger, who worked through the examples for the BBC, says each would be recommended a different medicine.Dr Toby Pillinger says: Sarah should have an antidepressant that avoids weight gain, such as agomelatine, sertraline or venlafaxine rather than amitriptyline or mirtazapine which are more likely to increase weight.Dr Toby Pillinger says: John should avoid drugs such as venlafaxine, amitriptyline or nortriptyline which raise blood pressure, and would be better suited to citalopram, escitalopram and paroxetine.Dr Toby Pillinger says: For Jane, some antidepressants are linked to higher cholesterol, including venlafaxine, duloxetine and paroxetine, so she might steer clear of those. Citalopram or escitalopram are more neutral on cholesterol and could suit her better.It is too simplistic to say there are good and bad antidepressants, the researchers say. Even though amitriptyline increases weight, heart rate and blood pressure it also helps with pain and struggling to sleep.Overall, the most prescribed class of antidepressants - SSRIs such as paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline - tended to have fewer physical side effects.Fluoxetine - an SSRI that is also called Prozac - was linked to a drop in weight and higher blood pressure, in the study.Prof Andrea Cipriani from the University of Oxford said it was \"impossible\" to say how many of the millions of people being prescribed antidepressants should be on a different drug.However, he said there had been a push for \"generic, cheap medications\" that meant 85% of antidepressant prescriptions in the UK were for just three drugs: the SSRIs citalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine.He said implementing the findings of this report would see \"the 85% reduce dramatically\" with \"more people accessing better treatments\".The researchers are developing a free online tool to help doctors and patients choose the right drug.However, that would still require a significant change in culture within the NHS.The study also only analysed what happened eight weeks after starting treatment. Dr Pillinger said \"complimentary data\" meant they expected the short-term changes \"will persist\" but this still needs to be properly tested.Dr Prasad Nishtala, from the University of Bath which was not involved in the study, said the findings were \"novel and valuable\".He said: \"In a real-world setting, where patients often receive antidepressants for months or years, the cumulative risks are likely to be higher, particularly among those with chronic depression.\"Care Quality Commission warns GP, mental health and social care services lacking staff and capacity.Ashley Cohen, who runs sites in Leeds and York, warns deprived areas are worst affected by closures.The health secretary says he will \"find out what has gone wrong\" with plans for Great Western ParkAlvan Whittaker's hidden disability Adult-onset Still's Disease causes him constant pain.Six-year-old Jack uses a wheelchair after being diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Then it collapsed.By Yashraj SharmaShareSavePlans for an in-person meeting between United States President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the next two weeks in Budapest, Hungary, fell apart on Tuesday, after Trump proposed “freezing” the Russia-Ukraine war with a ceasefire along the current front lines.Apparently signalling that no meeting would take place anytime soon, Trump told the media at the White House on Tuesday: “I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time, so I’ll see what happens.”The latest derailing of peace talks to bring an end to Russia’s 42-month-long war on Ukraine comes just two months after Trump and Putin met at a hastily arranged summit in Alaska in August this year that also did not yield any results.The largest and deadliest war in Europe since World War II has killed tens of thousands of people on both sides.So, why have plans for talks collapsed yet again, and what will it take for Russia to end the war?During his presidential campaign last year, Trump boasted that it would take him just “24 hours” to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. More than a year later – and 10 months into his second term as US president – he is now growing increasingly frustrated about the lack of progress.Putin has called for the complete disarmament of Ukraine and for Russia to keep any territory it has seized during the war if it is to agree to a ceasefire. Ukraine has baulked at the notion of ceding land, and Trump has been unable to make any headway between the two positions.Late on Sunday, Trump called on Russia to, instead, “freeze” the war along current battle lines, adding that the two sides could aim to resolve the “details” over territory at future talks.“What I say is they should stop right now at the battle lines, go home, stop killing people and be done,” the US president said.The current front line runs through the Donbas region, an industrial hub which has endured most of the fighting. On the region’s future, Trump said: “Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now – I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now. They can negotiate something later on down the line.”Yes. A statement signed by European leaders, including Zelenskyy, on Tuesday said they “strongly” supported Trump’s proposal to stop the fighting immediately, and that “the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations”.The leaders accused the Russian president of stalling the peace process. “Russia’s stalling tactics have shown time and time again that Ukraine is the only party serious about peace,” the statement said. “We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction.”The leaders also pledged to “ramp up the pressure on Russia’s economy and its defence industry, until Putin is ready to make peace”.On Monday, before plans for a Trump-Putin meeting collapsed, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made clear that the Russian leader would not acquiesce to the latest proposal to “freeze” the war. He said “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change”, referring to its insistence on hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.On Tuesday, the Reuters news agency reported that Russia had also sent a private communique to the US “over the weekend”, demanding control of all of Ukraine’s Donbas region – not just the parts it has already seized.Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio by telephone on Tuesday, and later told reporters in Moscow that he had conveyed that Moscow “has not changed its position compared to the understandings that were reached during the Alaska summit”.Lavrov reiterated Putin’s Alaska summit position, noting that Russia would agree to end the war only after eliminating the “primary causes” of the conflict – meaning the disarming of Ukraine and the ceding of territory lost to Russia during the war.That is unacceptable to Kyiv.Yes. Trump has repeatedly shifted his position while attempting to mediate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.While the previous US administration, under President Joe Biden, expressed unflinching support for Ukraine, the Trump administration took a hard line with Zelenskyy during a meeting at the Oval Office in Washington, DC, in February this year. During a fiery exchange, Trump and Vice President JD Vance admonished Zelenskyy for not expressing enough gratitude to the US for the help it has already provided.In March, Trump threatened sweeping secondary tariffs and sanctions against Moscow – and repeated this threat in August. But when he later met Putin in Alaska in August, he appeared to be pressuring Zelenskyy to accept a deal, even as the Kremlin demanded that Ukraine cede territories and keep away from NATO.“There’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump told reporters, insisting that both sides would need to cede territories.Switching tack yet again the following month, Trump appeared to again back the Ukrainian president, when he stated that Kyiv could win back its territories – or “maybe even go further than that”.Mostly, more uncertainty. The collapse of the planned summit means that, for now, there is no end to the Russia-Ukraine war in sight.Last week, Zelenskyy was again at the White House, as he pressed his demand for the supply of US Tomahawk missiles, hoping it would equip Kyiv to hit targets deep inside Russian territory. He did not secure that agreement.Trump had expressed openness to the idea previously; however, he backtracked from that possibility during the meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday.Zelenskyy has also been pressing the White House to increase military support generally, but Trump has previously signalled that Ukraine’s European allies in NATO should be the ones to take a more proactive role.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Trump administration to open up Alaska wildlife refuge to drilling","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/trump-administration-to-open-up-alaska-wildlife-refuge-to-drilling","message":"","news":"It said the ‘sweeping package’ would ‘boost energy development, modernise land and resource management’ in Alaska.By News AgenciesShareSaveThe Trump administration has finalised plans to allow oil and gas drilling in a national wildlife refuge spanning pristine Indigenous land in Alaska, reigniting long-simmering tensions about conserving one of the United States’s environmental jewels.The US Department of the Interior announced at an event on Thursday that it plans to open up the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which sits on traditional Inupiaq and Gwich’in Indigenous land, to resource exploration.In a news release, it said the move, which paves the way for lease sales within the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre (631,309-hectare) coastal plain, was part of a “sweeping package of actions to boost energy development, modernise land and resource management across Alaska”.President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans previously pledged to reopen this portion of the refuge to possible development.Announcing the move, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said, “from day one, President Trump directed us to unlock Alaska’s energy and resource potential while honouring commitments to the state and local communities”.A Republican bill featuring major tax breaks and spending cuts, passed during the summer, called for at least four lease sales within the Alaska refuge over a 10-year period.“By reopening the Coastal Plain and advancing key infrastructure, we are strengthening energy independence, creating jobs and supporting Alaska’s communities while driving economic growth across the state,” Burgum said.The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain – which sits near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, and contains internationally recognised habitat for migrating waterfowl – is considered sacred land to Indigenous Gwich’in communities, who oppose the drilling.Conservationists have also condemned the move. Meda DeWitt, Alaska senior manager with The Wilderness Society, said it places “corporate interests above the lives, cultures and spiritual responsibilities of the people whose survival depends on … the health of the Arctic Refuge”.Supportive of the drilling, however, are the Inupiaq Indigenous community in the town of Kaktovik, which sits within the refuge. They consider responsible oil development to be key to their region’s economic wellbeing and development.The Kaktovik Inupiat Corp, the native village corporation founded in 1973 that owns the land in and around Kaktovik, praised this week’s announcement from the Trump administration.“It is encouraging to see decision makers in Washington advancing policies that respect our voice and support Kaktovik’s long term success,” its president, Charles “CC” Lampe, said in a statement.In Thursday’s announcement, Burgum also said a land exchange deal had been completed aimed at building a road connecting the communities of King Cove and Cold Bay that would run through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.While King Cove residents have long called for a road to be opened, conservationists and tribal leaders have promised to launch a legal challenge.Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters she had been fighting for land access for King Cove throughout her tenure, but said it was in everyone’s interest to ensure the road is built with minimal disturbance to local wildlife.“I think it’s important to remember that nobody’s talking about a multi-lane paved road moving lots of big trucks back and forth,” she said. “It is still an 11-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Top Border Patrol official accused of violating judge’s order by throwing tear gas at Chicago protesters","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/gregory-bovino-chicago-immigration-tear-gas-hnk","message":"","news":"Senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is accused of throwing at least one tear gas canister into a crowd of protesters in a Chicago neighborhood Thursday in a potential violation of a judge’s order restricting federal agents from using aggressive crowd control tactics during anti-ICE protests.A new court filing against the Department of Homeland Security alleges Bovino “apparently threw tear gas into a crowd without justification” during a protest against federal immigration authorities in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood.The notice of alleged violation was filed by a combination of media groups, individual protesters and Chicago-area clergy members who earlier this month obtained a temporary restraining order from US District Judge Sara Ellis after suing DHS and Trump officials over federal agents’ tactics against protesters.The filing cites a Facebook video post that shows Bovino throw an object toward protesters Thursday morning. The video, which CNN has viewed, does not show clearly what happened in the minutes leading up to the alleged incident or if any warnings were given.“Defendant Bovino appears to throw either one or two tear gas canisters over the heads of armed federal agents in front of him and in the direction of a crowd of individuals protesting, including an individual filming the encounter,” the filing from Thursday states.Ellis’ sweeping order restricts agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists and others at protests in Chicago, but it includes exceptions for individuals who pose a threat to law enforcement or others. During a hearing last week, she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.Bovino is one of more than a dozen administration officials named as defendants in the lawsuit filed earlier this month, which accuses federal agents of “a pattern of extreme brutality” intended to “silence the press and civilians.”CNN has reached out to DHS for comment.Hours before the court filing alleging a possible violation of the judge’s order, Bovino defended federal agents’ conduct in the Chicago area during an interview with CBS News.“The use of force I’ve seen has been exemplary. By exemplary, I would say the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,” Bovino said, in response to attacks he’s seen carried out on federal agents by “extremists and others.”Protests in Chicago have ramped up since federal agents were deployed on the city’s streets early September during what the Trump administration has titled “Operation Midway Blitz,” a targeted crackdown on illegal immigration that has led to over 1,000 arrests.Federal agents’ response to the demonstrations has drawn widespread outcry, notably when an area pastor was seen on video being shot in the head with pepper balls by officers perched on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility near Chicago.On Thursday, Bovino insisted such tactics do not necessarily violate DHS policy, telling CBS: “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that’s on them. Don’t protest, and don’t trespass.”Ellis has ordered Bovino be deposed in the case and a preliminary injunction hearing is set for November 5. On Thursday, the court expanded Bovino’s deposition time to five hours.‘There is no sanctuary here’: Meet the Border Patrol chief in charge of Trump’s Chicago crackdownBovino, 55, has emerged as the on-the-ground face of President Donald Trump’s effort to surge federal law enforcement into Democrat-led states and cities regardless of whether local officials want them there.Bovino, who formally heads Border Patrol’s El Centro sector in California, has been leading the federal crackdown in Chicago after helming similar operations in Los Angeles earlier this year.His heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled consternation among some in the Trump administration while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.On Thursday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced the creation of the Illinois Accountability Commission “to pursue accountability for the people of Illinois,” amid the surge in federal immigration enforcement in his state.The commission is charged with creating a public record of federal enforcement abuses, capturing the impact of the enforcements on families and communities in Illinois, and recommending actions to “prevent further harm and to pursue justice,” Pritzker said.Criticism over federal authorities’ tactics in Chicago comes amid the broader legal battle over Trump’s push to deploy National Guard troops in the city.On Wednesday, US District Court Judge April Perry ordered an extension of the order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Chicago through final judgment.

Four haircare myths get the chop","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lkrnzpzl1o","message":"","news":"We all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands.In an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair.Ever shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair?Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair.\"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.If you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"You may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all.But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\"Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too.Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.Finding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower.Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes.The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out.\"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says.\"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.Copyright 2025 BBC.

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos, in compliance with our policy.It’s day 25. You wake up in your bunk pod in a snow-capped Martian landscape, far from civilization. Outside it’s -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit). After meditating and eating a breakfast of freeze-dried dumplings, you and your six-person crew don space suits over your thermal underwear and head out into the sandstorm on a mission.This isn’t a fever dream. It’s a month-long survival challenge deep in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert that’s designed to simulate life on Mars — for tourists.The project, called the MARS-V Project, is under development by MARS-V, a non-governmental organization based in Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar. They’re working to build a fully-fledged Mars analog station in the Gobi to prepare for human travel to the red planet — and expect to welcome the first tourists to the mock Mars camp by 2029.Nowhere on Earth mimics the geography and climate of Mars more closely than Mongolia’s Gobi. An arid, barren landscape with extreme temperature swings from 45 to -40 degrees Celsius (113 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit). The iron oxide-tinted soil has a reddish hue,  making it look eerily Martian.This combination of isolation, altitude and temperature is what makes the site so scientifically valuable as a training ground for scientists and astronauts — and as a test site for equipment and rovers.For MARS-V, it also offers another potential: tourism.“Your objective is to survive in an environment that is very, very isolated,’ says Enkhtuvshin Doyodkhuu, MARS-V CEO. “You have to have this simulation mindset that you’re on another planet: you need to feel that if you don’t follow protocol, you die.”Each participant will have to pass physical, psychological and mental agility tests, then undergo a three-month virtual astronaut training program on everything from oxygen protocol to the psychology of isolation.Once you arrive in Mongolia, it’s three days of in-person drills in Ulaanbaatar with your new teammates before handing in your phone and beginning the ten-hour journey by bumpy road to the site, drifting away from civilization across stretches of pale-red dust.“It’s surreal,” says Doyodkhuu. “This feeling of vastness, of endless empty space — the Gobi really gives you that “Mad Max” kind of feeling. It’s beautiful if you think about it, but it can be overwhelming to some.”Your home for the month? Mars “habitats” — interconnected modular pods with living quarters, a laboratory, and a greenhouse. Each day begins with the same strict daily regimen that real astronauts might face: vitamins, meditation, exercise, breakfast, and a team briefing for the day ahead.“Meditation has to be a big part of the program,” says Doyodkhuu. “One very risky thing when it comes to Mars pioneers is we don’t really know what’s going to happen with their psychology, because no other person has been away from Earth that long.”Doyodkhuu says the Mars simulation for tourists could have a similar psychological effect.“You’ll have this sort of claustrophobia; you’ll miss your Earth.”Days at the Mars-V camp are filled with challenges and tasks: for example, the crew might take the rover out to conduct geological mapping or collect soil samples. Communication with “Earth” (the Mars-V mission support team) happens on a timed delay to mimic interplanetary lag. Simulations take place between October and March in brutal winter conditions, when the Gobi freezes solid.Riding the Trans-Mongolian Railway, one of the world’s most epic train journeys“Minus 27 degrees Celsius (-16.6 degrees Fahrenheit) would be a warm day,” laughs the CEO. Crews wear thermal base layers, overalls, and analog spacesuits when working outdoors.To make it as realistic as possible, the team from Mars-V will hide all external support out of sight.“Compared to an Arctic expedition, this is controlled,” Doyodkhuu says. “If there was any real chance of death, we’d stop the simulation.”Meals will feature freeze-dried Mongolian dishes — like rehydrated dumplings or mutton stews — designed to mimic astronaut rations while honoring local culture.There’s even a design echo between the nomadic Mongolian ger — the traditional felt tent sometimes referred to as yurts — and the Martian dome prototypes being developed by the MARS-V engineering team.“We [Mongolians] have thousands of years of history living in isolated places, with very limited resources,” Doyodkhuu explains. “We’re just taking that idea to another planet.”The idea of trialing planetary life on Earth isn’t new. NASA and ESA have long used analog sites for experiments and training.But MARS-V’s plan to merge scientific research with tourism arrives at a pivotal moment: private space travel is finally edging into the mainstream. SpaceX and Blue Origin are drawing celebrities like Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, and Kim Kardashian into a new era of luxury space tourism.But, for those who can’t afford a $28 million ticket to space, Mongolia’s MARS-V camp will offer a more accessible way to experience that cosmic allure at a fraction of the cost, expected to be around $6,000 per person for a month at the camp, and pre-camp training and evaluation.It’s Mars tourism, without the launch cost — or the suffocating risk of decompression.MARS-V’s analog station is in the early stages of development, with designs for the habitat, space suits and food completed. Doyodkhuu says they expect the habitats to be ready and open to the public within the next two to three years.For those drawn to the idea of other planets, MARS-V promises a glimpse of a Martian future.“You have a lot of time to think out there,” says Doyodkhuu. “Being in this otherworldly place for one month trying to survive with five other people, it gives you this renewed outlook on life.”“If you believe that humans will become a multiplanetary species in the future, actually being part of this history, going to an analog astronaut training center and  challenging yourself, is going to leave a big impact on people.”For the right traveler — whether thrill-seeker, explorer or space enthusiast — it may be the ultimate holiday. But if the thought of freezing cold isolation and bunk pods sounds more like punishment than adventure, Mongolia’s Gobi already offers glimpses of the otherworldly in a far more comfortable setting.This remote eco-lodge offers travelers a rare opportunity to experience Mongolia’s GobiDuring the summer at the Gobi’s luxury Three Camel Lodge, travelers can switch thermals for a spa towel and freeze-dried stews for an extensive whiskey selection. You will still need to strap in for the journey though, it takes 7-8 hours to reach the lodge from Ulaanbaatar. This is after all one of the most remote places on Earth - and perhaps the closest you can get to Mars, without leaving the planet.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

In a poor country, that amounts to punishing women, say critics – simply for being women. Omer is trying to get the government to scrap that ‘period tax’.By Vania AliShareSaveGrowing up in Rawalpindi, a city adjacent to Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, Mahnoor Omer remembers the shame and anxiety she felt in school when she had periods. Going to the toilet with a sanitary pad was an act of stealth, like trying to cover up a crime.“I used to hide my pad up my sleeve like I was taking narcotics to the bathroom,” says Omer, who comes from a middle-class family – her father a businessman and her mother a homemaker. “If someone talked about it, teachers would put you down.” A classmate once told her that her mother considered pads “a waste of money”.“That’s when it hit me,” says Omer. “If middle-class families think this way, imagine how out of reach these products are for others.”Now 25, Omer has gone from cautious schoolgirl to national centrestage in a battle that could reshape menstrual hygiene in Pakistan, a country where critics say economics is compounding social stigma to punish women – simply for being women.In September, Omer, a lawyer, petitioned the Lahore High Court, challenging what she and many others say is effectively a “period tax” imposed by Pakistan on its more than 100 million women.Pakistani governments have, under the Sales Tax Act of 1990, long charged an 18 percent sales tax on locally manufactured sanitary pads and a customs tax of 25 percent on imported ones, as well as on raw materials needed to make them. Add on other local taxes, and UNICEF Pakistan says that these pads are often effectively taxed at about 40 percent.Omer’s petition argues that these taxes – which specifically affect women – are discriminatory, and violate a series of constitutional provisions that guarantee equality and dignity, elimination of exploitation and the promotion of social justice.In a country where menstruation is already a taboo subject in most families, Omer and other lawyers and activists supporting the petition say that the taxes make it even harder for most Pakistani women to access sanitary products. A standard pack of commercially branded sanitary pads in Pakistan currently costs about 450 rupees ($1.60) for 10 pieces. In a country with a per capita income of $120 a month, that’s the cost of a meal of rotis and dal for a low-income family of four. Cut the cost by 40 percent – the taxes – and the calculations become less loaded against sanitary pads.At the moment, only 12 percent of Pakistani women use commercially produced sanitary pads, according to a 2024 study by UNICEF and the WaterAid nonprofit. The rest improvise using cloth or other materials, and often do not even have access to clean water to wash themselves.“If this petition goes forward, it’s going to make pads affordable,” says Hira Amjad, the founder and executive director of Dastak Foundation, a Pakistani nonprofit whose work is focused on promoting gender equality and combating violence against women.And that, say lawyers and activists, could serve as a spark for broader social change.The court docket describes the case as Mahnoor Omer against senior officials of the government of Pakistan. But that’s not what it feels like to Omer.“It feels like women versus Pakistan.”Bushra Mahnoor, founder of Mahwari Justice, a Pakistani student-led organisation whose name translates to “menstrual justice”, realised early just how much of a struggle it could be to access sanitary pads.Mahnoor – no relation to Omer – grew up in Attock, a city in the northwestern part of Pakistan’s Punjab province, with four sisters. “Every month, I had to check if there were enough pads. If my period came when one of my sisters had hers too,” finding a pad was a challenge, she says.The struggle continued in school, where, as was the case with Omer, periods were associated with shame. A teacher once made one of her classmates stand for two entire lectures because her white uniform was stained. “That was dehumanising,” she says.Mahnoor was 10 when she had her first period. “I didn’t know how to use a pad. I stuck it upside down; the sticky side touched my skin. It was painful. No one tells you how to manage it.”She says that shame was never hers alone, but it’s part of a silence which starts at home and accompanies girls into adulthood. A study on menstrual health in Pakistan shows that eight out of 10 girls feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when talking about periods, and two out of three girls report never having received information about menstruation before it began. The findings, published in the Frontiers in Public Health journal in 2023, link this silence to poor hygiene, social exclusion and missed school days.In 2022, when floods devastated Pakistan, Mahnoor began Mahwari Justice to ensure that relief camps did not overlook the menstrual needs of women. “We began distributing pads and later realised there’s so much more to be done,” she says. Her organisation has distributed more than 100,000 period kits – each containing pads, soap, underwear, detergent and painkillers – and created rap songs and comics to normalise conversations about menstruation. “When you say the word ‘mahwari’ out loud, you’re teaching people it’s not shameful,” she says. “It’s just life.”The same floods also influenced Amjad, the Dastak Foundation founder, though her nonprofit has been around for a decade now. Its work now also includes distributing period kits during natural disasters.But the social stigma associated with menstruation is also closely tied to economics in the ways in which its impact plays out for Pakistani women, suggests Amjad.“In most households, it’s the men who make financial decisions,” she says. “Even if the woman is bringing the money, she’s giving it to the man, and he is deciding where that money needs to go.”And if the cost of women’s health feels too high, that’s often compromised. “[With] the inflated prices due to the tax, there is no conversation in many houses about whether we should buy pads,” she says. “It’s an expense they cannot afford organically.”According to the 2023 study in the Frontiers in Public Health, over half of Pakistani women are not able to afford sanitary pads.If the taxes are removed, and menstrual hygiene becomes more affordable, the benefits will extend beyond health, says Amjad.School attendance rates for girls could improve, she said. Currently, more than half of Pakistan’s girls in the five to 16 age group are not in school, according to the United Nations. “We will have stress-free women. We will have happier and healthier women.”Omer says her interest in women’s and minority rights began early. “What inspired me was just seeing the blatant mistreatment every day,” she says. “The economic, physical, and verbal exploitation that women face, whether it’s on the streets, in the media, or inside homes, never sat right with me.”She credits her mother for making her grow up to be an empathetic and understanding person.After completing school, she worked as a gender and criminal justice consultant at Crossroads Consultants, a Pakistan-based firm that collaborates with NGOs and development partners on gender and criminal justice reform. At the age of 19, she also volunteered at Aurat March, an annual women’s rights movement and protest held across Pakistan on International Women’s Day – it’s a commitment she has kept up since then.Her first step into activism came at 16, when she and her friends started putting together “dignity kits”, small care packages for women in low-income neighbourhoods of Islamabad. “We would raise funds with bake sales or use our own money,” she recalls.The money she was able to raise enabled her to distribute about 300 dignity kits that she and her friends made themselves. They each contained pads, underwear, pain medication and wipes. But she wanted to do more.She got a chance when she started working at the Supreme Court in early 2025, first as a law clerk. She’s currently pursuing postgraduate studies in gender, peace and security at the London School of Economics and says that she will go back to Pakistan to resume her practice after she graduates.She became friends with fellow lawyer Ahsan Jehangir Khan, who specialises in taxation and constitutional law. The plan to challenge the “period tax” emerged from their conversations.“He pushed me to file this petition and try to get justice instead of just sitting around.”Khan, who is Omer’s lawyer in the case, says that fighting the taxes is about more than accessibility and affordability of sanitary pads – it’s about justice. “It’s a tax on a biological function,” he says.Tax policies in Pakistan, he says, are written by “a privileged elite, mostly men who have never had to think about what this tax means for ordinary women”. The constitution, he adds, “is very clear that you cannot have anything discriminatory against any gender whatsoever”.To Amjad, the Dastak Foundation founder, the fight for menstrual hygiene is closely tied to her other passion – the struggle against climate change. The extreme weather-related crisis, such as floods, that Pakistan has faced in recent times, she says, hit women particularly hard.She remembers the trauma many women she worked with after the 2022 floods described to her. “Imagine that you are living in a tent and you have mahwari [menstruation] for the first time,” she says. “You are not mentally prepared for it. You are running for your life. You don’t have access to safety or security. That trauma is a trauma for life.”As temperatures rise on average, women will need to change sanitary pads more frequently during their periods – and a lack of adequate access will prove an even bigger problem, Amjad warns. She supports the withdrawal of taxes on sanitary pads – but only those made from cotton, not plastic ones that “take thousands of years to decompose”.Amjad is also campaigning for paid menstruation leave. “I have come across women who were fired because they had pain during periods and couldn’t work,” she says. “When you are menstruating, one part of your brain is on menstruation. You can’t really focus properly.”Meanwhile, opponents of the taxes are hoping that Omer’s petition will pressure the Pakistani government to follow other nations such as India, Nepal and the United Kingdom that have abolished their period taxes.Taking on that mantle against the government’s policies didn’t come easily to Omer. Her parents, she says, were nervous at first about their daughter going to court against the government. “They said it’s never a good idea to take on the state,” she says.Now, they’re proud of her, she says. “They understand why this matters.”To her, the case is not just a legal fight. “When I think of this case, the picture that comes to mind … It’s not a courtroom, it’s a feeling of justice,” she says. “It makes me feel a sense of pride to be able to do this and take this step without fear.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Brandi Carlile: 'Joni Mitchell is wild. She'll drink you under the table'","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq123nxpy3o","message":"","news":"When Brandi Carlile was 12 years old, living in a mobile home in an isolated community 50 miles outside Seattle, she begged her parents for a piano.She'd fallen in love with her mum's Elton John albums and wanted to play along.But when she broke her tiny Casio keyboard out of its Toys R Us box, she had to face an uncomfortable reality.\"I was just nowhere near talented enough,\" she laughs.Instead, she put on Bruce Springsteen's Streets Of Philadelphia, dialled up the keyboard's \"synth strings\" setting, and pressed down two keys.\"You just hold them, all the way through the verse,\" she recalls. \"Anyone can do it, but that's the foundation of my career.\"Fast forward 32 years and Elton John is one of her best friends. In January, they released a collaborative album, Who Believes In Angels, that topped the UK charts (Carlile contributed significantly more than two notes).The musician has also been responsible for Joni Mitchell's musical rehabilitation, coaxing the 81-year-old back onto the stage after a near-fatal brain haemorrhage.And she's spent the last six years duetting with some of pop's biggest stars, from Miley Cyrus to Noah Kahan, while curating her annual Girls Just Wanna festival in Mexico.All those opportunities stemmed from a single performance at the 2019 Grammys, where Carlile delivered a spine-tingling version of The Joke, an anthemic ballad for the persecuted.\"I'd played that song hundreds of times but I never could really hit that last note,\" she confesses now.\"But at the Grammys, I really wanted to get it right. So for days leading up to the show, I trained and I trained and I trained. And when I hit it, I could hardly finish the song. I wanted to jump up and down.\"She wasn't the only one. Jaws were dropped. Eyes were popped. A star was born.Before she'd even left the stage, Carlile's phone was blowing up with texts from people \"so famous I couldn't fathom it\".\"I suddenly had this river of opportunity flowing into my life, and I didn't know how long it was going to last, and so I said yes to everything,\" she recalls.Looking back, she reckons the eagerness to grasp those opportunities was a reaction to her childhood.Growing up in rural America, Carlile knew she was gay, but had \"never met\" another gay person in her life.Her sexuality changed her relationship with her mother.\"All the ways she thought she was going to relate to me, she couldn't,\" says Carlile.\"I didn't want to do make-up or learn to shave my legs or have long hair, and she was just like, 'What do I do with this child?'\"They eventually bonded over music - even forming a sort of informal tribute act to mother-daughter band The Judds.But the sense of otherness remained, even after Carlile married and had two kids with British charity director Catherine Shepherd. So when opportunity came knocking, she felt obliged to chase it.\"I think it could be the gay thing, this kind of coyote thing, where it's like, 'Keep your eye on the prize. You're being included right now, you might not be included tomorrow. Accept everything, do everything, achieve, assimilate,'\" she says.Then, as suddenly as it arrived, the instinct vanished.Last October, she flew straight from a show with Joni Mitchell to a recording session with Aaron Dessner - co-founder of rock group The National, and a key collaborator for Taylor Swift.By the time she landed in New York, she was hungover and overwhelmed with emotion. Instinctively, she knew the comeback concerts she'd masterminded with Joni had run their course.\"I couldn't bear the thought of not sitting next to her and listening to her sing Both Sides Now again,\" she says. \"I'd had the best damn seat in the house.\"Dessner showed Carlile a few pieces he'd been working on, then left her to work in his barn. Exhausted, she went upstairs, climbed into bed, and wrote a poem that captured her mood.\"Returning to myself is such a lonely thing to do / But it's the only thing to do.\"After six years of chasing opportunities, it was time to turn inwards.\"I knew I was at the end of something,\" she says, \"and that, yes, the phone might stop ringing, but I don't want to miss out on my kids' childhood.\"The poem became the title track and north star for her new album, which wrestles with the passage of time, and the delicacy of human connection.When Dessner started playing atmospheric synth chords in the studio, it unlocked the memory of those first musical experiments on her Casio keyboard.\"I felt 13 or 14 again, and it made me write things differently,\" she says. \"I had this huge lump in my throat the whole time. I was embarrassed to sing the songs in front of everybody because I thought I would cry - and I did.\"Listeners might need a box of tissues, too.When Carlile played You Without Me at Glastonbury this summer, there were more than a few misty eyes, as people digested the story of a parent coming to terms with their child's independence.\"I've started to see those moments, and it's soul crushing,\" says the singer, whose  eldest daughter, Evangeline, is 11. \"But at the same time you're overwhelmed with pride.\"Her daughters inspired one of the record's angrier songs, too. Church And State rails against the increasing influence of conservative religious ideology on US politics.Recorded live on election night 2024, it addresses Carlile's fear that the Supreme Court could overturn Obergefell v Hodges, which recognised same-sex marriage in 2015.It was prompted by a dinner conversation, where Evangeline suggested the family could just get on Carlile's boat and \"bebop up to Canada\" if gay marriage was outlawed.\"I don't want to go to Canada,\" protested their youngest, Elijah.\"And Evangeline just snapped and said, 'Elijah, it's better than not having a mommy or a mama'.\"I felt so ashamed for not explaining it better. They assumed that if it ever happened, they'd be orphans.\"And then I felt so angry that something so archaic and antiquated could even be a possibility in the country I live in, let alone legitimately on the horizon.\"The album's other guiding light is Mitchell, whose strict quality control is \"the reason I write a lot fewer songs,\" Carlile says.She pays an affectionate but cheeky tribute to the singer on a song simply called Joni.\"She doesn't suffer fools, she won't make cups of tea, and she won't bandage bruised egos,\" sings Carlile over a delicately plucked guitar.\"She is a wild woman,\" laughs the star. \"She's 83 and she will drink you under the table.\"She loves Cadillac margaritas and plain Black Jack. And she is unpredictable, untameable, unknowable sometimes, and it's amazing.\"Presumably it was nerve-wracking to play Mitchell the song?\"Oh, I was quaking,\" she laughs. \"She was sitting at her desk in her bedroom, putting butterfly clips in her hair, as Joni Mitchell does, and just listening to the song with this furrowed brow, not reacting whatsoever.\"But this big smile spread across her face after the last chorus. Then she made me wait a good minute before she nodded at me like, 'This is great.'\"One lyric, however, created a little friction.\"When I tell you I love you, and you tell me 'OK'... That's love in your way.\"\"When she heard that she called me an asshole!\" Carlile laughs, \"because she knew exactly what I meant - and you're not supposed to get Joni Mitchell. She doesn't want to be understood.\"As you might expect, Carlile is full of similarly starry anecdotes.She recalls seeing Paul McCartney at the side of the stage during her Glastonbury set (\"that was a top five moment\"); and spills the beans on Dolly Parton's tattoos (\"I haven't seen them, but I know people who have. She can be really rugged and curse.\")So what would that lonely child, who warmed her hands around a wooden stove and struggled to play Elton John songs, think about her elevation to the highest echelons of music?\"I have a lot of affection for that girl now, in ways that I didn't at the time,\" she reflects.\"She would love to know that it happened and that she made it. Because I've made it beyond where I hoped, and I'm not sure what to do with that.\"If Returning To Myself is the first draft of her answer, it suggests the possibilities are limitless.With a new confidence and a new direction, Carlile is breaking into uncharted territory: Herself.The multi-platinum selling artist will appear on 21 June as part of his summer tour.The singer is playing at Bedford Park in 2026.A hall at the Sustainable Community Hub in Shipley has been fitted out as a 237-capacity venue.Rory Friers spent six months with residents and staff of Glendun Care Home in Cushendun in 2022.The musician, best known for Tainted Love and Say Hello, Wave Goodbye, died in his sleep at home.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Later she walks around the old town, maybe meeting up with friends for an Aperol, or browsing the twice-weekly market.“Honestly, it feels magical,” Neis tells CNN Travel. “I just can’t believe I’m living here.”A Michigan native who grew up in Texas, Neis feels at home among Uzès’ narrow streets and medieval architecture, even though she hadn’t set foot in the town until six months ago.So how did she end up moving her life there? Simple: She let ChatGPT choose.“I know that sounds crazy, to let AI make a decision about your life,” she says today. “But it was relieving me from the overwhelm that I felt, and it could just be an adventure.”Artificial Intelligence, she says, “chose well.”Her connection with France began during her younger years, when she studied the language at school. Neis completed a year of language study in the country and later moved to Paris for five years starting in 2004.“It’s just funny because the decision (I made) at 11 or 12 years old ended up changing the course of my life,” she says.After nearly five years, she returned to the United States and threw herself into her tech career. She eventually built what she calls “a great job and salary, and lots of travel” — but also hit “huge burnout.”‘I have to pinch myself’: This American woman moved to Spain in her 30s, now she’s helping others do the same“I think my nervous system just got fried,” she says. She pushed through anxiety, depression and chronic fatigue, but symptoms including anxiety attacks and back pain began to worsen. She says she “felt like a shell of a human.”Neis knew she needed a change. France — the place she’d always loved — drew her back.Neis left her corporate job and returned to Paris, hoping to find contentment again, but the city left her feeling “overstimulated.” She wanted to stay in France, but couldn’t decide where.So she asked ChatGPT.After typing in her “whole backstory” — her values and a wish list that included a slower pace of life, good weather, markets and an international community — the AI chatbot suggested two towns: Sarlat-la-Canéda in southwest France’s Dordogne region, and Uzès. Still unsure, she told ChatGPT to pick one.“Sarlat was more remote,” she says. “So it had suggested maybe Uzès is better.”Neis also consulted friends and online sources, but appreciated how ChatGPT cut through the noise and gave her “succinct” answers. Once she — or rather ChatGPT —made the call, she started the move.She applied for a Passeport Talent, a residence permit for skilled professionals, investors, and entrepreneurs, which came through after a few months.As she’d been living nomadically for years by this point, Neis, who was based in San Francisco at the time, didn’t have many belongings to pack up. She quit her job, sold her car and flew to Nice.They retired to France, and say they’d be ‘absolutely broke’ if they’d stayed in CaliforniaShe arrived in March with two suitcases and a duffel bag, took the train to Avignon, rented a car, and drove to Uzès.Neis remembers walking into the “adorable” town for the first time and thinking, “Okay, here we go.’”The AI’s choice, she says, turned out to be “very accurate.” She loved that she could walk across the old town in a matter of minutes, and the warmth — of both the people and the weather — drew her in.She rented a furnished one-bedroom apartment with vaulted ceilings and a view of the medieval tower and began trying to build a community.Although she’s moved to France alone before, she worried about feeling isolated this time.“Friendships are important to me,” she says. “Community is important to me. And I just thought, maybe I’m not going to have that.”At first, she jokes, she was probably known as “the American who was always by herself.” But her YouTube channel helped her meet other international residents — mostly retirees.“When I met those expats, they were like, ‘Wow, you really bring our age down by quite a lot,’” she says, adding that she’s since met other residents closer to her age.After spending much of her life in an environment where the “emphasis was on work,” Neis loves the fact that people in France don’t immediately ask what she does for a living.“I mean, maybe eventually they will, but it’s not the first question they ask,” she adds. “Because that’s not the most important thing…”Life is cheaper overall, she says, but salaries are lower and prices have risen.“I understand from locals that the cost of living/buying has really gone up,” she says.Neis says she misses American conveniences — especially grocery stores open on Sundays — and sometimes takes a bus to the larger cities of Nîmes or Avignon to visit an Asian superstore and pick up “goodies” like soy sauce.“It would be a full-day affair, essentially, just to go and do that,” she says. “Because it doesn’t exist here. So being in a small town means you’re really limited.”Still, Neis has fully embraced life in Uzès and says moving there has helped her recover.“I completely feel like myself again,” she says. “I just can’t even express what a relief that is… Because I got to the point where I just thought I was never going to feel normal again.”She’s launched a YouTube channel, French Julie Travels, documenting her life in France and now hosts week-long retreats and food tours.Neis plans to stay in Uzès for the foreseeable future and is even considering buying an apartment, even though property prices have recently risen sharply.She visits the US once or twice a year and is planning to be back for Christmas, but while she remains “open to all possibilities,” she doesn’t see herself moving back permanently.“It feels like this little town is where I’m meant to be — whether for now, a few years, or possibly forever,” she says.Letting ChatGPT decide may sound risky, Neis says, but for her it worked.“It’s scary to leave a full-time salary and not know how things will unfold,” she says. “But I’m so much happier. It’s an adventure, and I feel so lucky to be here experiencing this new life.”Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter.

They only did this to interfere with the decision of the US Supreme Court, and other courts,” Trump wrote.“Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump added.Earlier on Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute said on social media that a TV advertisement created by the government of Ontario in Canada “misrepresents the ‘Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade’ dated April 25, 1987.”The foundation also said that Ontario had not received its permission “to use and edit the remarks” of the late US president.The foundation added that it was “reviewing legal options in this matter” and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan’s address.Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford said earlier this week that the advertisement in question – featuring President Reagan criticising tariffs on foreign goods while saying they caused job losses and trade wars – had caught Trump’s attention.“I heard that the president heard our ad. I’m sure he wasn’t too happy,” Ford said on Tuesday.In an earlier post on social media, Ford posted a link to the advertisement and the message: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together,” he said.It’s official: Ontario’s new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched.Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada.

Three single tables were arranged opposite display cases, place settings laid out, and bowls of steaming noodles served to a handful of guests.My companion on the evening of October 9 was an 18th century suit of samurai armor. Beautifully ornate and ramrod straight, the armor cut an imposing figure, remaining stoic, even as I fumbled the pickles and let out a mortifying slurp halfway through. As company goes, the samurai was mercifully non-judgmental, and the meal surprisingly tranquil; a world apart from the chaos of Oxford Street and Soho’s restaurants, a stone’s throw away. And that was kind of the point.The solo dining experience — free and open to the public to eat — was the brainchild of communications agency Exposure, hired by itsu, a chain of British East-Asian restaurants and groceries, to launch a new range of noodles for one.“In Japan, solo dining is celebrated — there’s even a word for it, ‘ohitorisama,’ meaning the joy and freedom of doing things alone,” explained Lloyd Abbott, Exposure publicity director. “In the UK, however, eating solo still carries a certain stigma; it’s seen as awkward, even a little sad. We saw an opportunity to challenge that.”Itsu got a quirky product launch, and in return the British Museum received payment for use of its space.The commercial event was at the niche end of London institutions’ never-ending mission to attract new visitors and diversify their revenue streams.All over the capital, places are offering the public unusual experiences and unfettered access. Ever wanted to have a silent disco in the Science Museum? Take a gong bath at the Natural History Museum? Glamp with the lions at London Zoo? Now you can.At the Natural History Museum — the UK’s second most-visited attraction  — what started with the sleepover event “Dino Snores for Kids” in 2010 has grown into a comprehensive after-hours program. Evening tours, discos, overnight stays, yoga underneath the skeleton of Hope the blue whale, have blown away the cobwebs from the 144-year-old museum.The beautiful Alfred Waterhouse-designed building, conceived as a “cathedral to nature,” has hosted 250 sleepovers and 80 silent discos to date, and parties for Halloween, New Year’s Eve and Valentine’s Day get “bigger and better every year,” said Hannah Douglass, the museum’s visitor events manager. It’s even adding a dash of glamour with an upcoming evening featuring Emmy-winning actor Bryan Cranston and the museum’s minerologist Alan Hart, for a talk titled “The Chemistry of ‘Breaking Bad.’”“We couldn’t ignore the incredible opportunity to use our unique space and resources to creatively bring the museum’s science work to new audiences in an accessible, fun way,” said Douglass.She added the events “draw in crowds that otherwise may never have thought to visit… People come for a dance with the dinosaurs and end up talking to space scientists while holding a drink in one hand and a meteorite in the other.”London’s after-hours events follow in the footsteps of First Saturdays, the granddaddy of alternative programming, which has been running at New York’s Brooklyn Museum since 1998.On the first Saturday of most months, the museum hosts musical performances, DJ sets, art making, talks and tours, themed around a current exhibition. Often a full-blown party with signature cocktails flowing, the event is “critical to our mission and values,” said Lauren Zelaya, director of public programs.The museum says over 1.2 million visitors have participated in First Saturdays since it began, 82% of whom are New Yorkers — higher than the museum’s total average — and nearly four-fifths of whom identify as Black, Indigenous, or people of color.“In the early days, the focus was on making the museum open and accessible to the public, which remains the ethos today, said Zelaya.Back in London, there’s also an emphasis on community-oriented programming. According to the most recent survey of UK museum directors by national charity Art Fund, published in 2024, international visitors remain below pre-pandemic levels. Going hand in hand, 83% of museums said they were making local audiences a priority.It may be paying off. According to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA), in some cases, including the British Museum and Natural History Museum, overall visitor numbers have not only recovered but surpassed pre-pandemic totals.Douglass says the Natural History Museum’s after-hours visitors are typically less international than in the daytime. She also noted that since the rise of people working from home, fewer visitors are coming straight from the office. “They might need a little more convincing to come into central London in the evening,” she said, referring to after-hours programming.If evening is when Londoners come out to play, it’s also when museums are looking to balance their books.Since 2001, admission to the permanent collections of national museums in the UK has been free to the public. Museums rely on public funding, philanthropy and earned income, through ticketed exhibitions and events, including after-hours programming.Some events are free, but others are pricey. A VIP indoor camping experience in the Hintze Hall in the Natural History Museum can cost adults about £280 ($376), for example.“Museums across the UK are operating in an increasingly challenging environment,” said Lucy Bird, policy and research lead at Art Fund. “Years of real-terms cuts, the cost of maintaining aging buildings, and rising overheads are placing them under immense strain.”In the 2024 survey, two thirds of responders expressed concerns about funding shortfalls, Bird said. “Museums told us they would need a 10-20% increase in funding simply to stabilize,” she added.Bird also pointed to a 2025 government spending review by the Campaign for Arts, which calculated that by 2029, the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport (which distributes public funding to 15 national museums and galleries) will spend more than a third less per person than it did in 2010.It’s no wonder many institutions are expanding after-hours commercial and other private hire events. Fees for the latter can be hefty — the venue hire alone for evening dining at the Victoria & Albert Museum’s Raphael Court starts at £18,000 ($24,000) plus VAT (tax charge). You can even hire the whole Natural History Museum for an evening for £75,000 ($100,000).Lisa Guastella, head of commercial hire at the British Museum, said commercial events have been rising year on year, and 79 took place at the museum in 2024.These events, along with filming, “are a vital part of contributing to the British Museum and its objectives, and ensuring we can continue to provide free entry to the public,” she said.Notable events in previous years include after-parties for the finale of the HBO series “Succession” and Prime Video’s  “The Rings of Power,” and this September, a London Fashion Week dinner honoring label Erdem. There has also been an uptick in product launches, said Guastella, like the one put on by itsu.That, she added, was “one example where we were not only able to generate revenue but also reach new visitors by highlighting the Mitsubishi Japanese Galleries, and mention our upcoming samurai exhibition in February 2026.”A win-win-win for coffers, programming and palates.© 2025 Cable News Network.

On Thursday, the FBI also carried out arrests, including of NBA players allegedly involved in the scam.The news came during the NBA season’s opening week, just as the league launched new broadcast deals worth $76bn over 11 years. It’s the latest in a series of scandals to hit US sport since sports betting took off in 2018.Here is what we know.A sweeping federal investigation has shaken the world of professional basketball, uncovering ties between NBA figures and organised crime in an illegal betting network worth millions of dollars.“The investigative work that culminated with this morning’s operation are reminiscent of a Hollywood movie. But this was not luck, and it was not theatrics,” said Ricky Patel, the special agent in charge of homeland security investigations, who has led the ongoing probe.In total, 34 individuals were arrested across 11 states. Among those arrested were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, and former Cleveland Cavaliers player Damon Jones.Authorities said they unsealed the indictments and carried out coordinated arrests nationwide on Thursday.pic.twitter.com/UcOBnWxe00— FBI (@FBI) October 23, 2025First indictment: Sports betting scheme (US v Eric Earnest Indictment)In the first case, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and several others are accused of using insider information, knowing when players would sit out or leave early with “injuries”, to place targeted bets on those athletes underperforming in points, assists or rebounds.“They also misused information obtained through longstanding friendships that they had with NBA players and coaches,” Joseph Nocella, the interim US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said.The indictment highlights seven games in 2023 and 2024 on which hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of illegal bets were allegedly placed.Rozier’s lawyer denies all charges and said that his client will fight the legal accusations.Second indictment: Poker cheating operation (United States v Aiello)The second case centres on a sophisticated poker-cheating ring allegedly orchestrated by organised crime groups in New York.According to prosecutors, victims were drawn into high-stakes poker games after being told they would compete against well-known former athletes, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups.But the games were rigged. Crime groups allegedly used fake shuffling machines and an X-ray poker table that showed players’ hidden cards, letting them cheat victims out of huge sums.Officials say victims lost at least $7m overall. Those charged include game organisers, suppliers of the cheating equipment, and participants, among them Billups, who allegedly took part in several such games in 2019.Prosecutors say the scheme was backed by members of the Bonanno, Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese crime families, which controlled portions of New York’s underground poker circuit. These groups allegedly collected a share of the profits, enforced payments through extortion and robbery, and laundered proceeds via cryptocurrency and other channels.Along with the Colombo family, the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese groups represent the “Five Families”, which have dominated New York’s Italian-American mafia since 1931. They form part of a broader American-Sicilian network known as La Cosa Nostra (Our Thing), whose members maintain ties to their counterparts in Sicily.Thirteen members and associates of the crime families were also indicted.These are the defendants named in the indictments that include former and current NBA players:Chauncey Billups: Portland Trail Blazers head coach. Billups is alleged to have functioned as a “face card” (a celebrity figure used to attract players) for poker games that were rigged. Billups was also a star player in his time, a part of the NBA for 17 years, most of those years with the Detroit Pistons.Damon Jones: Former NBA player and assistant coach for Los Angeles in 2022-23. Jones is accused of supplying inside information to allow a network of conspirators to place winning bets on games. And like Billups, he is also accused of helping to lure wealthy people to participate in poker games.Terry Rozier: An NBA player who, as a member of the Charlotte Hornets, is accused of providing insider information about his playing status to people involved in illegal sports betting. Federal investigators allege that before a 2023 Charlotte Hornets game, Rozier told associates he’d leave early due to an injury, leading to heavy bets on his “unders”.Between December 2022 and March 2024, the defendants allegedly ran a plan to profit from insider NBA information by placing bets that were almost guaranteed to win, then hiding the money trail afterwards.Some of the methodologies include:According to the indictment, the defendants and their partners used high-tech cheating devices and secret communication systems to control the outcome of underground poker games.Some of the methods include:The hidden readerOther tools used:The defendants also occasionally used other technologies, including:According to experts, this is unexpected.“The idea that poker would be at least part of today’s news was unexpected,” Mike McCann, professor of law at Harvard University, told Al Jazeera.“And also the alleged role of the mafia, that there are mafia ties to this, that kind of came out of nowhere,” he added.In a statement issued on Thursday, the NBA said it is currently reviewing the newly announced federal indictments and is cooperating fully with authorities.The league also confirmed that Rozier and Billups have been placed on immediate leave from their respective teams.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"AnalysisAnalysisIn pardoning Binance’s founder, Trump sends a clear message to white-collar criminals","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/cz-pardon-trump-nightcap","message":"","news":"MarketsHot StocksFear & Greed IndexLatest Market NewsHot StocksA version of this story will appear in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.The Trump administration excels at sowing uncertainty. But it is sending an unambiguous message to crypto entrepreneurs who may be operating on the fringes of the law, or outside of it: Don’t worry about a thing.ICYMI: President Donald Trump on Thursday issued yet another reprieve for a crypto mogul who happens to have greatly enriched the Trump family’s net worth.Changpeng Zhao, the founder and fo﻿rmer CEO of crypto exchange Binance, served a four-month prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2023 to charges related to anti-money-laundering violations. Zhao, widely known as “CZ,” was released in September 2024. After months of lobbying the Trump administration, he received a pardon, with the White House saying Thursday it believes his case was “overly prosecuted” by the Biden administration.The pardon is expected to help Binance return to the United States after a yearslong investigation found that the company had allowed criminals to freely transact on its platform, enabling actions including child sex abuse, narcotics trafficking and terrorist financing. (The company and Zhao pleaded guilty in one of the largest corporate settlements with federal authorities in US history.)Trump’s crypto conflicts keep piling up. He’s not even trying to hide themZhao’s case was a major victory for the Biden administration, coming just weeks after a jury found Sam Bankman-Fried guilty of multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy in connection with the collapse of his company, FTX, a onetime rival to Binance. (Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in a federal prison, is also angling for a pardon, according to the New York Times.)At that time, prosecutors and financial regulators had an icy stance toward crypto that the industry has long painted as hostile — a fact that helped galvanize crypto advocates to support Trump, who embraced them (and their very wealthy donors) during his re-election campaign.Trump, once a skeptic of digital assets, is now a full-fledged crypto mogul. Having amassed more than $5 billion in paper gains through his own and his family’s various crypto projects, Trump’s digital asset portfolio now eclipses his real estate holdings.But Trump’s success in crypto is thanks in no small part to connections he and his eldest sons have forged with industry bigwigs, including Zhao, whose own net worth is estimated at more than $85 billion.The Trump family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, is hosted by Binance, and the exchange has been a key driver in the growth of World Liberty’s dollar-pegged token, USD1. Earlier this year, as Zhao was activelyh seeking a pardon, Binance accepted a $2 billion investment from an Emirati-backed investment firm using USD1 — a boon for World Liberty Financial, which effectively received a $2 billion bank deposit.Democrats and even some Republicans on Thursday﻿ called the Zhao pardon inappropriate, given the close connections between Binance, Zhao and the Trump family business.“It’s just the latest example of Trump’s Pay-to-Pardon Scheme,” former Labor Secretary and prominent Trump critic Robert Reich wrote on X.Of course, Zhao isn’t the only crypto mogul to discover that plowing money into Trump’s crypto ventures tends to make nettlesome charges disappear.Justin Sun, the Chinese crypto billionaire who poured tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty Financial soon after it launched, had been facing civil fraud charges in the United States under the Biden administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission dropped the case against Sun in February.Sun, who’d reportedly avoided setting foot on US soil for fear of being arrested, was a VIP guest at Trump’s private crypto dinner in May — an event for which guests competed for invitations by buying the president’s memecoin.Other white-collar defendants Trump has blessed with pardons include Ross Ulbricht, a cause célèbre of the Libertarian crypto world, who had been serving a life sentence for creating the Silk Road marketplace, which the Justice Department once described as “the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet.”Trump also pardoned Trevor Milton, founder of bankrupt electric vehicle startup Nikola, who was sentenced to four years in prison for exaggerating the potential of his technology. Milton and his wife notably donated more than $1.8 million to a Trump re-election campaign fund, according to public records.Trump’s full-throated embrace of crypto has been a welcome shift for investors who’ve been trying to usher digital assets into the financial mainstream. At the same time, many advocates have been uneasy with some of his decisions – including Ulbricht’s pardon – that reinforce crypto’s long association with fraud.“I love President Trump; this is possibly the greatest admin of my lifetime - except for these pardons,” wrote tech entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale on X. “POTUS has been terribly advised on this; it makes it look like massive fraud is happening around him in this area.”While news of CZ’s pardon sent a Binance-linked token higher, the broader crypto market was relatively muted.The White House has consistently bristled at any suggestion of impropriety or unethical behavior around Trump’s apparent pay-to-play strategies.And Trump — no stranger to being the target of a white-collar criminal prosecution — defended his decision to pardon Zhao.“Let me just tell you that he was somebody that, as I was told, I don’t know him, I don’t believe I’ve ever met him … he had a lot of support, and they said that what he did is not even a crime,” Trump told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins during a roundtable in the White House State Dining Room on Thursday. “It wasn’t a crime, that he was persecuted by the Biden administration, and so, I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

test","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/as-trump-makes-rare-visit-to-malaysia-pm-anwars-balancing-act-faces-test","message":"","news":"US president’s visit to Malaysia puts spotlight on Southeast Asian country’s efforts to walk a fine line between great powers.By John PowerShareSaveKuala Lumpur, Malaysia – When US President Donald Trump lands in Malaysia for Southeast Asia’s headline summit this weekend, he will be delivering Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim a diplomatic coup.US presidents rarely visit Malaysia, a multiracial nation of 35 million people sandwiched between Thailand and Singapore, which for decades has maintained a policy of not picking sides in rivalries between great powers.Trump is just the third US leader to travel to the Southeast Asian country, which is hosting a Sunday-to-Tuesday summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), following visits by former US Presidents Barack Obama and Lyndon B Johnson.After skipping ASEAN summits in 2018, 2019 and 2020, Trump, whose disdain for multilateralism is renowned, will be attending the gathering of Southeast Asian nations for just the second time.The US president will be joined by a host of high-profile leaders from non-ASEAN countries, including Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.Opting not to attend are Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who Trump is expected to meet in South Korea at next week’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.Trump’s visit, in many ways, is emblematic of the delicate balancing act that Anwar’s government has sought to maintain as Malaysia navigates the headwinds of the heated rivalry between the US and China.Malaysia is deeply entwined with both the US and Chinese economies.The US, which has a large footprint in Malaysia’s tech and oil and gas industries, was the Southeast Asian country’s top foreign investor and third-biggest trading partner in 2024.China, a major purchaser of Malaysian electronics and palm oil, the same year took the top spot in trade and was third for investment.But Malaysia’s efforts to walk a fine line between Washington and Beijing have become increasingly fraught as the superpowers roll out tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls while butting heads over regional flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea.“Optimally, Malaysia wants to productively engage both China and the US on a variety of issues,” said Thomas Daniel, an analyst at the Institute of Strategic & International Studies in Kuala Lumpur.“It is in our interest,” Daniel told Al Jazeera.Anwar has cast Trump’s visit as a chance to bolster economic ties, champion regional peace and stability, and elevate ASEAN’s standing on the international stage.Anwar has also pledged to use the rare opportunity for face time with Trump to constructively raise points of difference between Washington and Kuala Lumpur, particularly the Palestinian cause.“The through-line is autonomy: avoid entanglement, maximise options, and extract benefits from both poles without becoming anyone’s proxy,” Awang Azman Awang Pawi, a professor at the University of Malaya, told Al Jazeera.During Trump’s visit, US tariffs on Malaysia, currently set at 19 percent, and China’s mooted export controls on rare earths are expected to be high on the agenda.For Malaysia, the priority is preserving “rules-based” trade that allows for countries to deepen economic ties despite their political differences, said Mohd Ramlan Mohd Arshad, a senior lecturer at the MARA University of Technology in Shah Alam, near Kuala Lumpur.A prolonged economic cold war between the US and China is the “worst thing” that could happen to Malaysia, Arshad told Al Jazeera.Trump, who has made no secret of his ambitions for the Nobel Peace Prize, is also expected to witness the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, which engaged in a brief border conflict in July that left at least 38 people dead.For Anwar, who has led a multiracial coalition of parties with diverse and competing interests since 2022, the balancing act also involves political considerations at home.US support for Israel’s war in Gaza has been a bone of contention in Muslim-majority Malaysia, where the plight of Palestinians has inspired frequent public protests.In the run-up to the summit, critics have demanded that Anwar rescind Trump’s invitation over his role in supporting the war, which a United Nations commission of inquiry last month determined to constitute genocide.“A person like Trump, no matter how powerful, should not be welcomed in Malaysia,” former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar’s former mentor-turned-nemesis, said in a video message last month.Defending the invitation, Anwar has stressed his view of diplomacy as “practical work” for advancing his country’s interests “in an imperfect world”.“It demands balance, discipline, and the courage to stay the course even when the ground shifts beneath us,” he told a conference in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.As a small power, Malaysia has always put pragmatism at the centre of its foreign policy, said Sharifah Munirah Alatas, an independent scholar and researcher who previously taught international relations at the National University of Malaysia.“Anwar and Malaysia cannot afford to do otherwise,” Alatas told Al Jazeera.“And given the current highly unpredictable Sino-American tension induced by the Trump 2.0 era, ASEAN will remain actively non-aligned, without taking sides.”Awang Azman, the University of Malaya professor, said that while Trump’s visit will elevate Malaysia and ASEAN’s profile by itself, the true test of the summit’s success will be tangible outcomes on issues such as the Thailand-Cambodia conflict and trade.“It’s not just a photo op if a ceasefire accord and concrete trade language land on paper,” Awang Azman said.“If either track stalls, the visit is still symbolically significant – given the rarity of US presidential trips to Malaysia – but the narrative will revert to optics over outcomes.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Ballet legend Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to move past dance","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231214-misty-copeland-interview-influential-katty-kay","message":"","news":"The ballet legend told the BBC's Katty Kay she hadn't been on a stage in years – and now, after listening to her body, she's evolving her professional aspirations accordingly.Misty Copeland, who made history when she became the first African-American woman to become a principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, has taken her final bow. In June, she shared that she would be stepping away from the stage. Copeland performed for the last time at the 85th anniversary of the American Ballet Theatre on 22 October.\"Last night was a moment I'll carry with me forever. After 25 years with American Ballet Theatre, I took my final bow surrounded by the company and community that have shaped my life and career,\" she shared on Instagram on 23 October. \"I'm deeply honored to continue my connection to ABT as a member of the Board of Trustees – supporting the next generation of dancers and storytellers who will lead this art form forward. And possibly most special of all, this was the first time my son, Jackson, saw me dance on stage.\"The story below was originally published on 4 January 2024.As Misty Copeland sits onstage at New York City's famed Lincoln Center, she says she hasn't danced under the lights in years – and she's not sure when she will again.In a candid conversation with Katty Kay for her interview series Influential, in which icons including Hugh Bonneville and Ina Garten have opened up to the BBC's special correspondent, Copeland reflects on an iconic career. Aged 41, she has already danced professionally for 27 years – now, she's ready to talk about what comes next.Misty Copeland's final bowOn 22 October, American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Misty Copeland returned to the stage one last time after a five-year hiatus.Among the guests in the audience was Oprah Winfrey, who spoke to NPR about Copeland's impact: \"Misty didn't just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"While Copeland has hung up her shoes for the moment, she told the Associated Press after her announcement that she hasn't ruled out a return: \"You know, I've become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying 'thank you' to the company. So, it's a farewell. (But) it won't be the end of me dancing… Never say never.\"Named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2015, the same year she made history as the first black woman promoted to principal dancer at the prestigious American Ballet Theatre, Copeland says she's entering a new era.\"Is it hard to think that one day you won't be dancing the way you have been?\" asks Kay. \"Not at all,\" replies Copeland, equally directly. \"I already feel like I'm kind of in this place where it feels really natural. I haven't been on stage in about three years. I know I'll be back on the stage at some point. And that may look very different from what it's been throughout my professional career.\"From on stage to on the page, Copeland has danced in hundreds of shows around the world; written children's books and an autobiography; launched two athletic clothing lines; founded a charitable organisation; and last year, became a mother to her son, Jackson, with her husband, attorney Olu Evans. (She has her own Barbie doll, too.)\"I have so many things in my life that kind of fulfil what ballet has been, and ballet is still in that: it's [also] the work I'm doing through my foundation, it's these incredible projects I'm creating with my production company, it's having a son. To me, this feels like a really natural evolution, that I'm just going with the flow,\" says Copeland. Calm and resolute, she adds, \"I'm so content and I'm so proud of the career that I've had.One day, she may perform again, but listening to her body and slipping off the pointe shoes, for now, \"just feels right\".Copeland speaks with brutal honesty about the pain she's experienced since her earliest days performing. Ballet dancers are often pinned with an \"expiration date\", based on their ages and bodies. Yet these aren't the only factors pushing women out of the sport; it's also the gruelling nature of dance itself, which certainly hasn't spared Copeland. At 19, she suffered a lumbar stress fracture, taking her out of the spotlight for about a year; since then, she has undergone several surgeries and subsequent painful healing journeys.Kay asks Copeland how her body, and her relationship to it, has evolved after having a child and entering her 40s. The dancer's answer reveals the truth about her experience in the sport: \"It's interesting – it's more about the injuries that I've had and kind of dealing with that. I feel good having had a baby, I'm in the gym, I'm doing Pilates,\" she says, explaining that the cycle of constantly incurring then recovering from injuries is what's been toughest.\"I recently had another operation to relieve some of the pressure and it didn't do anything, so that's really the biggest battle that I'm facing, not so much my age. We're ever evolving as artists, as people, as women. You kind of have to just move and adjust with that, but when you're dealing with pain, that's a whole other story.\"As for living in a body that's different than \"Misty at 20\", as Kay puts it, Copeland is accepting the change. \"You know that you're never going to go back to that person. Your body's never going to be – you have to just continue to let it grow and change.\"Thinking back to the early months of the pandemic, Copeland shares her perspective shifted on how much suffering one body should take. \"[It was] right before I had a back injury, and I think I had just been really overworked. It had been 20 years of working non-stop. I think about vacations where I was still taking ballet class every day; I had my pointe shoes. No matter where I was in the world, my poor husband would find a studio or a gym and we'd drive an hour. That's been my life.\"Reviewing Copeland's life in pictures, Kay pulls an image of her on stage in the premiere of Firebird, the 2012 Alexei Ratmansky-choreographed ballet in which Copeland danced the titular role, at Lincoln Center, where the two now sit. The production is also the name of a children's book she created to tell the story of a young girl finding her confidence.\"There's so many mixed feelings around this image, because you don't typically see that many black people going into Lincoln Center. So, for what it represents, there's so many happy memories,\" says Copeland. Yet bitter recollection also tempers the sweet side: \"I also had six stress fractures in my tibia [from that performance], and pulled out of the season the next day.\"As she details the pain-laced memories on her way to becoming a principal dancer, Copeland's strength and determination shine through. Resilience is another core theme in Copeland's story. Kay asks her to reflect on a difficult childhood, and asks if she sought bodily autonomy via the strictures of ballet. \"I think it was more than the control over my body,\" she says. \"I think it was control over the situation. It was control over my life in some way. It was consistency. It was stability. It was an escape – a beautiful, artistic-expression escape.\"Now, Copeland is finding the escape of expression in other ways — ones that don't put her body on the line quite so much.In 2022, Copeland founded the Misty Copeland Foundation, a non-profit organisation to bring \"greater diversity, equity, and inclusion to dance, especially ballet\". The after-school programme offers affordable dance classes, mentorship services, music lessons and health and wellness-related programs to children in underserved areas of the US. In early 2023, Copeland also released Flower, a short film in which she stars that uses dance to explore \"intergenerational equity\". Flower is the first project from Copeland's Life in Motion Productions, the company she founded with fellow former American Ballet Theater dancer, Leyla Fayyaz.Throughout the years, interviewers and fans alike have frequently asked Copeland about her experiences being one of few professional ballet dancers of colour – and this work is where she prefers to take the conversation. \"There are so many things that I think about in terms of disrupting the field and provoking the conversation to be really intentional about the lack of diversity,\" she says.When pushed to reflect on the body-judgment she faced as a ballet dancer who looked \"different\" from others in her company, Copeland puts the criticism into context. \"I was told I was too muscular, I was too short, my breasts are too big. And to me, that's all code for your skin is too dark, your skin is too brown.\"But she believes it is possible for ballet to be more inclusive. \"It's not about what the package is it's how you make people feel; it's how you deliver the performance, the character, and that can be done in a variety of ways\", she says, adding the works themselves fail to reflect modern society.\"Ballets were created centuries ago and no longer reflect society today; a lot of them are really sexist, really racist, something that we're conscious of more so in America than elsewhere – ballets are still being performed in blackface in Russia.\" In 2019, Copeland criticised the Bolshoi Theatre for its use of blackface in performances. According to CNN, the theatre brushed off the criticism, telling Russian state-run media that it would not change its practices.\"I look at myself and my career is not me,\" Copeland says, when asked why she's influential. \"It's what I represent. It's all of the people that have gotten me to this place that I stand on the shoulders of. I just think of my life and my career as this very holistic thing, it's give and take, and it's not just about me. It's so much bigger than me.\"Kay's conversation with Copeland is the fifth in her revealing, nine-part interview series.

US pressure comes to bear on Israel","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/analysis-americas-51st-state-us-pressure-comes-to-bear-on-israel","message":"","news":"The US and Israel have long been close allies, but is Washington now emphasising its dominance?By Simon Speakman CordallShareSaveA succession of high-ranking US officials have found themselves in Israel in recent days – first special envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner on Monday, then Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday.Their focus has been clear – to stop the US-backed Gaza ceasefire deal from collapsing. And that essentially means ensuring that the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not back out of the agreement, which ended two years of war earlier this month.The presence of the US officials in Israel has been described as “babysitting” – designed to twist the arm of a far-right government itching to find any excuse to relaunch the war, which killed more than 68,000 Palestinians.And so far, the administration of US President Donald Trump appears to have largely succeeded, highlighting what some analysts deem to be Israeli subservience to the US, and an acknowledgment that when Washington orders Israel to do something, the latter will ultimately agree.“Of course, Israel is a client state of the US,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli ambassador and consul general in New York, told Al Jazeera. Pinkas referred to the billions of dollars Israel receives from the US in aid, the dozens of times Washington uses its veto to protect Israel from criticism or sanction at the United Nations, and its military protection of Israel.Now the Trump administration is leveraging that support and doing what is a rare occurrence when it comes to relations between the two countries: forcing Israel to act according to the US’s wishes, and making public Washington’s pressure on Israel.Some of that has come from Trump himself – in an interview published by Time Magazine on Thursday, the US president said that he had stopped Netanyahu from continuing the Gaza war. “You know, I stopped him, because he would have just kept going,” Trump said. “It could have gone on for years.”Trump also made it clear in the same interview that Israel would lose “all support” from the US if it proceeded with the annexation of the occupied West Bank, which its parliament or Knesset preliminarily approved on Wednesday. Vance also voiced his opposition to an Israeli parliamentary vote on annexation, calling it “very stupid”.Netanyahu understood the message, and his office called the vote a “political provocation” – even as members of his own government voted in favour, and even though he himself has previously backed annexation.The US has always been the stronger party in the relationship with Israel. It is the global superpower, while Israel is an ally with a traditionally large constituency of support within the US.But US governments, for whatever reason, have often tried to avoid any direct confrontation with Israel. Former US President Joe Biden adopted a “bear hug” policy towards Israel during the first three months of the war on Gaza, arguing that the Israelis needed to be publicly backed in order to convince them to avoid going too far in their destruction of the Palestinian enclave.That did not work, with Netanyahu repeatedly ignoring attempts to get him to agree to a ceasefire. Instead, it was Trump, who is incredibly popular in Israel for the support he gave the country in his first term, who has taken the relatively more confrontational route with Israel since his return to the presidency. So far, it appears to be working.“Benjamin Netanyahu has been put on notice,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera. “The US team can say all these different things –  as they are doing –  but it’s pretty obvious what their agenda is.“Look at the 60 Minutes interview [US presidential adviser Jared] Kushner and [US special envoy Steve] Witkoff gave where they spoke of betrayal and a loss of control. To my mind, this contradicts all the shows of friendliness we’re seeing in the Israeli press. This is the Trump administration coming over and saying quite clearly: ‘You do as you’re told.'”Mekelberg was referring to an interview aired by CBS News last week, in which Witkoff described both himself and Kushner as feeling “a little bit betrayed” by Israel’s decision to strike at the Hamas negotiating team in Doha, Qatar in September. Continuing, Kushner emphasised how Trump, his father-in-law, had felt the Israelis “were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests”.That may go to the root of explaining how Trump, despite his clear support for Israel and his past disparagement of the Palestinians, has been so vocal in criticising Israeli actions. The framing from his administration is that Trump’s restraint of Israel is in the latter’s benefit, highlighting the primacy of the US in the relationship, while also emphasising the bond between the US and Israel.“The relationship between the US and Israel is a central part of both countries’ policies,” said Mitchell Barak, a former aide to Netanyahu. “It’s built on a shared sense of Judeo-Christian values, but Israel is also a valuable strategic partner to the US; it’s also vital in its regional policy as well as providing advances in innovation.”“And what’s more – as we’re seeing from both US business, as well as the Trump family business, who are heavily invested in the region – stability and peace are profitable for all.”“It’s true that Israel’s lost some of its independence in this, but there’s nothing new in that,” Barak added. “I think that’s what we’re seeing right now in the way the US is managing the ceasefire. It’s a combination of carrot and stick and right now, with Vance and the others over, is a reminder of the stick.”And as for the carrot, Trump can focus on what he believes Netanyahu wants – political success, and an end to the prime minister’s legal troubles.Speaking at the Knesset to mark the ceasefire in early October, Trump called upon Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu in the multiple corruption cases he has faced since 2019.“Trump can do that,” Mekelberg said. “He can say to Netanyahu, look, I’ll come over. I’ll talk to the Knesset, I can even ask for you to be pardoned, but in return, you follow the script.”Suggestions that Israel has lost much of its independence in its dealings with the US have appeared to rankle Netanyahu.‘‘I want to put it very clearly. One week, they say that Israel controls the United States. A week later, they say the United States controls Israel. This is hogwash,” said the prime minister, in response to a question about Israel being beholden to the US.Irrespective of Netanyahu’s protestations about US control of Israel, much of the evidence contradicts him. In addition to the current US diplomatic blitz, intended to ensure that Netanyahu carries through with the ceasefire, there are other instances of the Trump administration determining Israeli policy.The ceasefire itself was announced during Netanyahu’s last visit to Washington, seen as a tactic by some observers intended to have the prime minister commit to its terms publicly before returning to Israel.Similarly, during the same visit, Netanyahu found himself being shepherded into issuing a formal apology to the Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani for the strike on Doha. And critically, during the conclusion of Israel’s 12-day war on Iran in June, it was Trump who ordered Netanyahu to stop a planned Israeli strike after the start of the ceasefire.For observers such as Pinkas, these actions have been a pointed reminder to Netanyahu and others of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship between Israel and the US, not least under the Trump administration.“They’re [also] delineating Israel’s freedom of movement,” Pinkas said. “They’re letting Netanyahu and others know that they’re free to go so far without consultation, but that’s it.“[And] they’re reminding Netanyahu that he’s essentially out of options in the US. The Democrats can’t stand him, public opinion has turned against him, and there are many in the Republican Party, and specifically the MAGA [Make America Great Again] wing, who are asking questions about him. He can no longer play one side against the other. This is it.”Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Prosecutors are hesitant to charge Trump foe Adam Schiff, sources say","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/adam-schiff-investigation-donald-trump-ed-martin","message":"","news":"Prosecutors from the Maryland US Attorney’s Office have been hesitant to proceed with charges against Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, a political opponent of President Donald Trump, over allegations of mortgage fraud but the investigation remains ongoing, multiple sources tell CNN.According to three people with knowledge of the prosecutors’ office, Ed Martin, one of the most polarizing Trump Justice Department officials, has been pushing for the investigation into possible mortgage fraud to lead to an indictment.Recently, prosecutors discussed with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office next steps, including potentially reviewing more records, one person told CNN, and US Attorney for Maryland Kelly Hayes is attempting to keep Martin at bay, sources said.Trump administration latest: Shutdown will extend into next week as Senate leaves DCNBC first reported the hesitancy of the prosecutors.President Donald Trump declined to weigh in on the Schiff matter on Thursday, telling reporters, “I hope it’s true, but I don’t know anything.”“You know, I’m not going to comment on that – I would just say Adam Schiff is one of the lowest forms of scum I’ve ever dealt with in politics,” Trump said at the White House. “He’s a horrible human being, very dishonest person. I have no idea what’s going on. You tell me that he’s going to be indicted. I don’t know.””Schiff has been a target of Trump’s ire since leading the House’s investigations into the president during his first term, first as the top Democrat on the intelligence committee’s probe into Russian election interference and then as the lead investigator of the withholding of Ukraine aid that led to the president’s first impeachment.Last month, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to aggressively target some of his political opponents, writing, “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.”CNN later reported the directive was meant to be a private message to Bondi.Asked about the reports surrounding a Schiff probe Thursday, Bondi, who joined Trump for the roundtable, told reporters, “We’re not going to comment on any grand jury that’s open. We can’t legally.”Since that message was sent, Trump’s handpicked interim US Attorney in Eastern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, has secured grand jury indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Its moral debts to Africa demand justice, not just an apology.By Tafi MhakaAl Jazeera columnist.ShareSaveWhen seven Zimbabweans announced on October 4 that they were suing the Church of England for enabling the brutal abuse they suffered at the hands of John Smyth, a leading figure in its evangelical movement, their action was not only about justice for the past. It was an indictment of an institution that has never reckoned with the violence it spread under the banner of faith.Smyth was not an isolated predator. He was part of the Church’s powerful inner circle. A respected British barrister as well as an evangelical leader, he oversaw Christian camps in the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe and South Africa, where more than 100 boys and young men were abused. He embodied the authority and social privilege that shielded him from scrutiny. When reports of his abuse first surfaced in England in the early 1980s, the Church chose silence over accountability, allowing him to carry his cruelty to Africa. In Zimbabwe, his victims were boys from Christian camps, among them 16-year-old Guide Nyachuru, who was found dead in a camp swimming pool in 1992. More than three decades later, Nyachuru’s family has joined six other survivors in a lawsuit against the Church, demanding accountability for both the abuse and the Church’s deliberate inaction.That history has now returned to haunt the Church. What began as the concealment of one man’s crimes has become a symbol of a much older truth: the Church of England’s authority in Africa was never only spiritual. It was built on conquest, complicity and the sanctification of empire.On November 7, 2024, the Makin Review, an independent inquiry established to investigate the abuse perpetrated by Smyth, delivered its long-awaited findings. The report was damning. It revealed how senior Church figures had systematically concealed his crimes for decades, treating him as “a problem solved and exported to Africa”.Four days later, Archbishop Justin Welby resigned, accepting both personal and institutional responsibility for what survivors described as a decades-long conspiracy of silence. His departure marked a symbolic moment of accountability but offered little comfort to those who endured Smyth’s brutality. With Sarah Mullally now archbishop-designate, survivors have urged the Church to use this transition as an opportunity for real accountability rather than another gesture of regret.The Church’s failures in the Smyth case were not only moral lapses. They were the modern echo of its imperial habits: exporting problems to the colonies and protecting privilege at home. The logic of domination that once justified conquest also enabled silence.My family grew up under the long shadow of the Anglican Church.In the 1950s, my father attended St Augustine’s High School in Penhalonga, Manicaland, one of Zimbabwe’s oldest and most respected Anglican schools. His elder brother also studied there and later became a renowned Anglican priest, teacher and head teacher at St Mathias Tsonzo in the 1970s.I was baptised in the Anglican Church in Kambuzuma and christened at St Paul’s in Marlborough. For that reason, I feel both bound to the Church and deeply ashamed of that bond.Like many others, I never fully confronted its past or present brutalities. At independence from Britain in April 1980, Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, a devout Catholic, promoted a policy of reconciliation that urged forgiveness without truth and progress without justice. After decades of colonial rule, we were told to move on, never to look back and ask who we had been before the Berlin Conference of 1884.For 45 years since, there has been no serious effort to hold the Church accountable for its expansive role in Zimbabwe’s colonisation.In 1890, when Bishop George Knight-Bruce blessed the Pioneer Column, a paramilitary expedition funded by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) to seize Mashonaland and Matabeleland for the empire, the Anglican Church positioned itself as the spiritual arm of conquest.Knight-Bruce and his successors saw empire and evangelism as inseparable tools of divine order. They acquired extensive tracts of land seized by the BSAC while preaching salvation through submission to the colonial state.By the turn of the 20th century, the Anglican Church had established mission stations at St Augustine’s, St Faith’s and St David’s (Bonda) in Manicaland. These were not schools at their inception but evangelical outposts, centres for conversion, settlement and the consolidation of colonial authority that later evolved into major educational and medical institutions.They also trained and disciplined African labour for the colonial economy, teaching obedience and industry as Christian virtues in the service of the empire. The pulpit became a weapon of assimilation, and the classroom a tool of subtle erasure and indoctrination. In sermon and scripture alike, subjugation was camouflaged as enlightenment.The colonisation of Zimbabwe was, at its core, a commercial enterprise, and the Church of England profited morally, spiritually and materially from the bloodletting of local communities. Children were taught to despise their culture and submit to an English higher power. The missionary’s cross stood beside the soldier’s rifle, each ensuring the other’s success. Conversion became another form of conquest.This was the faith that shaped generations of African Christians like myself, conditioning us to rationalise Western dominance as divine design.This was not a Zimbabwean anomaly.Anglican missionaries were deeply entangled in imperial aggression throughout Africa. In Kenya, for instance, the Church became part of the colonial system of violence and mass incarceration during the 1950s. The brutality it enabled abroad was mirrored in England itself: polished in appearance but ruthless in practice.That same creed allowed Smyth to abuse Zimbabwean children under the banner of religion, while the Anglican Church posed as a pillar of moral authority.I attended St Paul’s youth programme on Friday afternoons in the 1980s and was fortunate to emerge unharmed. Others were not as fortunate. They endured Smyth’s violence because the Church’s leaders in Britain regarded African lives as disposable.This official dehumanisation was the direct result of the Church’s refusal to confront its historical wrongs or reform its moral culture. Centuries of Anglican hypocrisy, entitlement, denial and racism, perfected on slave plantations and in the colonies, forged the monster Smyth became in Zimbabwe.Today, despite my background, I no longer call myself an Anglican or, for that matter, a Christian. I have not set foot in an Anglican church for 16 years, and I have no plans to do so.Indeed, I no longer pray to the God of the English. My faith in the Church of England and its teachings was broken beyond repair long ago.Far from being an atheist, I now seek a belief, redemption and identity rooted in the knowledge that we, the Manyika of Manicaland, had our ways of faith long before colonisation. What the Church called civilisation stripped our ancestors of their freedom, their voice and their sacred connection to the divine.To this day, the Church of England has done nothing to repair the harm it inflicted on Zimbabwe. Despite occasional expressions of regret, it has remained cautious, even defensive, about the crimes it sanctioned in Africa, insisting that it will offer “no apology for spreading the gospel around the world”.Now, with Sarah Mullally chosen as archbishop-designate, little suggests that the Church intends to confront this legacy with the courage and candour it demands. Its public expressions of contrition remain hollow and performative.Yet the Church’s wealth, a fortune built on centuries of tithes, land seizures, slavery and imperial investments, now exceeds 11.1 billion pounds ($14.8bn). For all its riches, reverent words and supposed moral leadership, a Church shaped by empire still acts as though African pain deserves sympathy but not reparative justice.Until it pays compensation for stolen land, funds reparations and redeems what it destroyed, the Church will remain what it has always been: the principal accomplice and amoral heir of empire.The case of Smyth and the “Zimbabwean seven” exposes the spiritual bankruptcy of an institution sustained by the delusions of white divinity.The Church of England owes Zimbabwe more than an apology. It owes us a reckoning with its soul, if it still has one.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Irish presidential election: Who is running and what’s at stake?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/23/irish-presidential-election-who-is-running-and-whats-at-stake","message":"","news":"A hotly contested race is anticipated following the withdrawal of one of the three candidates vying to succeed popular President Michael D Higgins.By Mariamne EverettShareSaveVoters in Ireland will head to the polls on Friday to elect a new president for a seven-year term.While the Irish presidency is a mostly ceremonial role, this election takes place amid a historic shift towards a more polarised political system, Barry Colfer, director of research at Dublin’s Institute of International and European Affairs, told Al Jazeera.Since the establishment of the Irish Free State in December 1922 and the subsequent end of the Irish Civil War in May 1923, Irish politics, unlike in other European countries, have not been drawn along left-right lines, he said. “What we’re seeing today for the first time in Irish history is a presidential election between objectively left-wing and right-wing candidates.”This change has become more apparent in recent years. In the 2020 general election, left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein – the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army – won the most first-preference votes for the first time since the country’s founding, bringing an end to the traditional two-party dominance of the centre-right parties Fianna Fail (FF) and Fine Gael (FG). By the end of the voting process, Sinn Fein had 37 seats, finishing close to neck-and-neck with FF at 38 and FG at 35.There are 174 seats in Dail Eireann (Irish for Ireland’s lower house of parliament) in total, with 88 needed to form a government.The two previously dominant parties’ origins date back to the Irish Civil War and its aftermath, with FG’s forerunner supporting the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which granted the country partial independence, and FF opposing it.For the first time in their history, FF and FG were forced to enter into a formal coalition government with the Green Party in 2020 to be able to form a government. Following the 2024 election, they partnered with independents instead of the Greens.The presidency has a relatively limited political role, comparable to that of monarchs in other countries, said Gail McElroy, a professor of political science at Trinity College Dublin. It is “seen as a unifying role beyond politics”.The president represents Ireland abroad and hosts visiting heads of state and other dignitaries at the official presidential residence, Aras an Uachtarain, in Dublin’s Phoenix Park.The president is, above all, responsible for ensuring that the Irish Constitution is followed.After the presidency was established in 1938, one year after the current Bunreacht na hEireann (Irish constitution) was adopted, it was generally held by a statesman with a long affiliation to one of the two main political parties. For instance, Eamon de Valera, one of the leading political figures during Ireland’s War for Independence and founder of FF, served as taoiseach (prime minister) from 1937 to 1948, 1951 to 1954 and from 1957 to 1959, and then as the country’s third president from 1959 to 1973.The election of Mary Robinson, Ireland’s first female president, in 1990 “marked a watershed moment”, McElroy told Al Jazeera.The election of Robinson, who had been nominated by the Labour Party and the Workers’ Party, and also received official support from the Green Party, transformed the presidency from a largely symbolic, conservative office into one with more significant diplomatic influence. Her presidential campaign had included a commitment to expand the role of the president into a more active one focused on social issues and to foster an image of a “new Ireland”.Before becoming president, she had served as a senator in Seanad Eireann (Irish senate) from 1969 to 1989, and been a member of the Dublin City Council from 1979 to 1983.During her time in office, she signed two significant bills that she had fought for throughout her political career: a 1992 bill to fully liberalise the law on the availability of contraceptives, and a 1993 bill fully decriminalising homosexuality. She also signed the legalisation of divorce into law in 1996.As president, Robinson also took significant steps to foster an atmosphere of reconciliation between Ireland and the United Kingdom. She made history by being the first Irish president to meet a British monarch, then Queen Elizabeth II, in an official capacity. She also controversially met and shook hands with Gerry Adams, then the leader of Sinn Fein, a significant move towards dialogue at a critical time in the Northern Ireland peace process.And finally, Robinson used her presidential platform to advocate for human rights worldwide, notably becoming the first head of state to visit Somalia in 1992 following the civil war and famine, drawing international attention to the country’s humanitarian crisis.Mary McAleese, the first person born in Northern Ireland to serve as president, held the office from 1997 to 2011 – like Robinson, during pivotal years for the Northern Ireland peace process that culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ending the three-decade sectarian conflict that had begun in the late 1960s in Northern Ireland, known as The Troubles. Her emphasis on reconciliation culminated in a historic state visit to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth II.Michael D Higgins, president since 2011, has stretched the conventions of his office with, at times, strong criticism of government policy on both domestic and foreign policy issues, particularly regarding the country’s housing crisis and longstanding policy of military neutrality.Higgins has also been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, in line with the overwhelming majority of the Irish public, and has been unequivocal in calling for a permanent ceasefire since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza.The Irish government has been one of the most critical voices of Israel within the European Union, supporting South Africa’s genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.Higgins has described Israel’s war on Gaza as the “incredible destruction of an entire people” and echoed the Irish government in calling it a breach of international law.At times, Higgins has made statements and proposed actions that go beyond the realm of formal government policy. He said accusations of anti-Semitism against those who criticise the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amount to “slander against Ireland”, and has even suggested that Israel and the countries that supply it with weapons should be excluded from the United Nations.Any Irish citizen aged 35 or above can seek nomination for the presidency by following one of three routes.One way to be nominated is through being endorsed by 20 members of the Oireachtas (parliament). There are 174 members of the Dail and another 60 senators in the Seanad. Alternatively, a presidential hopeful can be nominated by four out of Ireland’s 31 local authorities.A sitting president may also nominate themselves to run for a second and final term, without the support of members of the Oireachtas or local authorities. In recent history, both McAleese and Higgins nominated themselves for second terms.Only Irish citizens who are at least 18 years old can vote for the president. About 3.5 million people in the country are eligible. Official voter turnout is generally low for presidential elections in Ireland, with the last one in 2018 at just 43.9 percent.Officially, there are three presidential candidates: Catherine Connolly, Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin, who withdrew from the presidential race earlier this month – but after a deadline for doing so had passed, meaning that votes for him can still be counted.Whichever candidate is elected will have large shoes to fill, as Higgins, whose second term ends in November, is regarded as one of Ireland’s most popular politicians.While pollsters currently have Connolly as the favourite for the race, more than 35 percent of respondents have indicated in polls that they will either spoil their vote or not vote at all.Connolly, 68, an independent, is backed by a coalition of left-wing parties, including Sinn Fein, the Green Party and the Social Democrats, among others, and several independent Oireachtas members.Connolly began her political career in 1999, when she was elected to the Galway City Council as a Labour candidate and then served as mayor of Galway, in the western part of the country, from 2004 to 2005. She left the Labour Party in 2007 due to a dispute over candidate selection for the general election, leading her to run as an independent candidate.She has been serving as the TD (Teachta Dala; member of the Dail) for Galway West since 2016. Connolly has also worked as a barrister and clinical psychologist.Connolly would be expected to continue Higgins’s legacy of criticising the government, “and maybe go even further than Higgins”, given that she has always been in opposition, both when she was a member of the Labour Party and as an independent, said Colfer.Connolly has said she is running to use the presidency as an active moral and ethical voice for the nation, with a strong focus on addressing the housing and homelessness crisis and supporting the most vulnerable, including people with disabilities. Her platform also includes promoting the Irish language and supporting a vision for a united – and more equal – Ireland. And lastly, she is campaigning on defending Irish neutrality as an active tradition of peace-making and advocates for human rights on the international stage, including strong support for the Palestinian people.Regarding Israel’s war on Gaza, she has said: “Israel have committed genocide in Gaza. The normalisation of genocide is catastrophic for the Palestinian people, and it is catastrophic for humanity. History didn’t begin on October 7. I will stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people as long as I have breath in my body.”Opinion polls conducted during the presidential campaign indicate that young people overwhelmingly support Connolly, along with those aligned with the left-wing and independent political parties backing her presidential bid.Connolly is the favourite to win the presidency, with the latest poll conducted by Irish broadcaster RTE putting her support at 38 percent.Humphreys, 62, the candidate for FG, is an experienced cabinet member, having held a range of portfolios, including justice and rural development, from 2014 to early 2025.She also served as a TD for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, on the border with Northern Ireland, and as the FG’s deputy leader.Given Humphreys’s political background, she would be much more likely not to challenge government orthodoxy, thus returning the office to a more ceremonial one, said Colfer.Her campaign is centred on celebrating local volunteerism and extending the presidency’s reach across the country. A key aspect of her campaign is also her background as a Presbyterian from Monaghan. She has pledged to use this identity to build bridges between nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland and promote reconciliation across the island, framing herself as a unifying candidate. Humphreys has also strongly advocated for the development and renewal of rural Ireland and support for Irish businesses internationally. Lastly, she has pledged to support the most vulnerable, such as promising increased pension/disability payments.Humphreys is predicted to win 20 percent of the vote.Gavin, 54, was the candidate for FF, which is the largest party in parliament and is led by the prime minister, Micheal Martin. He is a former Gaelic football team manager who also served for 20 years in the Irish defence forces. Gavin is currently working as the chief operations officer for the Irish Aviation Authority.Gavin announced his withdrawal from the race on October 5 following allegations in the Irish Independent newspaper that he owed 3,300 euros ($3,850) to a former tenant. His name still appears on the ballot, however, as he withdrew after the deadline for doing so had passed. “This means he is still a valid candidate,” according to the Irish Examiner newspaper. “Any votes cast for him will be counted as normal, meaning he could still win and become Ireland’s 10th president.”Ever since Gavin withdrew his bid, he has no longer appeared in presidential debates held on Irish media outlets, narrowing the presidential contest to a two-horse race.Gavin is currently predicted to secure just 5 percent of the vote.If Gavin won the election, “he would presumably decline the role and therefore trigger a fresh election”, which would need to take place within 60 days, according to Irish online newspaper The Journal.Ireland uses an electoral system of proportional representation known as the Single Transferable Vote.In this system, a voter ranks candidates in order of preference by marking the numbers 1, 2, 3 (in the case of this presidential election) on their ballot. The voter is free to vote for just one or all three of the candidates.Before the official counting can take place, ballots are sorted in order of first-preference votes. Any spoiled votes are placed to one side, as they will not be counted.If no one secures an absolute majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the next preference marked by each voter.This elimination and transfer process continues until one candidate secures more than 50 percent of the votes.As Gavin’s name remains on the ballot, “it is possible that his transfers could yet be very important in deciding who will be the next president of Ireland”, according to the Irish Times newspaper.The election will take place on October 24, with the result expected the following day. The new president will be inaugurated at a ceremony in Dublin Castle.A number of political issues have emerged during the most recent presidential debates as both the leading candidates have parliamentary track records on issues important to voters, said Colfer.At the 2020 and 2024 general elections, housing was a defining electoral issue for voters. The country’s housing crisis peaked in 2013, as a severe supply shortage combined with a growing population resulted in a rapid escalation in rent and house prices, leading to record levels of homelessness and emigration, as well as widespread unaffordability.Higgins has reflected public anger with the government over this issue, condemning the housing crisis as “our great, great, great failure”, saying that it could no longer be considered a crisis but “a disaster”.It has been difficult for Humphreys to appease voters when responding to questions on this topic, given that she has been serving in government during this time, said Colfer.Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ireland has been reckoning with its policy of military neutrality, which was adopted at the outbreak of World War II, dubbed “The Emergency”, and has since been maintained by successive governments.While this policy, as well as a legislative mechanism known as the triple lock, are not “necessarily related”, some say that reforming the mechanism, as the Irish government has committed to do, “risks undermining the policy [of neutrality] and is a slippery slope towards abandoning it”, said Colfer.While opinion polls have repeatedly indicated that the majority of Irish people want to maintain the country’s policy of military neutrality, the discourse around other aspects traditionally associated with the policy, including defence spending and the triple lock, is “more refined now”, he said.“There is an understanding now that both more defence spending and replacing the triple lock doesn’t necessarily compromise or undermine neutrality.”An Irish Times poll conducted earlier this year found that 63 percent of voters support the country’s current model of neutrality, while 47 percent support maintaining the triple lock.A separate Irish Times poll conducted in June 2023 found that 55 percent of voters supported “significantly increasing Ireland’s military capacity” to defend its airspace and territorial waters.Under the triple lock, no more than 12 military personnel can be deployed to participate in overseas peacekeeping operations without the approval of all three of the Irish government, the Dail and the UN.The Irish government’s main argument for reforming the mechanism is to prevent a permanent member of the UN Security Council, like Russia or China, from having a de facto vote on Ireland’s participation in international peacekeeping missions because of the UN part of the triple lock. No new peacekeeping mandate has been approved by the council since 2014.Higgins has accused the government of “playing with fire” by holding public discussions that he believes are creating a dangerous “drift” away from Ireland’s policy of military neutrality and that risks “burying” Ireland in other people’s agendas.He has also criticised increased military spending as “shocking”, warning that it perpetuates “war as a state of mind” at the expense of investing in essential areas such as education and healthcare.While the Irish government announced in July 2022 the largest increase in defence spending in the country’s history, jumping from 1.1 billion euros ($1.3bn) to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7bn) by 2028, Ireland continues to have one of the lowest defence budgets in Europe.The government argues that reforming the triple lock would not change the policy of military neutrality, which it defines as “non-membership of military alliances or mutual defence arrangements”.Over the course of the presidential campaign, Connolly has positioned herself as a strong defender of Ireland’s longstanding policy of military neutrality and the triple lock mechanism.“I believe in neutrality as an active, living tradition of peacemaking, bridge-building, and compassionate diplomacy. The triple lock is core to our neutrality. It is one of Ireland’s greatest strengths, and I will defend it and the triple lock with determination.”Connolly has also stated that she is opposed to any move that would lead the country to become involved in “dangerous NATO or EU militarisation”.Humphreys, however, has stressed that while she supports a review of the triple lock, she is not proposing abandoning Ireland’s policy of military neutrality.Regarding the triple lock, she has said: “No other country should have a veto over where members of the Irish defence forces serve.”Humphreys has framed herself as a candidate who would maintain strong relationships with European partners and allies and has warned against Connolly’s approach, which she says could be seen as “insulting Ireland’s allies” like Germany, France, the United States and the UK.Since Brexit, Britain’s departure from the EU in January 2020, the topic of Irish reunification has been much more in the public realm than it was even 10 years ago, said Colfer.Both main candidates have stated that they are proud Republicans and express support for Irish reunification.While Connolly may appear to have the obvious advantage with the official support of Sinn Fein, Colfer argues that Humphreys may actually have the upper hand due to her personal connection to Northern Ireland.In addition to her religious background and upbringing, Humphreys has a connection to the Orange Order, a conservative Protestant fraternal society associated with British unionism, through her father and husband, who are both former members. Her grandfather signed the Ulster Covenant in 1912, a petition against Irish self-government.These links to a longstanding Protestant organisation “will help open up a line of communication with Unionists” for Humphreys, seen as important in bridge-building between Northern Ireland’s Catholic and Protestant communities ahead of a reunification referendum, said Colfer.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"The naked pictures that question how we look at the body","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0bvhpwm/the-naked-pictures-that-question-how-we-look-at-the-body","message":"","news":"In his recently published book 'Nakna' (Swedish for 'Naked'), fashion photographer Mikael Schulz takes pictures of the naked body that question the ideas, biases and preconcepts we all have around nudity, conveying a positive message of self-acceptance, beauty and diversity.Video by Ana CatalaProduced by Anna BressaninAdditional Camera & Sound by Madeline JohnsonFollow BBC Reel on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTubeA mysterious 1892 death at a California hotel sparked ghost stories that still intrigue visitors today.Rollercoasters send our hearts racing and stomachs dropping.

New inventions and patents are emerging from countries and cities across the globe, but a few places stand out as driving the greatest progress.The 2025 Global Innovation Index (GII), published annually by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), ranks the top countries and metro-city clusters based on criteria including investment patterns, technological progress, adoption rates and overall socioeconomic impact. Collectively, the 100 leading clusters – from San Francisco to Shenzhen – account for more than 70% of global patents and venture capital activity.We spoke to residents of the top five innovation clusters to discover how technology shapes daily life and how visitors can experience their cutting-edge ideas – often before they reach the rest of the world.China broke into the GII's top 10 for the first time this year, propelled by its surging number of patents, scientific investment and venture capital growth. It now hosts 24 of the 100 leading clusters in the report, with the South China tech centre of Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou coming in at number one.In this region, technology is woven into everyday life and innovation is embedded in the culture. Hong Kong resident Jamie River says you can be at a street market where vendors use QR codes for payments next to handwritten price signs, while small shop owners manage their delivery orders through three different apps. \"The collision of old and new creates this weird energy where nobody's scared to try stuff,\" says River, who has lived here for three years.Hong Kong's Octopus card, which originally launched in 1997 as a payment method for public transport, is now a favourite everyday tech solution that can be used to pay for everything from vending machines to parking meters.To experience Hong Kong's cutting-edge technology, River recommends visitors take the Star Ferry at night and watch the Symphony of Lights show, which synchronises a musical score with lights, lasers and LED screens across 43 buildings. For a glimpse of creative crossover, PMQ (a former police quarters) now houses studios, shops and cafes. \"You'll see 3D-printing workshops next to traditional calligraphy studios,\" he said.Top 10 innovation clusters1. Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou2. Tokyo-Yokohama3. San Jose-San Francisco4. Beijing5. Seoul6. Shanghai-Suzhou7. New York8. London9. Boston-Cambridge10. Los AngelesHome to global corporations from Huawei to Tencent, Shenzen's transformation from fishing village to tech powerhouse was an intentional move by the Chinese government when it designated the city as its first Special Economic Zone in 1980, offering tax breaks and incentives to spur innovation. Its status as a hub for creativity only grew after it was named a Unesco Creative City in 2008, with investment funding makerspaces such as the Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab.\"This supportive framework enables rapid scaling and experimentation,\" said Leon Huang, a resident since 2008. \"Makerspaces such as the OCT Loft and Shekou's Design Society are available to everyone, granting affordable access to advanced tools, including VR setups. The variety of people who frequent these spaces, including hobbyists, students and professionals from tech companies like Huawei and DJI, contributes to a truly inclusive atmosphere.\"Huang suggets visitors catch one of the elaborate drone shows that take place over Shenzhen Talent Park Bay or during major events such as the Spring Festival and National Day. The city recently set the record for the world's largest drone show, employing nearly 12,000 drones.Ranked second, the Tokyo-Yokohama cluster produces the highest percentage of international patent filings in the world, accounting for more than 10% of global filings. What residents appreciate, however, is that the technology and innovation feel practical rather than flashy.\"In Japan, tech isn't some wild imagination of flying cars like what we all imagined 2050 would be,\" said Dana Yao, who met her husband in Tokyo and now splits her time between Japan and the United States. Instead, she says, it's the train card that can be used for buses and vending machines, and the AI sensors at convenience stores that allow self-checkout and cashless pay. \"You'll find these small but mighty innovations everywhere. They're high-tech, but still so human and actually helpful.\"Travellers can experience this tech-forward world at the Henn Na Hotel where check-in is fully automated, some of the staff are robotic and \"smart beds\" adjust the temperature for optimal sleep. Yao also recommends riding the driverless train on the Yurikamome Line in Tokyo Bay. \"It's fully automated and gives you stunning views of the city and Rainbow Bridge,\" she said.For a dose of digital wonder, teamLab Planets offers a tech-immersive art experience. \"Entire rooms react to your movements, light and sound,\" Yao said. \"It's just incredible.\"Known worldwide as Silicon Valley, the San Jose-San Francisco cluster leads the world in venture capital, generating nearly 7% of all global deals. The GII report also found it to have the most concentrated innovation activity per capita.That density is what continues to attract entrepreneurs and start-up founders, especially as the AI opportunity looms large. \"I've never wanted to live in San Francisco until now. It's like the original dot com boom. Very smart people are congregating here and people who left have come back,\" said new San Francisco resident Ritesh Patel, founder of Ticket Fairy.That means networking possibilities are everywhere. \"You could be at a dinner having a conversation about challenges you're facing as a startup founder and the next minute someone at the table says that they can help,\" he said. \"They send a text and suddenly you have an intro or meeting with a relevant person that you could never have reached by email or social media. It's wild!\"For visitors to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, it's all about trying tech before it hits the mainstream. \"You'll discover cutting-edge tech that the rest of the world won't know about for six to 12 months,\" said Patel. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft were widely used here before they became global companies – and now autonomous-driving Waymo cars have significant market share in the area and can be used by anyone who downloads the app.In the GII, China's capital outscored every other city for scientific research output, contributing 4% of all globally published papers. But residents say Beijing’s real strength is its balance between high-tech infrastructure and deep cultural roots.\"Other 'smart cities' really focus on modern edge, but Beijing blends innovation, culture and livability, which makes it feel simultaneously advanced but unique,\" said AI futurist Elle Farrell-Kingsley, who currently calls Beijing her home base. She says daily life is powered by super apps like Alipay and WeChat, which both include translation options, QR code payments and food ordering solutions. She also says AI, particularly Deepseek and DouBao, is built into daily services, which makes translation easier for English speakers.More like this:• Inside Asia's best countries for expats• The secret to life in the world's best cities• Five of the world's safest countries for 2025The only frustrating thing can be leaving home and finding services aren't quite as seamless elsewhere. \"It all functions so well here, it's almost forgettable how integrated and innovative these services can be until leaving,\" she said. \"I rarely see major tech mishaps, and often find myself frustrated or impatient when visiting other countries and not having these services or things not running as smoothly.\"Travellers can experience the city's advanced AI firsthand by booking Baidu's Apollo robotaxi. \"It's incredibly exciting to experience, especially because there’s no steering wheel!\" said Farrell-Kingsley. \"You simply hop in and the car sets off on its own, which feels both futuristic and surprisingly safe.\"Ranked fifth in the GII's innovation clusters, Seoul accouts for 5.4% of global patent applications and leads Asia in VC deals (coming in second overall to San Francisco). Residents say South Korea's drive to innovate comes from necessity, as the small country has a limited amount of natural resources to draw on.\"The country has to compete through innovations and technology,\" said Chris Oberman, who has lived in Seoul since 2024 and writes about his travels at Moving Jack. \"Many people's grandparents lived in poverty, so there is still this huge urge and energy to grow, improve, innovate and not fall behind.\"Much of the innovation and technology is baked into everyday life. Homes typically have doors that unlock with digital codes, and cashless payment systems mean that you only need your phone when heading out. \"Keys, cards, my wallet, cash; I can just leave [them] all at home,\" said Oberman.Visitors can experience the city's futuristic infrastructure along Cheongyecheon Stream, a walkable plaza area with self-driving electric buses that you can hop on and off. Across the city, cashierless convenience stores operate 24/7, allowing customers to take products and pay at smart machines, while AI systems track inventory and prevent theft.--If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.Discover how quirky clips paved the way for viral humour, proving randomness never goes out of style.British mathematician Hannah Fry digs into the science of touchscreens.Why do flying fears persist despite falling accident rates?

Russia had threatened a “painful response” if its assets were seized.Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"headline":"Jamaica could face days of hurricane conditions as Melissa rapidly intensifies in the Caribbean","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/weather/tropical-storm-hurricane-melissa-jamaica-caribbean-track-climate-hnk","message":"","news":"Jamaica is staring down what could become a catastrophic, days-long assault of hurricane conditions as Melissa strengthens over some of the hottest ocean water on the planet.The storm’s outer bands are already brushing Jamaica and western Haiti, where hurricane watches are in effect, meaning hurricane-force winds are possible by the weekend. A tropical storm warning is also in effect for these islands, where officials are urging residents to prepare for power outages, flooding, landslides and dangerous seas.At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a statement.As of early Friday, Melissa just over 150 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, with sustained winds of 45 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is hardly moving.Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify to a Category 4 or stronger hurricane by Sunday, hovering near or over Jamaica with punishing wind and torrential rain through early next week. This explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.Up to 14 inches of rain could fall, with isolated totals topping a foot across southern Haiti, southern Dominican Republic and eastern Jamaica through early next week. Those totals will likely climb even higher, but by exactly how much depends on Melissa’s track and intensity.All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, according to Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness. This designation halts outpatient and elective procedures and ensures more beds are open for emergencies.Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but will likely close within 24 hours of a hurricane warning being issued for the country, according to Daryl Vaz, Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport.The United States mainland is not completely out of the woods, but a direct  hit looks unlikely. If Melissa takes longer to turn north, it could bend toward eastern Cuba or the Bahamas before curving into the Atlantic. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.There’s also still a slim chance that Melissa takes a sharp turn to the north earlier than expected and bear down directly on Haiti. That scenario would deliver highly-concentrated impacts there and torrential rain to the Dominican Republic.As this tricky forecast comes into focus, all signs point to Jamaica being ground zero for what could become one of the most destructive hurricanes of the season.© 2025 Cable News Network.

There’s no agreement on when it emerged from the water, but official settlement began in the 1970s. Today, it’s home to around 3,000 people. But the land they live on isn’t stable; Santa Rosa’s shape and size shifts with the river’s flow. Each year, sandbanks form and disappear, as the main channel carves new paths.“If God wanted, the river would change and even Santa Rosa could disappear,” said Gladys Hari Leiva, a hotel owner who has lived on the island for 21 years.The island’s mercurial geography makes it a difficult place to settle; families adapt season by season, walking across sandbanks in the dry months, then paddling canoes through flooded streets when the rains come.In recent years, as the Amazon has experienced droughts and unpredictable flood cycles, the patterns of change residents have grown accustomed to are shifting with the sands.Yet despite these limitations, the island is coveted by the countries around it. Peru and Colombia have argued over who the island belongs to for decades. As the Amazon River moves, so too does the international boundary between the two countries.Santa Rosa has never been solid ground. The Amazon Basin builds and erases its own geography through its rivers.The main channel of the Amazon River constantly erodes existing land and deposits new earth. Each year the river carries roughly 1.2 billion tons of sediment from the Andes toward the Atlantic, reshaping its banks and islands as it flows. During high-water months, water spills over and settles across the floodplain, leaving behind up to 12 inches of fresh soil annually.Residents who have lived in the Basin for a long time are used to the seasonal ebb and flow of the water and land, but it’s becoming less predictable.In the past two years, historic droughts have left wide dry patches where deep channels once flowed. According to Brazil’s Geological Service, water levels across the Amazon River fell to record lows in 2023 and 2024, and the widespread impact can still be felt by river communities.For Santa Rosa islanders, drought means adaptation: food prices spike, traveling becomes complicated, and some families temporarily relocate to stay near navigable water.“We are used to the rises and falls,” Leiva said. “But now you never know. The floods come at strange times, and the heat is getting stronger and stronger.”It is possible that droughts and floods can speed up erosion in some areas and build land up faster in others, according to Paulo Olivas, an ecologist and environmental scientist at Florida International University.“That’s what makes the future of places like Santa Rosa so uncertain,” Olivas said.Santa Rosa’s fragility has not stopped Peru and Colombia fighting over it. In fact, its shifting shoreline has made matters worse.The roots of the conflict stretch back to the early 20th century when the two countries sought to define their Amazonian borders.Under the 1922 Salomón–Lozano Treaty, Colombia ceded large tracts of Andean territory to Peru, while gaining the city of Leticia — which sits directly across the river from Santa Rosa — and its crucial access to the Amazon River. The treaty and the 1934 Rio de Janeiro Protocol set the border along the deepest navigable channel of the Amazon, a line meant to be natural and permanent. But the river has never been static.Over time, the shifting course of the Amazon created new islands and reconfigured the boundary, leaving new land, like Santa Rosa, that neither side expected to exist.“The island can appear, disappear, get bigger, get smaller,” said German Vargas-Cuervo, adjunct professor at the National University of Colombia and a specialist in the geology and geomorphology of natural systems. “The river moves and so everything that is inside the river is dynamic.”Former Peruvian President Dina Boluarte visited the island in August. Her trip was covered by the Associated Press, which quoted her as saying, “Peru’s sovereignty is not in dispute; the district of Santa Rosa de Loreto is Peruvian and will remain so.”Peru claims Santa Rosa because many of the island’s inhabitants identify as Peruvian and it is administered by Peruvian agencies. In 2025, the Peruvian government declared it a district, with the stated aim of increasing residents’ access to public services and “consolidating sovereignty.”The country also claims Santa Rosa was previously part of Chinería Island, territory granted to Peru under the 1922 Salomón-Lozano Treaty.Colombia disputes this, contending that Santa Rosa did not exist when the treaty was signed and therefore cannot be claimed under its terms. Colombia also argues that the river boundary has shifted, placing Santa Rosa in its territory. President Gustavo Petro recently criticized Peru on X for “appropriating” the island.Despite its small size, Santa Rosa holds strategic and symbolic weight. It sits at the tri-border crossroads of Peru, Colombia, and Brazil — a key transit point for trade and travel along the Amazon. In recent years, it’s also gained modest fame for its food and tourism scene, drawing visitors to riverside restaurants.Leiva is originally from Yauyos, Peru, and moved to the island for job opportunities in the tourism industry. But despite its economic growth, Santa Rosa lags the countries that claim it.There is little infrastructure, and electricity has only become available around the clock in recent years. Sewage facilities remain largely absent, as is running water, with residents relying on wells. Health care is precarious with little government support.Some residents, like Leiva, consider Santa Rosa to be a paradise where international disputes feel more distant than the power of the river. Markets overflow with mixed currencies; multiple languages echo in the streets. Many locals hold dual or triple identities, carrying Peruvian ID cards alongside those from Colombia and Brazil.“Everything is calm here,” said Leiva. “Every day we exchange cultures, currencies, and jobs.”For now, life continues; children go to school, families open shops, and tourists come for nature and food.But beneath that calm, the river keeps moving and reshaping the sand, grain by grain. The same waters that sustain the island can also erase it, a reminder that life on the Amazon is as shifting as the river itself.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

And he can’t seal a deal with a California winemaker to launch a new product line because the government is not approving new labels for bottles during the funding lapse.“The government is still taking money from us, but it’s not paying out what it owes,” he said, referring to the tax credits.The shutdown has frozen many of the government’s key functions, such as lending and processing tax credits. And now without pay, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country have pulled back on spending, creating economic ripple effects.From restaurants in Washington, DC, to businesses around national parks, the shutdown’s impact is spreading through the US economy, with no relief in sight.Sean Han, chef manager at Market to Market, a cafeteria at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, said foot traffic has declined about 20% to 30% since the government shutdown began — during a year that has already been tough because of mass federal layoffs.The business hasn’t reduced employees’ hours yet, he said, but that could happen — in addition to the possibility of layoffs — if the shutdown drags on for longer. With fewer customers, Han said he directed workers to focus on giving whoever comes in a better dining experience.“We’ve been around for about 20 years, so we’ve seen this before,” Han said. “But it took us nine months to recover after the pandemic and we’ll have to rebuild again once this ends.”Restaurant reservations in Washington were down 9% last week compared to the same week a year earlier, according to data from OpenTable.In North Carolina, Pam Anderson is caring for only a handful of dogs at her Ocean Sands K-9 Resort in Kill Devil Hills.Some of her local clients have been calling off or shortening their vacations because the impasse has affected the national parks, or they are federal employees who are not being paid. At the same time, she is not getting any bookings from tourists, which she suspects is because the popular Wright Brothers National Memorial has shuttered.Just this week, a local family who planned to leave their two dogs with her for a few days in mid-November pulled out, which will cost her $500 in lost revenue. The couple works for the federal government.Although the kennel had a “rocking September,” reservations are down 40% for October and 60% for November so far compared to last year, leading Anderson and her husband to tighten their belts. They have stopped going out to dinner a few times a week and are holding off on their charitable giving.“I told my husband the other day, ‘Don’t spend any money’,” said Anderson, 70, who is thinking of getting a night job.Last March, restauranteur Fran Bolden opened a cafeteria at the Redstone Arsenal, a US Army base near Huntsville, Alabama. It was a profitable side venture for Bolden in a town whose economic lifeline is the military, defense and aerospace industries.But that restaurant, Arsenal Eats, is now shuttered until the government reopens. Bolden said they usually expect around 150 people a day for breakfast and lunch; the past two weeks saw only between 25 to 30.“The volume is just not there,” she said.Businesses all over downtown Huntsville and beyond are feeling the pinch, she said, and small businesses bear a big brunt of the burden.“The local economy is in a military city. With people not out, not spending money, not sure what to do – we rely on the business of these people in order to be able to sustain ourselves,” Bolden said.For the past two years, toddlers at Bernard Jackson’s swim and wellness center in Washington, DC, have learned to float for the first time, and seniors in their eighties have practiced gentle exercises to stay strong.But the shutdown has taken a heavy toll. With fewer families able to afford lessons and operating costs on the rise, Jackson has had to make difficult choices just to keep his doors open. Many of his clients are federal employees directly affected by the lapse in pay.“Since people are not getting paid, they aren’t coming to their lessons,” Jackson told CNN as he was leaving an unemployment center.“I can tell you at least 40% of my revenue has gone down.”Even as attendance drops, Jackson is finding ways to support his clients. He continues to send instructions and exercises for them to practice at home.“The pool is still open,” he said.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Smoked mullet with sea fennel butter arrives as a starter, invoking the salty history of France's second city. Hay-smoked cheese with rice flour follows, singing with flavour from the surrounding Provençal countryside. Tourists and locals savour organic ingredients prepared by Michelin-starred chef Sébastien Richard.But Le République is a gourmet restaurant with a few big differences. First, the staff include a recently released prisoner. Second, around 40% of diners will pay just €1 for their three-course feast. And, finally, several diners have never set foot inside a restaurant before.Le République is a restaurant solidaire – one of around 10 in Marseille – run as a social enterprise in aid of community solidarity. Other examples include L'Après M, a former McDonald's taken over by its redundant staff when the franchise closed. The team purchased the premises and reopened it as a social enterprise, serving gourmet burgers created by a three-star Michelin chef served to the beat of Algerian rap, while operating a free food-delivery service of healthy takeout for people in need.Marseille's newest restaurant solidaire is Chaleur, which opened in June 2025. When I visited, it was packed with patrons enjoying chilled cucumber soup adorned with clams, figs and roasted pumpkin seeds. A blowout lunch with wine costs around €25 (£21; $29). But if a patron explains that they're in a penurious position, they can enjoy the exact same menu for a tarif suspend – a \"suspended rate\" – of just €8 (£6.90; $9.29). Across Marseille, prices vary by philosophy. Some, like Le République, partner with charities to subsidise €1 meals, while others, like Chaleur, operate on trust.Chaleur's popularity begs an obvious question: with food this tasty, why not make a profit?\"Benevolence is a selfish way of saying that I want to be fulfilled in what I do,\" says Chaleur co-founder Raphaël Raynard. \"What enriches us is knowing our work is contributing to creating connections and helping people.\" The team regularly serves espressos to homeless neighbours and recently donated 300 meals to a workers' strike.Chaleur's co-founder Nausicaa Roux believes Marseille's status as a \"lighthouse city\" is key to understanding the popularity of restaurants solidaires. Around 2,600 years of migration – including Greeks settlers in classical times to Iberian Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition and Armenians in the 20th Century – has made Marseille one of France's most diverse and religiously tolerant cities.\"As a result, there's a real way of living together that I don't think exists in Paris or London,\" Roux said. \"Folks feel duty bound to help the one in five Marseillais who are born abroad. \"There is an openness not found in other cities in France.\"These emigres didn't arrive empty handed. They carried ingredients like orange blossom water from the Middle East, which is used to make Marseille's iconic navette biscuits. Dates entered Europe via the Vieux Port, the city's ancient harbour, and probably tomatoes and bananas too. The dynamic city dialect includes words in Amazigh, Occitan and Italian, with phrases blending together like a linguistic bouillabaisse, the local fish stew made from imported saffron and regional seafood. Marseille is, quite literally, a global melting pot.Thanks to Marseille's culinary history, food is Marseille's most powerful social tool. Few districts need it more than La Cabucelle, the city's former soap-making area, located high above the Vieux Port. Here, incomes hover around €975 (£849; $1131) per month – some €500 less than the Marseille average – and there's no youth centre or social space. That's why Léna Cardo opened her restaurant-daycare-social space Le Réfectoire, which started serving organic meals in April 2024.Le Réfectoire's large, white-washed interior is a restaurant, library, nursery and information exchange rolled into one. \"Every Monday, we have a history teacher,\" says Cardo. \"She voluntarily gives up her time to teach French history to a dozen mums.\" Every Tuesday, a counsellor offers employment advice for free. \"We can be a place for a parent to learn French or a young adult to find a job.\"However, what keeps customers coming back is Le Réfectoire's sublime food. Daily specials cost around €12, with recent offerings including a sea bream fillet on a bed of Provençal potatoes and tabbouleh topped with a goat's cheese galette. On Wednesdays, local chefs originally hailing from countries like Congo and Morocco take turns in the kitchen and share the revenue. Any excess profit is funnelled into local socio-cultural activities.More like this:• Is the future of French cheese at stake?• Marseille: France's 'good natured' city• The French Riviera's picture-perfect car-free island escapeTravellers are slowly discovering La Cabucelle, with its Moorish facades and Armenian churches. Everyday bar Monday, an epic Marché aux Puces (flea market) bustles with antiques, home clearance treasures and vintage Olympique de Marseille football jerseys. Cardo hopes they will book Le Réfectoire when they come. \"If you're buying something here,\" she says, \"you give money for activities to people who need them.\"The walk from La Cabucelle to Marseille's rejuvenated docklands feels like a veritable world tour. E-scooters flit like barracudas through streets serving Tunisian lablabi soup and Comoran breadfruit crisps. An influencer could hook 1,000 followers with snapshots of Laotian spring rolls and staircases painted in colourful rainbows. In the docks themselves, ferries make nightly runs to Tangier, Tunis and Algiers, while container ships arrive from around the world.Back at Le République, chefs are preparing evening starters like leek vinaigrette with a Parmesan biscuit and grated bottarga. Aside from serving €1 meals to diners in need of nutritious cuisine, the restaurant's central theme is \"insertion professionnelle\" – helping marginalised people back into work.\"[We've employed] people with autism, single mothers who haven't been able to work for 20 years, people who can't read,\" says Sylvain Martin, who co-founded the restaurant with chef Sébastien Richard. \"We have had so many profiles that I can't list them all!\"Some staff have come to Le République from Baumettes Prison, Marseille's toughest jail, where the last person in the Western world to be executed by guillotine took place in 1977. The prison is now home to Marseille's most curious restaurant solidaire, Les Beaux Mets, which translates as \"the beautiful dishes\" and is a play on the maximum security penitentiary's name. The fine-dining restaurant, open for lunch only, was created by the godfather of Marseille cuisine, Gérald Passedat (also the brains behind the L'Après M's gourmet burger) after learning that former offenders tended to return to crime in the absence of meaningful work.\"Taking people from Baumettes is one of the hardest insertions we have,\" admits Martin. \"They say yes to anything until the judge is confident enough to release them.\" He says that some ex-prisoners fail to show up for work but the ones that apply themselves are \"very, very motivated\", having learnt teamwork and timekeeping skills behind bars. The prison confirmed that 75% of inmates who trained at the prison restaurant achieved employment or training upon release, thanks in large part to Le République.The evening service at Le République ends with a turmeric-golden poached pear topped with tongue-numbing Sichuan pepper. There's an unspoken question at the caisse (counter): how can anyone enjoy a €1 dinner?\"We have signed agreements with 100 charities who can book a meal at the price,\" explains Martin. All patrons receive their bill discreetly after dining together, ensuring dignity for those paying a reduced tariff.And what if a diner games the system to bag a discount meal?\"If you are selfish enough to cheat, then do it,\" says Martin. \"It's your problem every morning in front of the mirror.\"--If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.Originating in Topkapi Palace where it delighted Ottoman sultans, this delicacy has a surprising ingredient.'Off-Map Destination' winner Wolfgat offers a menu made from hyper-local and foraged ingredients.The Braai tradition in South Africa is more than just a BBQ, it's a phenomenon that ties the nation together.Mangal 2, a fixture on the London food scene, is redefining Turkish cuisine in a city constantly evolving.AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.Food writer Nick Kwek finds out how the wild landscape of Turkey's Black Sea region influences local cuisine.At Michelin-starred Semma, chef Vijay Kumar brings deeply personal dishes from his childhood to the plate.At Icca, Japanese sushi master chef Kazushige Suzuki blends ancient methods with other cuisines.As part of its mission, Silo uses a nose to tail and root to tip approach to cooking out of respect for nature.The menu at the Icehotel, the world's first hotel made out of ice and snow, is served on plates of ice.How this one simple mistake gave birth to the 50-billion-dollar US chicken industry.London's Darjeeling Express is ground zero for chef Asma Khan, a champion of women's empowerment.Foraging is one of Finland's favourite hobbies and an essential part of the culture.Floating in the middle of a Norwegian fjord, Restaurant Iris takes diners on an 'experiential dining' journey.Deniseea Taylor is a mixologist who teaches what she jokingly calls 'drunk Black History'.Taste of China: How chef Andrew Wong takes diners on a culinary journey across China's provinces.Reel takes you to Italy to explore how the world's rarest and most expensive ingredient ends up on our tables.What we eat, it turns out, can have an impact on how well our memory works.American baker and chef Nancy Silverton explains the difference between British and American scones.A huge recall of frozen fruits is currently happening across the US due to contamination fears.The Nazi high command was put on trial 80 years ago in 1945.

Headlines reported that it was the worst post-Diwali air quality the city had experienced in the past four years.With that, the city once again found itself confronting its annual, predictable - yet avoidable - crisis: air pollution.There isn't a single factor to blame for the toxic air.It's a combination of events - firecrackers, vehicular emissions and the burning of crop residue in the agrarian states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - that leads to the same outcome every year. And as it coincides with the start of winter, colder temperatures and low wind speeds trap pollutants close to the ground.This year too, the same factors are believed to be at play - although there are contradictory reports about what contributed how much to the toxic air this year.Indian media reports, citing a climate research firm, say there has been a 77% decline in stubble-burning incidents this year because of the devastating floods that destroyed much of the region's crops earlier. It blames firecrackers as being the main cause for Delhi's poor air during the festive period.But official data from Punjab tells a different story, PTI news agency reported. According to the regional pollution control board, stubble-burning incidents in the state have gone up three times in the past 10 days, with more than 350 cases reported - up from just 116 recorded until 11 October.In the past few years, authorities have launched targeted campaigns to highlight the harmful impact of stubble burning and to promote the use of machinery as an alternative.These efforts have shown some results on the ground. For instance, farm fires in Punjab fell to 10,909 cases last year as against 36,663 in 2023. But despite the decline, it continues for a simple reason: affordability. It remains the cheapest way to clear fields.And while successive governments have spoken about providing machinery and financial incentives to discourage crop burning, very little has changed on the ground.The other major contributor to Delhi's pollution in this season is firecrackers.Just days before the Diwali festival, India's top court relaxed a five-year ban on selling and bursting of crackers in Delhi and surrounding areas. It permitted the use of less-polluting \"green crackers\" for six hours over two days over the festival. Experts criticised the order saying \"green crackers\" are only 20-to-30% less polluting and still release harmful particles that degrade air quality.Also, the reality on the ground was far from what the court mandated and the restrictions were openly flouted.In many parts of the capital, fireworks started early in the morning and continued well past midnight. And not all of them were \"green crackers\" either. In the run-up to Diwali, BBC reporters saw more polluting crackers also being sold openly in shops.The polluted air that people are being forced to breathe has residents complaining of coughing, watery eyes and breathlessness. And doctors say long-term exposure gradually weakens the body's natural defences, making people more prone to a host of serious ailments.Yet, the human cost of pollution rarely becomes a priority for the region's elected representatives, as political parties resort to the familiar cycle of blame every year.This year too, the Delhi government and the one in Punjab have been engaged in a war of words.Delhi's Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused Punjab officials of \"forcing farmers to burn stubble\" to deliberately worsen the capital's air.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which governs Punjab, dismissed the allegations and, in turn, accused the Delhi government of \"lying about pollution\" and \"playing with people's lives\".Meanwhile, experts and some citizens say the only way forward is through collective, long-term solutions, where both state and federal governments work together rather than relying on temporary, reactionary pollution control measures each winter.For now, as winter creeps in, Delhi and much of northern India choke once again - a tragic annual routine that shows no signs of ending.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.India team will require self-belief and the zeal to clinch its long-standing dream.Virat Kohli falls for a duck in consecutive innings for the first time in his one-day international career as Australia beat India by two wickets.India’s Gen Z is restless and connected, but fragmented and unlikely to unite nationally.The US has put pressure on India to reduce its energy purchases from Russia in a bid to hit the Kremlin's war chest.Asrani, who acted in more than 300 films over five decades, died this week at the age of 84.Copyright 2025 BBC.

The only other recorded mosquito-free zone is Antarctica.The mosquitoes were found in Kjós, a glacial valley to the South West of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik.Mr Hjaltason shared the news of his discovery on a Facebook page for local wildlife alongside pictures of the insects, describing \"a strange fly on a red wine ribbon\", according to Icelandic media.\"I could tell right away that this was something I had never seen before\" he said in the post, which was screenshotted and shared by Iceland's Morgunblaðið news site, adding \"the last fortress seems to have fallen.\"Mr Hjaltason sent the insects to the Icelandic Institute of Natural History to be identified, where entomologist Matthías Alfreðsson confirmed his suspicions.The species are common across parts of Europe and North Africa but it it isn't clear how they reached Iceland, Alfreðsson told CNN.Iceland's cold climate and lack of stagnant water in which the insects can breed are key contributors to the country's former lack of mosquitoes, the World Population Review said.But this year, the country broke multiple records for its high temperatures.Typically, Iceland rarely experiences highs of more than 20C (68F) in May, and when it does those heatwaves will last for no more than two to three days, its Met Office notes. That threshold was exceeded for 10 consecutive days this year in different parts of the country, though.Iceland also saw its hottest ever day in May, with temperatures reaching 26.6C (79.8F) at Eglisstaðir Airport.A June study published by the Global Heat Health Information Network noted that such shifts could have \"significant\" impacts on delicate ecosystems, which have adapted to the cold climate and are sensitive to temperature shifts.Last year was the world's hottest on record, and the UN's climate body has established that human influence has \"unequivocally\" warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land.Further monitoring will be required in spring to see if the mosquito species has \"truly become established in Iceland\", Alfreðsson added.Hjaltason, meanwhile, has speculated on the origin of the specimens he observed.\"One always suspects Grundartangi - it's only about six kilometers from me, and things often arrive with ships and containers, so it's possible something came in that way,\" he told Morgunblaðið.\"But if three of them came straight into my garden, there were probably more.\"Plastic recycling plants in Europe are being shut as they struggle to find a business modelBut bills are still due to rise to fund improvements to water infrastructure.The Environment Agency says the firm is \"significantly below target\".The world's race to decarbonise has led to the rise of electric cars - and with it, soaring demand for lithium, which is required for the batteriesBlue-green algae has been detected in the lough intermittently over the past six decades.Copyright 2025 BBC.

It provides high-speed internet service using a network of thousands of satellites at low-Earth orbit, enabling it to reach remote communities.An investigation by the news agency Agence France-Presse this month found that Starlink receivers had been installed on the roofs of the scam compounds at a “huge scale.”The US Congress Joint Economic Committee has begun an investigation into Starlink’s alleged involvement in the centers, according to the AFP investigation.The move by SpaceX comes as the global scam industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, with criminal groups adopting artificial intelligence and using online cryptocurrency markets to move vast amounts of stolen money undetected.Southeast Asia is a hotspot for these romance or investment scams known as “pig butchering,” named for the practice of fattening up prey before the slaughter. And Myanmar has become an attractive destination for the cybercrime networks, who are shielded by corruption and the military junta.Kristalyn, from the Phillipines, said she was working in KK Park, a notorious scam compound near Myawaddy, a border town in southeast Myanmar, when the internet was cut at around noon on Wednesday.“In the morning the Chinese boss came into our office and told us to return to our rooms,” she told CNN, requesting to use only her first name for safety reasons.“But not long after, he came back in again and told us to just leave the place,” added Kristalyn, who said she had been working there since July.She and around 200 other Filipinos, along with others from India, Pakistan and several African countries, were waiting near the border with Thailand and trying to cross over, she told CNN Friday.“Some of us are staying in abandoned houses, buildings and even some are just staying on the streets trying to cross the border. We have no food here. We have no money at all.”Since taking power in a 2021 coup, the military administration – which does not control all of the country – has fought a civil war against a patchwork of anti-junta and regional ethnic groups.In February, Thailand cut electricity supplies to several areas in Myanmar that are home to the scam sites, to try and disrupt their operations.Soon after, about 7,000 workers and victims were released from scam centers along the border and repatriated in a major operation by Thai authorities.Between January 30 and October 19, Myanmar’s military junta said it had arrested 9,551 foreign nationals from the scam compounds, repatriating most of them.‘Don’t try to escape’ — Inside the shadowy world of crypto ATM scamsBut experts have warned that represents a tiny fraction of people trapped and working in the centers.The military said Monday its raid on KK Park uncovered more than 2,000 workers.Footage filmed for CNN from inside KK Park in April shows paved roads lined with trees and manicured lawns, giving the image of a legitimate business district, complete with a hotel and billboards advertising gambling sites.But a source who works in the anti-human-trafficking field told CNN the raid on KK Park has not stopped operations.While the impact of ceasing Starlink operations “is not nothing,” there were still “many victims trapped inside” other buildings of the compound who “confirmed last night they’re still being forced to scam,” said the source.Transnational crime expert Jason Tower said the military raid on KK Park was “more of a publicity stunt than a crackdown” and that it was “business as usual” for dozens of scam compounds still operating along the Moei River that separates Myanmar and Thailand.Feds seize $15 billion in crypto from ‘pig butchering’ scheme involving forced labor camps“With international attention and outrage over Southeast Asia’s scamdemic rising, the Myanmar military is trying to skirt accountability for transforming the Myanmar-Thailand border lands into a hub for criminality,” said Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).The Association of Southeast Asian Nations meets for a summit later this week in Malaysia, and the scourge of scam centers is likely to be a top issue on the agenda. “The military is also trying to position itself as continuing to take action on this issue,” Tower said.A massive law enforcement operation by the US and UK that recently targeted a Cambodian criminal scam network “likely pushed China to increase pressure once again on the Myanmar military regime to take further action,” Tower added.“It is also likely that the Myanmar military seeks to establish more direct control over some of the scam centers, as it realizes just how much illicit revenue is being brought in by this extremely lucrative form of criminal activity,” he said.CNN has reached out to the military junta for comment.© 2025 Cable News Network.

But the regulator, the Environment Agency, has by its own admission struggled to act.\"I want to give the Environment Agency the teeth it needs to tackle all rule breaking,\" said Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds, announcing the proposals.\"With new, automatic and tougher penalties for water companies, there will be swift consequences for offences – including not treating sewage to the required standard, and maintenance failures,\" she said.The plans will be put to a six-week public consultation starting on Wednesday.The English water companies welcomed the proposals, with a spokesperson for trade body Water UK saying: \"It is right that water companies are held to account when things go wrong.\"In recent years the fitting of monitors to all sewage outflows in England has highlighted just how much raw sewage is being discharged, and how few of the rule breaches lead to the Environment Agency taking action.BBC News investigations have identified thousands of occasions when sewage was spilled during dry weather and occasions when treatment works released sewage before they treated their legally stipulated volume.A recent BBC report revealed that the EA attended just 13% of reported pollution incidents and often had to rely on information from the water companies themselves.The government says it's expecting the new system to raise between £50m and £67m each year but it is hoping the policy will make the water companies change their ways. If fines are levied, the government says shareholders will have to cover the cost and it won't be added to customer water bills.For the most serious pollution offences, the enforcement system remains the same. The EA has to take water companies to court and prove to a criminal standard that an offence has been committed \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". If that prosecution results in a conviction the company could have to pay a large fine, possibly in the millions of pounds.The new proposals are focused on more minor offences which happen frequently and have in the past gone largely unpunished.The plans would see automatic financial penalties of up to £20,000 introduced for rule breaches such as failure to report a significant pollution incident within four hours, failure to report spill data properly or if emergency overflow outlets discharge sewage more than three times in a year.For some more serious offences the government wants to make it easier for the EA to take action.So it's proposing that the burden of proof be reduced from \"beyond all reasonable doubt\" - the norm for criminal proceedings - to \"on the balance of probabilities\", which is used in civil cases. The fines which the EA can impose without going to court could be increased to a maximum of half a million pounds.The reduced burden of proof for some offences is already written into law, having been part of the Water (Special Measures) Act which received Royal Assent in February 2025. This six-week consultation is to determine which offences should be included, and the level of the fines.\"Fines of £500,000 are pocket change to billion-pound companies like Thames Water,\" says James Wallace, the CEO of campaign group River Action.\"Higher penalties and urgent, wholesale reform are essential to prevent negligent firms polluting our rivers and short-changing their customers.\"Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

She is also the author of “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”Hamstring tightness is one of the most common complaints I hear from athletes, everyday exercisers and desk workers alike. No matter how much you may try to stretch, the tightness doesn’t go away.And the reason may surprise you: In many cases, “tight” hamstrings aren’t caused by a lack of flexibility — the muscles are tensing in response to instability in other areas.And until you address the root cause, all the hamstring stretching in the world won’t fix the stiffness.In my work with professional athletes, I’ve found that tight hip flexors and weak glutes are most often the culprits, creating an imbalance between the front and back of the hips and a lack of pelvic stability. I rely on a few key exercises to address these issues and resolve hamstring tension — and these movements can make a difference for anyone.Read on to learn how you can improve your hamstring health doing three targeted exercises three times a week.Your hamstrings run down the back of your thighs, connecting your pelvis to your knees. They help you bend your knees and extend your hips, but they also play a vital role in helping keep your pelvis stable. If you have chronic hamstring tension, the problem usually is that they are being pulled into a lengthened, overworked position due to tightness in another muscle group: your hip flexors.At the front of your hips, the hip flexors connect your thighs to your pelvis. They lift your legs toward your body in a movement called hip flexion. When you spend a lot of time sitting or doing repetitive activities that keep the hips flexed, such as biking and running, these are the muscles that become tight and short.Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies. Be part of oneTight hip flexors pull your pelvis forward into what’s known as an anterior tilt, forcing your hamstrings to brace to keep you upright.Think of it this way: Because your hamstrings attach to your pelvis, a forward-tilting position puts your hamstrings on stretch even when you’re standing still.In addition to healthy hamstrings and hip flexors, strong glutes are crucial for pelvic stability. These muscles drive hip extension, the motion that powers you forward when you stand up, climb stairs or walk.But because so much of modern life happens in front of us — sitting, driving, typing — these muscles often become underused and weak. That leaves the hamstrings and lower back to pick up the slack, creating even more tension and fatigue.In other words, the tension you feel in your hamstrings isn’t the problem — it’s a symptom.Stretching your hamstrings when they are already lengthened not only increases your risk of strain or tear, but it can also have the opposite effect — increasing tension because your nervous system senses instability.Your muscles don’t operate in isolation; they take direction from your nervous system. When your body feels unstable, it creates tension as a form of protection.Guarding is why you can’t get rid of that ongoing tension in your bodyRestoring a sense of stability starts with your breath. Deep, controlled breathing aligns your rib cage and pelvis so your core can stabilize your body, signaling to your nervous system that it’s safe to release tension.That’s why any approach to relieving hamstring tension should begin with breath-driven stability — the foundation for the exercises that follow.Important note: Before you start any new exercise program, consult with your doctor or physical therapist. Stop immediately if you experience pain.Begin on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor, hip-distance apart, holding a foam yoga block or rolled towel between your knees. Inhale through your nose, feeling the expansion of your rib cage. Then exhale fully, feeling your ribs draw down and your core engage as you press into your heels, activating your glutes to lift your hips 3 or 4 inches. Avoid lifting too high and arching your back. Inhale, returning your hips to the floor. Exhale and repeat through five repetitions. Do three to five sets.Why it works: Combining diaphragmatic breathing with gentle hip lifts builds muscular strength and balance, restores alignment, and helps release protective tension.Do all three positions on one side, then repeat the sequence on your other side.Position 1: Start in a kneeling lunge with your left leg forward and right knee under your hip on a pad or folded towel. Curl your right toes under behind you and keep your torso upright, hands on hips. Exhale as you bring your ribs down and tuck your pelvis under, flattening your low back and curling your tailbone down until you feel a stretch at the front of your right hip. Raise your right arm overhead and side bend to the left to deepen the stretch. Take three slow, deep breaths, bringing your left ribs down with each exhale to increase the side bend.Position 2: Move to a wider stance with external hip rotation by shifting your left leg out to the left about 4 to 6 inches. Externally rotate your right hip by spinning clockwise on your knee, moving your right foot to the left side of your body behind you. Repeat the pelvic tuck and side bend. Hold for three breaths.Position 3: Keep the wide stance but internally rotate your right hip by spinning counterclockwise on your knee, moving your right foot out to the right side as far as you feel comfortable. Repeat the pelvic tuck and side bend. Hold for three breaths.Why it works: Releasing your hip flexors helps return your pelvis to a neutral position so that your hamstrings are no longer being pulled taut from the front.Stand tall holding a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand, with your weight on your right leg. Keeping your core engaged and a soft bend in your standing knee, hinge forward from your hips while lifting your left leg straight behind you. Your torso and lifted leg should move together like a seesaw as you push your hips back and maintain a neutral spine. Stop when you feel a stretch in your hamstring, then drive through the heel of your standing leg to return upright, squeezing your glute at the top. Do two to three sets of eight to 12 reps per side.The best foam rollers in 2025, tried and tested (Courtesy CNN Underscored)Modification: If you struggle with balance, keep the toes of your nonworking foot lightly touching the floor behind you for stability throughout the movement — just don’t put weight on the foot. You can also hold onto a wall or sturdy surface with your free hand until your balance improves.Why it works: This controlled movement strengthens your hamstrings and glutes through an extended range of motion, building stability and strength in length. By training your nervous system to feel strong and supported as the muscles lengthen, you reduce the need for protective tension and improve functional mobility.For best results, I recommend practicing these exercises in succession a few times per week.If your hamstrings always feel tight, endless stretching won’t help. Focus instead on creating a stable foundation for your hamstrings to function. By restoring balance through hip-flexor release, glute strengthening and breath-driven core control, you can relieve tension, improve mobility and move more easily.Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.

Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines, cutting $500 million in funding for some uses of the technology.But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak. It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.© 2025 Cable News Network.

And one area in particular — a region less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) across — has provided scientists with at least half a dozen remarkably well-preserved dinosaur specimens complete with details of scaly skin, hooves and spikes.The paleontologist Dr. Paul Sereno and his colleagues dub it “the mummy zone” in a new study that aims to explain why this particular area has given rise to so many amazing finds and define exactly what a dinosaur “mummy” is.In the early 1900s, a fossil hunter named Charles Sternberg found two specimens of a large duck-billed dinosaur, Edmontosaurus annectens, in the Lance Formation. The skeletons were so pristine that Sternberg, along with H.F. Osborn, a paleontologist at New York’s American Museum of Natural History, could make out what appeared to be large swaths of skin with discernible scales and a fleshy crest that seemed to run along the reptile’s neck.Sereno, lead study author and a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago, described the initial discovery as “the greatest dinosaur mummy — until maybe the juvenile that we found” in the year 2000.Separated by nearly a century, Sereno and his team’s find shared common traits with Sternberg’s: The skeletons were preserved in three-dimensional poses and showed clear evidence of skin and other attributes that don’t usually survive 66 million years in the ground. “Osborn said in 1912 he knew that it wasn’t actual, dehydrated skin, like in Egyptian mummies,” Sereno said. “But what was it?”Rare look at the last days of the dinosaurs shows they were thriving, scientists sayWhatever it was, “we actually didn’t know how it was preserved,” he said. “It was a mystery.”The new research puts that mystery to rest and can help paleontologists find, recognize and analyze future mummy finds for tiny clues into how giant dinosaurs really looked.Sereno and his collaborators used CT scanning, 3D imaging, electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy to analyze two Edmontosaurus mummies they discovered in the Lance Formation in 2000 and 2001 — a juvenile and a young adult. “We looked and we looked and we looked, we sampled and we tested, and we didn’t find any” remnants of soft tissue, Sereno said.What the team found instead was a thin layer of clay, less than one-hundredth of an inch thick, which had formed on top of the animals’ skin. “It’s so real-looking, it’s unbelievable,” he said.Whereas Sternberg and Osborn referred to the “impression” of skin in their specimens, Sereno’s paper proposes an alternate term — “rendering” — which he argues is more precise.The study lays out the conditions that would produce such a rendering. In the Late Cretaceous Period, when Edmontosaurus roamed what is now the American West, the climate cycled between drought and monsoon rains. Drought has been determined to have been the cause of death of the original mummy found by Sternberg and described by Osborn, and of other animals whose fossils were found nearby. Assuming the same is true of the new specimens, the carcasses would have dried in the sun in a week or two.Then, a flash flood buried the bodies in sediment. The decaying carcasses would have been covered by a film of bacteria, which can electrostatically attract clay found in the surrounding sediment. The wafer-thin coating of clay remained long after the underlying tissues decayed completely, retaining their detailed morphology and forming a perfect clay mask.Researchers unearthed skeleton of extinct ‘hypercarnivore’ that had a taste for dinosaurs“Clay minerals have a way of attracting to and sticking onto biological surfaces, ensuring a molding that can faithfully reproduce the outermost surfaces of a body, such as skin and other soft tissues,” said Dr. Anthony Martin, professor of practice in the department of environmental sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, who was not involved in the research. “So it makes sense that these clays would have formed such fine portraits of dinosaurs’ scales, spikes and hooves.”Dr. Stephanie Drumheller-Horton, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who also was not involved in the study, is an expert in taphonomy, which she described as “the study of everything that happens to an organism from when it dies until when we find it.” She is particularly interested in how these fossils formed.“Dinosaur mummies have been known for over one hundred years, but there has definitely been more emphasis on describing their skin and less on understanding how they fossilized in the first place,” she said via email. “If we can understand how and why these fossils form, we can better target where to look to potentially find more of them.”Together, the two more recently unearthed mummies allowed Sereno and his team to create a detailed update of what Edmontosaurus probably looked like.According to their analyses, the dinosaur, which could grow to over 12 meters (40 feet) long, had a fleshy crest along the neck and back and a row of spikes running down the tail. The creature’s skin was thin enough to produce delicate wrinkles over the rib cage and was dotted with small, pebble-like scales.The clay mask revealed that the animal had hooves, a trait previously preserved only in mammals. That makes it the oldest land animal proven to have hooves and the first known example of a hooved reptile, Sereno said. “Sorry, mammals, you didn’t invent it,” he joked. “Did we suspect it? Yeah, we suspected it had a hoof from the footprints, but seeing it is believing.”The study was published Thursday in the journal Science.Amanda Schupak is a science and health journalist in New York City.Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

He joins Norm Van Brocklin as the only people to reach that mark.Harbaugh had a 66-74 record over a 13-year playing career in the NFL which included stints with the Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Baltimore Ravens and the then named San Diego Chargers.As a head coach, he compiled a 44-19-1 record with the San Francisco 49ers between 2011 and 2014 and Thursday’s victory improves his record with the Chargers to 16-9 in his two seasons back in California.The win over Minnesota at SoFi Stadium helps get the Chargers’ season back on track after the team lost three of their last four.The game began strongly for the home team, with LA leading 21-3 at halftime with three touchdown drives in the first two quarters.The Vikings got their only touchdown of the game with 4:36 left in the third quarter when back-up quarterback Carson Wentz connected with Jordan Addison to reduce LA’s lead to 14 points.But Minnesota failed to score again after that and the Chargers added 13-straight points to close out the victory and improve to 5-3.Herbert finished the game 18-of-25 passing for 227 yards, three TDs and one interception, while also running for 62 yards.According to the NFL, it was Herbert’s third game of his NFL career with three-plus touchdown passes and more than 50 yards rushing, something no other quarterback in Chargers history has ever done.After the game, Harbaugh was effusive in his praise of his star QB.“It’s just another thing about Justin Herbert that I don’t know how he does it,” Harbaugh told reporters. “It’s nothing but respect.“To be able to actually throw an interception and then come back the next drive – that’s the great ones who can do that. The great, great ones. Just measure what they do after something goes bad, after there’s an interception. That’s the worst thing that can really happen to you as a quarterback. And then chart what they do with the next drive. That shakes a lot of guys. Not Justin Herbert, not the great ones, back right down the field. … It’s incredible.”For the Vikings, they slip to 3-4 and continue to struggle on offense with starting QB JJ McCarthy still sidelined with an ankle injury.McCarthy’s replacement, Wentz, came into the game nursing a shoulder knock and looked out of sorts all evening as he made his fifth straight start for the team.Minnesota had just 164 total yards on offense while the Chargers had 419. LA also dominated the time of possession, having over 39 minutes of the ball while the Vikings had just under 21 minutes.Wentz’s interception midway through the fourth quarter halted any slim hopes Minnesota might have had about a dramatic comeback. And with the team’s playoffs hopes on the line, the return of McCarthy – who was the emergency third QB on Thursday – is expected before their Week 9 game against the Detroit Lions.The only bright spot for the Vikings on Thursday was their star wide receiver Justin Jefferson having his own moment of history. Jefferson joined Hall of Famer Randy Moss (8,375 yards) and Torry Holt (8,156) as the only players with at least 8,000 receiving yards in their first six seasons in NFL history, per NFL Research.© 2025 Cable News Network.

No cause of death was announced.Kramnik, a grandmaster and the world chess champion between 2000 and 2007, had repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games.Naroditsky denied the accusations and, during his final Twitch stream last week, spoke about the mental toll Kramnik’s campaign had taken on him.“The problem is, ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,” he said, adding: “The issue is just the lingering effect of it.”Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing and wrote on X Thursday that he hopes the “real truth about the curcumstances (sic) and cause of this tradegy (sic) will be revealed, despite all attempts to hide it.”Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday, FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich said that the organization “thought that Vladimir’s accusations were reckless and ungrounded.”He added: “Our fair play commission is looking into that. And I personally, and our management board, decided to pass it to our ethics commission for investigation, an independent investigation. We do believe that any kind of bullying or harassment is intolerable in any life activity — in sports, in chess in particular.”Dvorkovich explained that “any kind of sanction is possible” for Kramnik, though that decision ultimately rests with the ethics commission.“In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people’s reputation but their very well-being,” Dvorkovich said in a statement released by FIDE on Wednesday.“When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks — a particularly serious concern in today’s environment.“The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable. The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.”10-year-old chess prodigy becomes youngest female player to defeat grandmasterWhen contacted by CNN Sports, Kramnik pointed to his recent interview with Russian outlet Match TV, during which he described FIDE’s investigation as “insulting,” “unfair” and “orchestrat(ing) a shameful campaign of harassment against me and my loved ones”He added in the interview: “The fact that FIDE makes such statements is unacceptable neither from a moral nor a legal point of view.”According to The Associated Press, Kramnik first accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess last October without providing substantial evidence.Since Naroditsky’s death, other players have spoken out against Kramnik, with five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen calling his conduct “horrible” and world No. 2 Hikaru Nakamura describing his campaign against perceived cheating as “nonsense” and “insane.”“It’s time to stop worrying about the backlash. I am calling on the FIDE EDC (Ethics and Disciplinary Commission) to remove Vladimir Kramnik from the FIDE record books, revoke his title, and disqualify his world championship,” streamer and woman grandmaster Nemo Zhou wrote on X.“Chess is one of the most beloved games in the world and should be a place for kindness and inclusion.”Without naming Kramnik, grandmaster Nihal Sarin wrote on X that Naroditsky had faced “relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations” which caused “immense pressure and pain.”“Daniel’s smile faded after the attacks began,” Sarin added.Kramnik has long waged a war against what he believes to be widespread cheating in online chess, describing it as a “rapidly spreading desease (sic)” in a “fair play in chess” fundraising campaign launched earlier this year.Naroditsky was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. After learning to play chess at the age of six, he would go on to earn the title of grandmaster – the highest title awarded by FIDE – before he was a senior in high school.A popular figure online, he had half a million subscribers on his YouTube channel and 340,000 followers on Twitch, as well as being hired by the New York Times in 2022 as a chess columnist.Speaking on “The Lead,” FIDE president Dvorkovich described Naroditsky as “a bright person, a grandmaster, educator, commentator. He was loved by many.”CNN’s Anna Chernova and Hanna Park contributed to reporting.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Oh, not a big baseball fan you say? No worries. The NBA tipped off its season this week, so you’ve got 12 games to pick from. Eight NHL teams face off, too. Saturday promises to be a huge day for college football (especially if you’re in Michigan, home of the annual grudge match between the Wolverines and Spartans). And on Sunday it’s week eight of the NFL season — we’re all wondering if the New York Jets can finally win a game.The smorgasbord of sports and the passion it will incite among fans led us to wonder: What is America’s best sports city? We asked nine writers to make their case.It’s the most scenic sports city in America. From the open end of Husky Stadium, Lake Washington gleams and Mount Rainier towers. Some fans arrive for Washington Huskies home football games via boat — after, yes, sailgating, sometimes even on the Montlake Cut, where the University of Washington’s rowing crew trained to win Olympic gold in 1936, before their story became a book and a movie, “The Boys in the Boat.” Six miles away, in downtown Seattle, the green, tree-lined Railroad Way connects the city’s waterfront to its stadium district. Those who traverse it can settle into seats above left field at T-Mobile Park and take in Major League Baseball and Puget Sound simultaneously.Start there to understand why Seattle is America’s best sports city. Add this: an emphasis on women’s sports and inclusivity no other metropolis can match. Seattle’s WNBA team, the Storm, is owned and operated by three local businesswomen. Women have held or hold high-level positions for the Storm, Seattle Reign FC (National Women’s Soccer League), the Sounders (MLS), the Mariners (MLB), UW and Seattle University. Fans here show up for women’s sports. The Storm always rank among league leaders in attendance.If titles matter, Seattle has those, too. The Storm won four between 2004 and 2020. The Seahawks triumphed in the Super Bowl in 2014. The Sounders seized MLS Cups in ‘16 and ’19. We have an NBA championship (Supersonics, sigh, 1979). And the Seawolves, of Major League Rugby, snagged back-to-back shields in ’18 and ’19. UW, in 1991, claimed a share of college football’s national championship. The 2025 Mariners reached the American League Championship Series for only the fourth time in 49 years. Even losing Game 7 against Toronto felt like the beginning of much more — a golden age of sports here, perhaps.In the Seattle sports scene, there’s variety: rugby, cricket, cheerleading, roller derby, ultimate Frisbee, Australian football and arena football. Just don’t mistake breadth for a lack of star power. Seattle sports was: Lenny Wilkens, Gus Williams, Shawn Kemp, Gary Payton, Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, Ichiro, Felix Hernandez, Steve Largent, Cortez Kennedy, Walter Jones and Marshawn Lynch. Seattle sports is: Cal Raleigh, Julio Rodriguez and Nneka Ogwumike.Our fans are loyal; our venues, sustainable. Climate Pledge Arena, home to the NHL’s Kraken and the Storm, is the world’s first zero-carbon certified sports space, complete with electric Zambonis and powered by 100 percent renewable energy.We loved and supported soccer before the rest of America came around. We loved and supported the WNBA long before its widespread popularity ballooned. We register decibel-quakes in our football stadium just through our roars and stomping.If “best” sports city in America is defined, simply, as most teams and most titles, then Seattle is not that. But if fans want to feel sports and experience sports and live sports, there’s simply no better, nor more distinct, place.Greg Bishop is a senior writer for Sports Illustrated and lives in the Seattle area.Los Angeles is not the tinseltown caricature of superficiality. Those of us who call it home know better. L.A. is the Diaspora Capital of America, the Creative Capital of America, the Fitness Capital of America.And yes, the Sports Capital of America, a rich mixture of excitement and longing, vulnerability and swagger.It has 11 major professional sports teams and the most culturally and globally relevant teams anywhere. The Dodgers consistently have the highest regular season home attendance in Major League Baseball, averaging nearly 50,000 fans a game, with big followings in Mexico and Japan. The Los Angeles Clippers play in the new Intuit Dome, the most innovative fan-experience arena in professional sports. Powerhouse rivals UCLA and USC have won more NCAA Division I team championships combined, 239, than any other two universities in a single city. The owner of the Los Angeles Lakers agreed to sell a majority stake in the franchise in June; the agreement valued the Lakers at a record $10 billion.L.A. is a sprawling, alluring destination that attracts every significant sporting event. The city will host the World Cup next year, followed by the 2028 Summer Olympics. Athletes flock to train here in the offseason, build their brands, buy or rent second homes. They all believe they can become great here.On any given summer Sunday, you can go to Venice Beach and watch street ball sensation Ryan “Hezi god” Carter drop 39 points in the Veniceball League by the ocean. Professional beach volleyball took off in Manhattan Beach. L.A. is a youth sports mecca, where just two years ago Louis Lappe hit a walk-off homer that lifted El Segundo’s Little League All-Stars to Little League World Series champs. Sports Business Journal named L.A. the No. 1 soccer market — one that includes the upstart Angel City FC, one of the most valuable teams in women’s sports.L.A. is not just the city where the greatest collection of superstar athletes performed — Koufax, Magic, Kareem, Kobe, Shaq, Serena, Leslie, Kershaw, Kwan, Valenzuela, Ohtani, LeBron, etc. It’s where Wayne Gretzky, playing for the Los Angeles Kings, popularized hockey in California. It’s where David Beckham transformed Major League Soccer. Venus and Serena Williams left the courts of Compton and dominated women’s tennis for a quarter century, winning a combined 48 titles.Where else will you find LeBron James doing a cameo in Tyler the Creator’s latest music video, or see college hoops phenom JuJu Watkins on a billboard and then watch her L.A.-filmed documentary series? Many years ago, I ran into the great James Earl Jones (may he rest in peace) at a backyard cookout in L.A. I sat next to him at a picnic table while he ate his ribs, and we talked about “Field of Dreams,” the sports-movie classic about the spiritual power of baseball.L.A. is that city.Kevin Merida is the former executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, a former senior vice president of ESPN and a former managing editor of The Post.It’s easy to argue for a major metropolis as America’s best sports city. New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have so many big-time franchises they can’t keep them straight. The Jets used to play in Queens and the Nets used to play in New Jersey, but now the Nets are in Brooklyn and the Jets are in Jersey.Dizzying.Good for them, I guess. I prefer a town where the folks share sporting passions unanimously, not neighborhood by neighborhood. Where new sports find a warm welcome, and sports history has a place of honor. I speak of Kansas City.Start with this: The NFL rules the nation, and the Kansas City Chiefs rule the NFL. Kansas City — ranked No. 31 in metro-area population but punching way above its weight — has played in five of the last six Super Bowls. Won three. Finished second in the others.Kansas City also has a baseball team with a couple of World Series trophies and history’s best third baseman: George Brett. He is one of only five players with 3,000 hits, 300 home runs and a .300 lifetime batting average.As for stars of newer vintage: In Patrick Mahomes, a rare three-time Super Bowl MVP, and all-star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Kansas City boasts a dazzling still-in-their-prime sports duo.Wanna ding K.C. for lacking an NBA franchise? The city has something better: University of Kansas basketball. KU is the cradle of the sport. An overtime game in the historic Phog Allen Fieldhouse is the best college athletic vibe in America.Speaking of college athletics: Kansas City is rekindling one of the oldest and fiercest college rivalries in America. That stuff about harmonious neighborhoods does not apply to Kansas versus the University of Missouri, a tradition busted up by conference realignments but coming back to life.Kansas City cherishes the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. Nowhere is the role of athletes as engines of culture and social progress so delightfully explained and celebrated. As for the future of sport, Kansas City is the first place on the planet to build a stadium just for women’s professional soccer.K.C. is Soccer City. Has been for decades: The same Lamar Hunt who conceived of what is now the American Football Conference and its dominant Chiefs was also the visionary behind European football in the U.S. Next year, the World Cup will pay homage to Kansas City’s long history at the forefront of North American soccer by staging multiple matches here.The entire World Cup tournament will have Kansas City fingerprints. Games in Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, California and Washington will all be played in stadiums designed by architects in Kansas City — the world capital of sports stadium design.David Von Drehle is a former Washington Post columnist and editor.Before I was born, it was made clear to my brothers and hence me upon my birth that North Side, South Side, West Side or the suburbs, we could all agree on one thing in Chicago: You rooted for the Bears, the Bulls, the Blackhawks and whichever baseball team your family forced you to support because your grandfather did.That is one of the many things that makes Chicago special. You would be hard-pressed to find a native who didn’t weep over the World Series titles of the 2016 Cubs or the 2005 White Sox; who couldn’t tick off multiple reasons Michael Jordan is the greatest of all time; and those of a certain age who can’t still close their eyes and envision the “Super Bowl Shuffle” without the slightest whiff of embarrassment.I once almost made a friend of my then-7-year-old son cry when he got into our car wearing a Red Sox hat. “Brandon, what are you doing?” I chided him. “We have TWO baseball teams. Pick one.”We didn’t see much of Brandon after that and my son Alec, now 27, still blames me. But I contend I saved his friend from much worse abuse had he worn the Red Sox hat in a less-charitable mother’s car.To be defined by our blind loyalty, however, doesn’t fully capture our passion. We are a smart group. We can, for example, quickly calculate how many offensive coordinators helped doom Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in his eight seasons with the team (six).We are also smart enough to know that his 251 sacks during that period, which vaulted him to first place on the list of most-sacked quarterbacks in franchise history, probably contributed to his general disposition.Earlier this year, an actual study calculated the number of tweets, Google searches and Reddit posts containing “heartbroken language” made by each NFL fan base the previous season. The survey dubbed us No. 1 on its list of most heartbroken fans in the league.I’m not sure that’s altogether fair. Makes us sound soft. But we’ll take a No. 1 ranking.The truth is, we are a reasonable people. We know who we are and that means we do not adopt more successful teams from other cities, no matter how young and impressionable we may be. Rather, we stick by our own, root them on passionately and every 100 years or so, if we’re lucky, we are rewarded for our loyalty.Melissa Isaacson is an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism and was a longtime Chicago Tribune sportswriter.Sports fans across the country laughed when Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell talked about kicking opponents in the teeth and biting kneecaps during his opening news conference in 2021. But most missed Campbell’s point in the seconds before he made that comment: his promise that the Lions would take on their city’s identity.“This city has been down, and it found a way to get up. It’s found a way to overcome adversity,” Campbell said.The Lions, who have never reached a Super Bowl and went 0-16 in 2008, resembled the city. Just seven years before Campbell’s arrival, Detroit emerged from a historic municipal bankruptcy.Many Detroit fans have been knocked down and found a way to get back up. Lions hats emblazoned with “Grit” embody the hard work and dirty hands Detroiters display on auto factory lines. The ubiquitous “Bless you boys” catchphrase during the 1984 Tigers World Series championship season reflected an entire city’s underdog spirit and hope during that improbable year. We loved both the “Bad Boys” and the “Goin’ to Work” Pistons championship teams for their toughness and blue-collar swagger.We’ve also watched Red Wings greats such as Gordie Howe retire at 52, and Chris Chelios play until he was 48. It reminded us of our fathers or uncles at the plant.Now, Campbell has turned the Lions into championship contenders. The players found a way to pair their style of play with the city’s fierce work ethic. The Tigers and Pistons have also added to Detroit’s culture of resilience with their unexpected runs to the playoffs in 2024.We’re not Los Angeles, New York or Chicago. We don’t try to be. We’re too busy surviving hard times and making things better.That’s what makes Detroit’s bonds with our sports legends special.Consider how Pistons great Dave Bing left his steel company to become mayor during the most difficult economic times. He tackled a roughly $300 million deficit when he entered office. Jalen Rose of the University of Michigan Fab 5 faithfully visits his Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to help our educational system. Roger Penske runs his billion dollar company here.Then there’s Isiah Thomas, former Piston and NBA Hall of Famer, who spoke during a recent visit with the University of Detroit-Mercy basketball team.“There’s two rules: How bad do you want it and how hard are you going to fight for it ... . ” Thomas said. “Either you’re fighting to keep it or you’re fighting to get it.”Darren A. Nichols is a freelance writer in Detroit.Scott Entsminger was from Mansfield, Ohio, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland. He worked for General Motors for 32 years before retiring; he loved to garden, and to fish and to play guitar in a band with friends called the Old Fogies Band. He had a wife, a teenage son and three dogs. And he died on July 4, 2013, at the far-too-young age of 55.His obituary is a standard one. Except for two sentences:A lifelong Cleveland Browns fan and season ticket holder, he also wrote a song each year and sent it to the Cleveland Browns as well as offering other advice on how to run the team. He respectfully requests six Cleveland Browns pallbearers so the Browns can let him down one last time.On Legacy.com, you’re allowed to comment on obituaries in a separate Guest Book section. (Note to my children: Please do not attach a comment section to my obituary.) Entsminger’s page goes on and on, hundreds of entries, almost all of them Browns fans, laughing with this dead man they never met, sharing their own memories of this franchise that’s determined to follow and haunt them into the grave and beyond. You can kinda tell reading all the entries: This is how they think they’re gonna go, too. This is what it’s like to be a Browns fan. It’s what it was like to be a Browns fan when Entsminger died 12 years ago. It’s what it’s like to be a Browns fan now.I’m not sure there would be a bigger story in sports than the Cleveland Browns winning the Super Bowl. Other teams and cities have known pain: the Bills, the Vikings, everything Detroit. But no one knows pain like Cleveland does, from The Fumble to The Drive to The Decision to The Shot to The Curse (take your pick from Game Seven World Series heartbreaks, 1997 or 2016). Even the one title the city did win, the LeBron title in 2016, ended with LeBron leaving two years later and the Cavaliers sinking into irrelevance immediately afterward. (Followed by their recent uptick to postseason face-planters.)But the Browns — who have never reached a Super Bowl and haven’t been close in nearly 40 years — represent the pain most stoically and resolutely. They’re the sad sack losers who don’t deserve this city’s love — who once, in fact, abandoned this city — but will have it forever nonetheless. To love the Cleveland Browns — the team, after building a new stadium in suburban Brook Park in 2029, will be abandoning the city once more — is to give your soul to something that will cause you nothing but heartache and pain, willingly, happily, unreservedly, for the rest of your life. And even, as the late Scott Entsminger could tell you, after that. Nothing could be more futile. Nothing could be more noble.Will Leitch is a Washington Post columnist.Last year, a massive winter storm dumped four feet of snow on western New York, as massive winter storms are wont to do.Thousands of Buffalo Bills fans, anticipating a home playoff showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers, piloted their SUVs, ATVs and snowmobiles to roofless Highmark Stadium. And then, they began shoveling, with the team fueling them with food, coffee and a $20-an-hour wage.Seats, aisles and playing field sufficiently cleared, quarterback Josh Allen threw two touchdowns and rushed for another as the capacity crowd heaved heaps of snow skyward celebrating a victory they personally labored into existence.Buffalo sports fandom is uniquely vocational. A skilled trade. Proud, often punishing work mastered through participation, repetition and solidarity.Our fandom certainly isn’t great because of what our teams have accomplished. New York City boasts a combined 54 major sports championships. Our blue-collar brethren in Detroit enjoy 22 titles, Pittsburgh 16. Buffalo? Zero — our teams have gone zero-for-six in Super Bowls and Stanley Cup finals.No, Buffalo fandom is great because of a lesson I learned in the late 1980s, as the Bills’ Super Bowl era dawned. Then 10 years old, I begged my parents for season tickets we couldn’t quite afford. My assembly-line worker father and church-musician mother, who wanted them as badly as me, agreed — if I paid for my own. Soon, I had a route’s worth of newspaper customers, a seat in Section 127, and each autumn and winter, 80,000 of the most outrageously wonderful friends a kid could ever want.Rooting for Buffalo means backing a postindustrial, half-frozen metropolitan area with fewer people than Fresno, California; Birmingham, Alabama; or Richmond, Virginia. We buy in, show up and hitch our teams’ hard times to our own in pursuit of a better place together.The “Bills Mafia” phenomenon has turned Bills fans into a Bills family in which the team itself is fully engrossed. This is a Bills family, worth noting, that does great good when its adherents aren’t, say, gleefully flinging themselves through folding tables during epic tailgating sessions, as has become madcap tradition.So enjoy your championships and trophies, America. Even if Buffalo must wait another year or decade or century — please, God, no — we’ve built something from the collective ashes of “wide right” and “no goal” and “13 seconds” that is as unduplicated as it is priceless.Dave Levinthal, a Buffalo native, is a journalist in Washington.New Yorkers are, to say the least, a complacent bunch. Our city is the best in the country, according to us, so it follows that it is certainly the best sports city in the country. With at least one team to root for across every league, fandom here is a Choose Your Own Adventure easily accessible via public transit. We deserve no less, considering all we pay in rent.Say you want to root for a spendy clubhouse with a storied history of 27 World Series titles. The Yankees will be happy to have you. Do you prefer instead to suffer endlessly watching a charming band of misfits? The also spendy (post-Bernie Madoff) Mets have you covered. And right next door, you can annually drown your sorrows in honey deuces at the U.S. Open.Meanwhile, the WNBA is the hottest it’s ever been, and no one in the league is hotter than Ellie, the Liberty’s prancing pachyderm. A chic icon fit for a fashion capital. On the NBA side, the surging Knicks are obviously your best bet, and you’ll be in good company at Madison Square Garden with the likes of Spike Lee, Jack Nicholson and Timothée Chalamet. But true sickos like myself can, for some reason, support the Nets. (It’s not my fault that I grew up in Jersey during the Jason Kidd era.)Fans in New York are demanding, which means we have little patience for our problem children, currently including the Jets and Giants. As of the time of writing, they were sitting a combined 2-12 on the NFL season. Part of the beauty of the city, though, is that it’s constantly changing. People move in and out (bye, Aaron Rodgers!); storefronts turn over (hello, new women’s sports bar!). And it all happens faster than Carrie Bradshaw can type “I couldn’t help but wonder.” New York has moved on from players and even, in the case of the Dodgers and Giants, entire franchises. But the next big trade or championship run always seems close on the horizon.Is your team not meeting your high standards? No sweat. Turn off the TV, lose yourself dancing like Elaine at the high-A Cyclones’ “Seinfeld Night” on Brooklyn’s Coney Island, and wait a year or two. Your squad will make a … brand-new start of it, which I recently heard bellowed from the water feature at the gorgeous, revamped LaGuardia Airport.Julie Kliegman is a writer and editor in Queens.I’ve been to Boston numerous times, but I was neither raised in nor live in the Northeast. I have been to Fenway Park once, but never the Boston Garden or Gillette Stadium.But when I thought about the top sports town in America, Boston jumped out as the obvious answer. Russell. Bird. Clemens. Pedro. Manny. Big Papi. Brady. Pierce. Those are icons in basketball, football and baseball — full names aren’t necessary.Boston is one of two cities whose teams have won a championship in all four major U.S. sports (baseball, basketball, football, hockey) since 2011. And Los Angeles, the other city that has won all four in the last 15 years, has a major advantage — it has eight teams in those major sports. Boston only has four.The Red Sox won perhaps the most memorable baseball playoff series ever — coming from 0-3 down to defeat the New York Yankees in 2004. The Patriots’ six titles between 2001 and 2018 add up to the rare dynasty that lasted for almost two decades. The Celtics have 18 titles — more than any other NBA franchise. The Lakers have 17, and several of them were won while the team was in Minnesota.Fenway is probably the best stadium in baseball. The city also has Bill Simmons, who is one of the most influential sports journalists in America, particularly for a Gen X-er like myself. Simmons lives in the L.A. area, but grew up in Boston and is still a superfan of his hometown teams. I vacillate between loving and being annoyed by Simmons, but his articles and now podcasts have shaped my sports fandom and appreciation for the Boston sports scene.I don’t want to be a complete Boston booster. Back in the 1970s, Bill Russell described the city as a “flea market of racism.” I assume things have improved since then, but Boston still has a reputation for not being tolerant of African Americans in sports and otherwise. For such a big city, its college sport teams aren’t making much impact. And it’s not known for major events in golf, tennis or other sports — other than the Boston Marathon.The Boston area is the 11th largest metro in the country. Perhaps New York and Los Angeles, the two largest, are the most important for sports. But just as you couldn’t tell the story of America’s founding without talking about the Cradle of Liberty, you can’t tell the story of American sports without featuring Boston.Perry Bacon is a staff writer at The New Republic and a former Washington Post columnist.Post Opinions wants to know: What’s the best sports city in America?

In “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” — about the making of his fraught 1982 album, “Nebraska” — our hero splurges on a Camaro with an ink-black paint job as dark as his headspace. He’s fresh off a boffo tour, struggling to settle into the autumnal quiet of New Jersey, and when the button-down car salesman tells Springsteen that he knows who he is, the Boss responds with a folksy grunt: “Well, that makes one of us.” On the drive home, he flicks the radio on, hears the DJ introducing one of his songs, then abruptly shuts it off."},{"headline":"Can marijuana help you sleep?

While it gives the elephants a powerful and distinctive appearance, it also makes them vulnerable to poaching.Fewer than 30 of these giants remain in Africa, according to the Tsavo Trust, which monitors elephant populations in Kenya’s Tsavo Conservation Area.Most of the surviving super tuskers, also known as “great tuskers,” are found in southern Kenya, where Italian-born photographer Federico Veronesi has spent years tracking and photographing them. His new book, “Walk the Earth,” the culmination of years of work in Kenya and beyond, pays tribute to the elephants he calls “the last witnesses of a world before humans took over the Earth.”As a child growing up in Italy, Veronesi was captivated by African wildlife. That fascination led him to Kenya, where he eventually settled and began photographing the animals he had admired for so long.“Photography is almost like a medium through which I get to stay among the animals and express my love for them,” said Veronesi.Elephants became his central focus, not just for their grandeur, but for the way they seemed to embody the soul of Africa for him. “When you see an elephant walking through a savanna,” he reflected, “it’s so evocative, like everything about Africa is in that one scene.”The book is rooted in Veronesi’s encounters with some of Kenya’s most iconic elephants. One of the most significant came in 2010, when he first saw Tim, the legendary super tusker of Amboseli National Park.“We were waiting as the elephants made their daily walk from the woodlands to the marsh,” he remembered, “when this massive bull appeared with tusks so long, they nearly touched the ground.”For Veronesi, it was as if a childhood dream had become reality. Tim reminded him of tales of Ahmed, a great tusker so revered in Kenya that in the 1970s, President Jomo Kenyatta declared him a “living monument” and assigned him armed guards for protection.Last of the ‘Super Tuskers’: Saving Kenya’s majestic megafauna“Through the book I also wanted to show different aspects of elephants’ lives,” Veronesi said, “such as courtship with Tim, fighting, mud-bathing, swimming, reaching up for branches and social relationships.”Veronesi also sought to highlight the diversity of habitats where elephants live across Africa, from the deserts of Namibia to the Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater and Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe.Veronesi’s favorite image is one of Balguda, “probably the greatest tusker alive at the moment,” as described in his book. Balguda was only known from occasional sightings during aerial patrols and Veronesi spent years looking for him.In August 2023, in a remote corner of Tsavo, Balguda finally appeared. “I still can’t believe that I finally managed to see and photograph him, to have breathed the same air as him. The image of him walking in the riverbed will probably remain with me forever – one of my most intense encounters in the wild,” Veronesi writes in the book.“I always told myself, if I find him, then I will do the book,” he added.“Walk the Earth” is Veronesi’s third photography book, and he has been working on it for the past five years. It highlights the threats elephants face today: habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and the continued danger of trophy hunting, especially for the few remaining great tuskers.Veronesi has long used his photography to help protect wildlife. He says he donates images to conservation organizations, contributes to awareness campaigns and has spoken internationally, including in China, where he presented his wildlife photos to raise awareness about ivory demand.Veronesi strives to not only document elephants as specimens, but to portray them as individuals. “The goal is always to make the viewer connect with the animal, to look into its soul somehow,” he said.That connection requires patience and perspective. He often positions his camera low to the ground, so the elephant seems to tower over the frame. Many of his most powerful images are in black and white.“Elephants have this incredible aura of calm patience,” he said. “They convey a sense of wisdom, of knowledge. And at the same time, they’re extremely social and caring for each other.“They make everything seem fine. Like the whole world is grazing and nothing is happening.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

It was the mid 1970s, and he was with friends outside a shopping mall in the northern suburbs of his hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa. Someone may have looked the wrong way at a stranger’s girlfriend – his memory is fuzzy. What isn’t fuzzy is the sight of that stranger pointing a .45 Magnum in their direction.Luckily the situation de-escalated, and everyone walked away that day. But Ziman estimates by the time he was 50 he’d had a gun pulled on him 15 to 20 times. “I have to consider myself really lucky,” he said. Unsurprisingly, he said he’s “always been very anti-gun.”Ziman is a commercial photographer and filmmaker-turned-artist who resides in Los Angeles today. For over a decade he has made weapons the focus of his work, using tens of millions of hand-threaded beads to turn artifacts of war into artworks.“I want to talk about the proliferation of weapons around the world and the militarization of police forces,” he explained.His series “Weapons of Mass Production” recently concluded with Ziman’s most ambitious work to date: an entire fighter jet.Each artwork in the series has its own connection to South Africa’s recent past, and together they comprise a beautiful, subversive meditation on a nation’s history of violence.First, he created dozens of mock AK-47 rifles in 2013, adding beads to a wire frame. The AK-47, Ziman said, started as “weapon of liberation” during the apartheid years, then post-apartheid “started showing up in bank robberies, cash-in-transit robberies, home invasions (and) carjackings.”Next, in 2016, Ziman moved on to bedecking a Casspir – a heavily armored, mine-resistant vehicle that was created for the South African police and deployed in townships, which became “a hated symbol of apartheid,” he explained.In 2019, Ziman took on the challenge of beading an entire MiG-21. Why he chose the Soviet era fighter jet – the most produced military jet in the world – requires a little more explanation. In the 1980s, South Africa was involved in both the Angola Civil War (1975-2002) and the South African Border War (1966-1990). The Cold War proxy conflicts pulled in multiple entities, including Cuba, which flew MiG-21s against South Africa’s air force, inflicting loses in what proved a costly venture, financially and politically, for South Africa.Ziman and a team of over 100 artisans took more than five years to complete the artwork, which was revealed at The Museum of Flight in Seattle this summer.First, Ziman had to acquire a jet, which was sourced from a military contractor in Lakeland, Florida.“It was in pieces and not in great condition, but it was absolutely perfect for us,” he said. Ziman’s team removed the engine, loaded the rest onto a flatbed truck and took it to his studio in LA.Much of the design work was completed on the plane itself, using sheets of paper stuck to its aluminum panels. These sheets would be detailed using colored tape, then removed and shipped to South Africa. There, artisans from Zimbabwean and Ndebele communities in Johannesburg, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces began to recreate the panels in beads.The largest of the panels were over 20 feet wide and weighed 30-40 pounds once completed. The team estimates the jet, which is 51 feet long and 24 feet wide, is covered in approximately 35 million beads.“There’s no mechanized way of doing this, everything on that plane is 100% handmade,” said Ziman. “I can’t even begin to think about the hours that have gone into it.”There are easier, quicker ways of adding a splash color. Why beads?“I’d always loved beadwork,” said Ziman. “I’d grown up with it; I had an Ndebele nanny who always brought us beaded stuff.“Even though it took a tremendous amount of skill and this tremendous effort to make anything out of beads, it was looked down on. I always wanted to elevate it to being a fine art.”Many of the artisans employed by Ziman are part of Anointed Hands, a collective of beadworkers overseen by Thenjiwe Pretty Nkogatsi. ﻿“She is intensely passionate about keeping these beading skills alive in the Ndebele community,” he said.Preserving the livelihoods of these artisans became paramount during the Covid-19 pandemic, when other work dried up, said Ziman. But “Weapons of Mass Production” is also out to help the next generation.Through DTCare, the charity arm of international logistics firm DTGruelle (which supported the MiG-21 project), 25 of the artisans’ children and other young people are receiving sponsorship for their education.“We will pay for them through school, through university … as far as they want to go,” said Ziman. So far, scholarship students have studied medicine, nursing and fashion design, and one even plays for Zimbabwe’s under-21 cricket team, the artist added, beaming.The MiG-21 will go up for sale after a US tour, he said, with proceeds funding the education program, as well as art therapy for children in Ukraine.“I love the idea that we take this thing that was built in the Soviet Union … has been donated to us, and we can sell it and put some of that money back into helping some of the civilian population who’ve been so brutalized in the war (with Russia),” he added.Despite his series looking into South Africa’s past, Ziman believes it has ongoing relevance. The project, he said, “is maybe even more pertinent now than when we started.”He highlighted the Casspir police vehicle, one of the inspirations for US military MRAP (Mine Resistance Ambush Protected) vehicles used in the Second Gulf War. Hundreds of US military mine-resistant vehicles would eventually be made available to police departments through the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, and some used on US streets against protestors during the Black Lives Matter movement.“History doesn’t just rhyme, it actually seems to repeat itself,” said Ziman.This story has been updated to clarify the description of the Casspir vehicle and the beadwork artisans.© 2025 Cable News Network.

But identifying fossils in an area accurately dated to just before the extinction event is rare.A key site of interest for paleontologists has been the well-studied Hell Creek and Fort Union Formations, located in what is now Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.Hell Creek has preserved evidence of multiple species of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, as well as rocks, dated to the end of the Cretaceous Period, or just before the dinosaurs went extinct. But the dinosaur community there completely lacked any long-necked species, causing scientists to wonder if those had already disappeared.Researchers unearthed skeleton of extinct ‘hypercarnivore’ that had a taste for dinosaursNow, new research has dated rocks in the Naashoibito Member to the same time period as the Hell Creek Formation, revealing what kinds of dinosaurs lived in different parts of North America just a few hundred thousand years before going extinct.Among the dinosaurs that lived in the Naashoibito Member was Alamosaurus, one of the largest long-necked dinosaurs that ever lived, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.“What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,” lead study author Andrew Flynn, assistant professor in the department of geological sciences at New Mexico State University, said in a statement. “They’re doing great, they’re thriving, and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.”Dinosaur fossils were first found in the San Juan Basin beginning in the mid- to late 1800s.But dating the rock layers containing the fossils is more complicated, Flynn said. First, the layers need to be exposed so they can be studied, and then the rocks themselves must be dated.“These factors make dinosaur-bearing rocks from the last 400,000 years of the Cretaceous quite rare,” Flynn said.  “Additionally, it takes years of work to establish the ages of rocks, with multiple lines of evidence needing to be collected, which sometimes discourages people from going to new areas to work.”Dinosaur eggs from China found to be around 86 million years old, according to ‘atomic clock’ datingThe fossil record is not neatly organized, and some chapters are missing.“Species might have failed to enter the fossil record, they might have been preserved as fossils but not yet discovered, or they might have been discovered but lack essential context, such as precise estimates of geological age,” wrote Dr. Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a related article published with the research. Zanno was not involved in the study.The Naashoibito Member site is problematic because erosion has stripped it of the perfect layers of rock found at other sites in North America, making it difficult to determine when the layers were created, Flynn said.Work at the site to determine a more detailed timeline of dinosaur habitation began in 2011. The team members measured the thickness and location of different rock layers, collected samples for testing and identified all of the spots where fossils were found over the last century and a half. Sample collection lasted about three to four years just for Cretaceous rocks, while another four to five were spent on the overlying rock that shows when mammals lived at the site after the dinosaurs went extinct.One way the team was able to date the rocks was by comparing the samples with Earth’s magnetic field, which periodically changes direction.For instance, right now, magnetic north aligns with the direction of north. But sometimes, magnetic north can align with the direction of south. Scientists have a clear understanding of when these reversals have occurred over time. By measuring the direction of the magnetic field when the rock layers were created, researchers can narrow down the time frame.“The end-Cretaceous mass extinction, fortunately for us, took place during a relatively short period of reversed polarity, which makes it much easier to say what our data correlates to,” Flynn said.I tried to find out if the dinosaur tooth I bought online was real. It didn’t go as expectedThe team also used radiometric dating — or measuring the decay of certain elements in rocks to determine their ages — on sand grains from sandstone in the Naashoibito Member.Their results showed that the dinosaur fossils were from a 380,000-year window leading up to the mass extinction event. The team also determined that mammals appeared about 350,000 years after the mass extinction event.The new study paints a portrait of two very different dinosaur communities divided between the north and south regions of the continent.Both areas had dinosaurs in common, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Torosaurus. Fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs were also found at each location, but they belonged to different groups. There were no giant, long-necked sauropods to be found in the north, which for a long time led some paleontologists to think that after millions of years of pushing the boundaries of evolution with their humongous sizes, they had gone extinct, said study coauthor Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.But they flourished in the south, including Alamosaurus, which reached 100 feet (30 meters) long, a height of 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 meters) and weighed over 30 tons, Brusatte said. The fact that one of the biggest dinosaurs, and one of the largest animals ever to live on Earth, witnessed an asteroid striking the planet truly illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving to the very end, he said.“I can imagine the scene, one minute a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid,” Brusatte said.Part of the reason for the differing groups divided between north and south was likely due to climate conditions, Flynn said.The Naashoibito Member site was like a warm and humid tropical forest, similar to conditions in modern Panama, while the Hell Creek area was at a much lower elevation and included the cooler conditions of an inland sea coastal plain.“They were doing what dinosaurs had been doing for over 150 million years, adapting to their local conditions, dividing up niches in the food chain, varying in size and shape and diet, exhibiting rich diversity across the landscape,” Brusatte said. “There is no sign that these dinosaurs were in any trouble.”‘Dragon prince’ dinosaur discovery is changing how scientists understand T. rexThe new evidence about diverse, late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is exciting, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the School of Earth Sciences at the UK’s University of Bristol. Benton was not involved in the new study, and his previous research has suggested a decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid strike.“However, this is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world,” Benton wrote in an email.“As the authors also show in the paper, in general dinosaurs of the last 6 million years of the Cretaceous were less diverse, falling from 43 species beforehand to 30 species in western North America. We would suggest that there is evidence for overall declines in dinosaurs towards the end of the Cretaceous, with individual rich faunas where climates were favourable.”But Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor within the department of Earth, energy, and environment at the University of Calgary, said she﻿ believes the new findings could change how researchers think about dinosaurs in North America before the mass extinction event.Zelenitsky was not involved in the new research, but her team’s ongoing work in Alberta uncovering fossil eggshells linked to diverse dinosaur species aligns with the findings about stable dinosaur populations.“The research team uncovered compelling new evidence (…) that dinosaurs were still going strong ‘til the very end,” Zelenitsky wrote in an email.The new study may focus on dinosaurs, but the fact that 75% of species on Earth disappeared at the same time contains a lesson that remains applicable today, Brusatte said.“Sudden climate and environmental change can catch animals and ecosystems unaware,” he said, “and can defeat even the strongest and most iconic of species.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

She said she’d offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.Des Cars, who took the role in 2021, said the museum’s weakness lies in the lack of perimeter protection, which she said was a result of “chronic underinvestment in equipment and infrastructure.”The Louvre’s last major renovation was in the 1980s under former French President François Mitterrand, who commissioned Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei to design an entrance befitting the historic venue.The glass pyramid that now forms the entrance to the museum opened to the public in 1989, putting a modern face on a storied institution known for its exhibition of the world’s finest art.Des Cars said that renovation project may have created an illusion of momentum behind the museum being fully modernized. However, she said: “This major modernization project is now 40 years old, with facilities that have outperformed and are at the end of their tether.”The heist unfolded at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday when robbers parked a truck with a mobile ladder outside the gallery. At 9:34 a.m. they triggered an alarm on the second-floor door, which sent a signal to a security post.A security officer inside the auditorium radioed to report an intrusion and staff began evacuating members of the public. Alarms on two high-security display cases were triggered as the thieves cut holes in the glass to grab the jewels.  At 9:36 a.m. police were called. A minute later, a message was broadcast requesting that the doors be closed. By 9.38 a.m. the thieves had left the building.Surveillance teams outside the museum prevented the suspects from setting their vehicle alight but could not prevent their escape on scooters along the banks of the Seine. A law enforcement official said investigators combed the truck for any traces of DNA. One of the two scooters had been retrieved as well as a helmet worn by one of the suspects, the official added.Des Cars said Wednesday the security system inside the Apollo Gallery “worked perfectly” – but that it was designed several years ago to protect against the greatest risks of that time. For example, the high-security display cases that housed the jewels were designed to withstand bullets.“At the time, this was the dominant modus operandi for this type of attack, for precious objects, jewelry, attacks in jewelry stores,” des Cars said. “That’s what the Louvre is protecting itself against.”She said what’s needed now is to adapt the system to a “new type of attack, to new operating methods that had not been envisaged.”The theft had “profoundly shocked” the museum’s staff, French citizens and “all those who love the Louvre,” des Cars said.She suggested measures that could be put in place to enhance the museum’s security, such as fortifying the outer edges of the Louvre and prohibiting cars from parking in the vicinity.  Des Cars said she’s also considering whether it would be possible to install a police station inside the museum.CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

A 1998 peace deal largely ended the bloodshed.Soldier F was not called to give evidence during the one-month trial that was heard without a jury.Defense lawyers did not call any witnesses and said that the core of the case, military statements taken over 50 years ago, were manifestly unreliable, with no independent supporting evidence offered to back the prosecution case.Earlier in the trial the court heard a short statement Soldier F gave to police in 2016, in which he said that while he was sure he properly discharged his duties as a soldier that day, he no longer had any reliable recollection of the events and therefore was unable to answer the officers’ questions.The British government in 2010 apologized for the “unjustified and unjustifiable” Bloody Sunday killings, the deadliest shooting incident of the Troubles, after a judicial inquiry found that the victims were innocent and had posed no threat to the military.© 2025 Cable News Network.

But those farmers, who overwhelmingly supported the president in the 2024 election, say they aren’t feeling the love right now.Trump is facing criticism from many US cattle ranchers after signaling support for increasing low-tariff beef imports from Argentina to ease record beef prices in the United States. The move comes just weeks after US soybean farmers blasted a separate deal with Argentina that they fear will give South American producers a competitive edge in that market.Argentina currently accounts for just over 2% of US beef imports. Under existing rules, it can ship up to 20,000 metric tons a year at a lower tariff rate, with anything above that subject to a 26.4% tariff, according to the US Department of Agriculture.A White House official told CNN the administration plans to raise that quota to 80,000 metric tons, effectively quadrupling the amount of Argentinian beef with low tariffs that can enter the United States.In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said: “Currently, Americans consume 12 million metric tons of beef. 10 million, we produce in this country. 2 million, we import. Out of 12 million, [the Argentine quota] would be 20,000 every quarter. This is not a massive influx in the millions of tons I think that some have thought of beef from Argentina.”But Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle farmer and the senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan farm organization, said: “If Trump goes through with what he outlined, I do believe it’s a betrayal of the American rancher. It’s a feeling that you’re selling us out to a foreign competitor.”On Wednesday, Trump reacted to the backlash from cattle ranchers.“The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” Trump wrote on social media.“It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” he added.In a statement, Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade association for beef producers, said the organization and its members “cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.”The price of beef has climbed significantly this year, up nearly 14% in the past year, according to the latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August. (A fresh read on consumer prices is set to be released Friday.)Becca Jablonski, an agricultural economist who teaches at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Business, said the price increase is fueled by multiple factors.A recent, multi-year drought decreased the amount of grazing land for cattle and made feed grain significantly more expensive, resulting in a shortage of cattle, she said.The shortage has also been made worse by an infestation of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, just across the border in Mexico, significantly curtailing beef imports from that country.Jablonski said that historically the livestock sector barely makes money, but is having a rare positive year, which allows farmers to pay down debts they accrued during unprofitable years.“I think the argument the industry is making is, ‘Let us have one good year,’” she said.In a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the president is keeping his promises to defend farmers and consumers.“President Trump pledged to protect America’s ranchers and deliver economic relief for everyday Americans. The Administration is accomplishing both by expanding beef imports from Argentina to lower consumer prices in the short term while rolling out a new USDA initiative that will support ranchers and expand cattle herd sizes to keep prices lower in the long term,” Kelly said.Lovell said many of the farmers he knows are just scraping by.Big beef: GOP pushback grows over Trump’s call to buy beef from Argentina“It is not uncommon for folks in farming to have a year where they report a loss,” he said. “You cannot look at cattle producers that had one good year and say, ‘Oh my gosh, they are just making out like bandits.’”Lovell blamed price increases on the large meatpacking corporations that buy product from US ranchers and package it for grocery stores.An influx of imported beef would hurt US farmers, he said, because the large meat packers are not required to label what country their beef comes from.There are some signs that support for Trump in farm country has begun to fray. He won 93% of rural counties in the 2024 election, the highest share of any Republican presidential candidate this century, according to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan research organization.But soybean farmers were among the first to feel the pain of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs with China. Since May, China has effectively boycotted American soybeans as a response to Trump’s tariffs.Even before tariffs, the family farming industry in the United States was already hurting. Since 2017, the country has lost more than 17% of its family farms — at least 100,000 operations — according to the USDA.Tariffs may be exacerbating that pain. Farm bankruptcies rose in the first half of the year to the highest level since 2021, according to US courts data.John Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer and the founder of The National Black Farmers Association, said he had never had a problem selling his soybeans until recently.“Now nobody’s buying it,” Boyd said. “The largest purchaser of our soybeans was China, and they haven’t placed any orders. Zero.”“The president thinks his tariffs are the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s putting America’s farmers out of business,” he added.The administration drew backlash last month after agreeing to provide $20 billion in currency support to help stabilize the Argentine peso, a move critics have characterized as effectively bailing out Argentina.A text message, seen by CNN, sent by Secretary Rollins to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that Argentina then used that financial lifeline to strike a deal with China on soybeans.“We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said.“Here we are losing our farms, and the president is helping out a foreign country,” Boyd said of the deal.Earlier this month, sources told CNN the White House was planning to extend a multibillion-dollar bailout for farmers. With the government shutdown stretching past its third week, no plan has materialized yet.Although the USDA has been largely shuttered during the government shutdown, the agency on Wednesday announced a plan it said would “strengthen the American beef industry.”The plan includes expanding ranchers’ access to federal land for grazing and prioritizing grant applications from military veterans looking to enter the industry, among other measures.Lovell said that while the plan may be welcome news to many farmers, he felt it didn’t go far enough to protect the industry.“What US ranchers need is a fair market with the right incentives. We’ve got to encourage rebuilding the cow herd here in the US,” he said.  “This seems to be a quick attempt to control the damage.”CNN’s Kit Maher, Alayna Treene and Bryan Mena contributed reporting.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It’s costing their employers a fortune","level":"info","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/weight-loss-drugs-kff-employer-survey","message":"","news":"MarketsHot StocksFear & Greed IndexLatest Market NewsHot StocksWeight loss drugs are proving to be super popular among many workers with job-based health insurance. But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual Employer Health Benefits Survey, which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also limited Americans’ access to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32nd place last year.A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the medications would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.“You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.“We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.But coverage for 2026 could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.“There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In Europe, Giorgia Meloni became Italy’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini in 2022, while the far-right Alternative for Germany is now Germany’s largest opposition party. The Trump administration has endorsed far-right parties in Europe, and in Argentina far-right libertarian Javier Milei won the presidency in 2023.The UN report, unveiled Wednesday, says changes to welfare systems have made it harder to access benefits by tightening eligibility rules or imposing stricter conditions, contributing to the kind of economic precarity and alienation that drives people to the far right.“These punitive welfare systems increase economic insecurity, erode trust in public institutions and leave millions feeling humiliated and abandoned by mainstream politics,” the report’s author, Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said in a press release.“It is in this void that far-right populists thrive, presenting themselves as champions of those left behind by the ‘elite.’”But he warned: “Their agenda is not to empower people in poverty – it is to further dismantle protections for their own gain.”Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act illustrates this type of “populism of the privileged,” the report argues. The package includes historic reductions to America’s safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and food stamps, and at the same time slashes taxes, resulting “in a massive transfer” of resources from the poorest households to the richest.Growing gaps in incomes are a “major factor” explaining the rise of right-wing populism, says the 19-page report, citing several studies, including one that established “an almost perfect correlation” between income inequality and support for populist parties.The report also notes European Social Surveys – tracking public attitudes, beliefs and behavior – which show that there is a 25% chance unemployed people at the lowest levels of jobless benefits will vote for the far right versus 15% for those who are employed.Higher pension levels, better child allowances and minimum wage legislation also have a “statistically measurable impact” in reducing the likelihood of a vote for the far right.“Thousands of people in poverty I speak with tell me they feel stigmatized and monitored rather than supported,” De Schutter said. “Unless social protection is taken seriously as a human right, far-right populists will continue to reap what has been sown.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

If the answer is yes, newly released recommendations may help relieve your symptoms.Kiwifruit, rye bread and high mineral-content water can help alleviate chronic constipation, according to new dietary guidelines copublished October 13 by the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.About 1 out of every 6 to 7 people are affected by chronic constipation worldwide. In the United States, 9% to 20% of adults have some form of chronic idiopathic constipation, in which the cause of the condition is unknown.Some symptoms of chronic constipation include having a bowel movement fewer than three times a week, hard or lumpy stool, or straining or experiencing pain when pooping.How often should you poop? The answer might not be what you thinkThe guidelines “introduce foods and drinks (e.g., kiwifruit, prunes, rye bread, high mineral content water) and specific supplement interventions into clinical guidance, filling a long-standing gap between research and routine clinical advice,” lead study author Dr. Eirini Dimidi said in an email. “That will help clinicians give clearer, more targeted, and evidence-informed dietary advice, and will allow people to self-manage their symptoms more effectively.”The guidance applies to healthy adults with chronic idiopathic constipation and “did not focus on constipation secondary to other conditions (e.g., neurological disease, pregnancy), so while some recommendations may be applicable, they should be used with caution in these groups, as well as in children,” said Dimidi, an associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.The guidelines did not include a general recommendation for increased fiber intake in a patient’s diet. Rather, they focused on specific foods that could be beneficial, Dimidi added.Certain lifestyle choices or situations, such as low fiber intake, dehydration, lack of exercise, or stress, can cause constipation. As a result, clinicians focus most treatment on dietary changes.Previous dietary advice was broad, such as telling patients to eat more fiber. But these new guidelines, Dimidi said, suggest “incorporating evidence-based foods and drinks in your diet, such as consuming 2-3 kiwifruits a day.”Unlike other recommended food such as prunes, kiwifruit is simple to incorporate into your diet.“With kiwifruit, because it’s so well-tolerated, you usually can just step right into that dose, as opposed to prunes, for example, where you want to more gradually work up to that dose of six to eight prunes per day,” said Dr. William Chey, professor and chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. He was not involved in the new research.Kiwis can increase stool bulk and water content, enhance protein digestion, and smoothen the movement of food, fluids and waste in the digestive tract. The small fruits also improve the amount of time it takes for waste to pass through your intestine and have natural prebiotic effects, such as improved digestion and reduced gut inflammation.Kiwis are also palatable and soft, which makes them easy to eat, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the study.You can also eat a kiwi’s skin or peel, which has extra fiber. But avoid heating a kiwi, since high temperatures destroy the enzyme that smoothens gut movement, Choudhary added.Foods such as prunes, rye bread, flaxseeds, oranges, yogurt, beans and oatmeal can also help with chronic constipation.For those who like dairy, you could “take a cup of yogurt, make it 8 ounces, any yogurt of your choice because all yogurts have probiotics, and take a heaped tablespoon full of crushed flaxseeds,” said Choudhary, an expert with the American Gastroenterological Association.Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies. Be part of oneOther alternatives include dietary supplements, such as psyllium, which helps your intestine move stool along and reduces your body’s cholesterol absorption from food.“That dosage is at least 10 grams of fiber per day. And again, the general rule is, start low and go slow. So start with 3 grams and gradually work your way up to 10 plus grams per day of psyllium to achieve the benefits,” said Chey, incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology.Physical activity is also an important lifestyle change that patients with chronic constipation can incorporate.Even something as simple as walking increases the effectiveness of the digestive tract, Choudhary said.The new recommendations were based on findings of four systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at over 75 randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions for chronic constipation.Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.
