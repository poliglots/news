[{"details":"People in Jamaica are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which is forecast to unleash destructive winds and bring catastrophic flooding to the Caribbean nation in the coming hours.Melissa was upgraded to a category five hurricane - the maximum strength - early on Monday, the US-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.The authorities fear that Melissa, which has already been blamed for the deaths of four people on the island of Hispaniola, could become the strongest hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.The Jamaican government has ordered evacuations for parts of the capital, Kingston, and the entire island has been classed as \"threatened\".If it continues on the forecasted track, its core is expected \"to move near or over Jamaica tonight and Tuesday, across south-eastern Cuba Tuesday night, and across the south-eastern Bahamas on Wednesday\".The storm is particularly slow moving, which makes it very dangerous in terms of expected rainfall amounts.Forecasters warn that destructive winds and life-threatening storm surges are expected to hit Jamaica overnight or early on Tuesday.Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has ordered the immediate evacuation of several vulnerable communities across the island.At least three people are known to have died and hundreds of homes have been flooded in Haiti as Melissa brought torrential rainfall to the island of Hispaniola.Local media identified the victim as a 79-year-old man who had been swept away by  floodwaters in the capital, Santo Domingo.When hurricanes pass over the ocean they churn up creatures from the deep – a chance to feast for predators brave enough to weather the storm.","headline":"Hurricane Melissa could be strongest to ever hit Jamaica","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dr0z57nygo","message":"People in Jamaica are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which is forecast to unleash destructive winds and bring catastrophic flooding to the Caribbean nation in the coming hours.

Besides Thailand and Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam also signed deals with the US. And while they were not able to budge tariff rates, they managed to negotiate some goods exemptions.\"Trump was here for a photo op… this was just another feather in his cap,\" says Joseph Liow, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.But, he adds, the thinking was that \"since he'll be here, let's make the best of it\" and Asian leaders would have leveraged on his attendance to \"broaden his aperture about the convergence of interests between US and Asia\".Its main advantage is that it can draw larger countries, who see the summit as a easy way to engage all of the region's leaders in one room. This year, besides Trump, leaders from China, the European Council, Canada, Brazil and South Africa also attended the summit.It's had some achievements over the years on the economic front, developing a more integrated economy across the region and securing free trade agreements with other world powers.But many have increasingly questioned its effectiveness in solving regional issues, from air pollution caused by Indonesian forest fires to competing South China Sea claims.Even at this week's summit, the grouping continued to urge the military government to stop the war and seek a peaceful solution - requests that the junta has ignored these last four years.The grouping also noted the junta's invitation to observe their upcoming general election in December and responded by stressing \"the importance of free and fair\" elections and the need to stop the violence first. This was as tough as Asean could get.One reason is that it is not a trade or economic bloc like the European Union, nor does it maintain any standing troops like Nato or the UN. Asean therefore has very few levers at its disposal to put pressure on member states, apart from diplomacy.But the main reason, experts say, is its core principle of non-interference in member states' internal affairs. Asean advocates says this is what keeps it united, and that it can quietly exert pressure effectively behind the scenes – but detractors say it makes it toothless.\"When it comes to political crises, it's mission impossible for members to give up sovereignty and give in to the Asean greater good,\" says Huong Le Thu, deputy director of the Asia programme at the International Crisis Group, who adds that this is \"Asean's weakest link\".While another of Asean's fundamental principles is settling disputes peacefully, in reality it  \"does not really have a major appetite for conflicting countries to sit down and thrash things out\", notes Prof Liow.\"People who criticise Asean for its inability to get its house in order, they are absolutely right. So unless Asean can handle more pressing issues, its relevance will always get called into question… And really the fundamental question for Asean is, at what cost unity?\"The fact that the grouping could not prevent simmering border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia from erupting into war in July, is yet another example of \"Asean fragility\", points out Dr Le Thu, given that South East Asia prides itself as a region with little violent conflict between member states in recent decades.It is criticism like this, though, that make the resolution of the Thai-Cambodia war a rare win for Asean, with Trump's visit burnishing that success. Experts say that while the agreement signed on Sunday does not actually resolve the fundamental border dispute, it is still a positive start with concrete steps for de-escalation.Kuala Lumpur also saw US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reach a \"framework deal\" on rare earths and US tariffs with his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng, at a time when many are watching how the latest US-China trade war will end.The deal lays the groundwork for a much anticipated meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao said in an emotional speech that joining Asean was \"a dream realised\" for East Timorese, as clips of the East Timor delegation crying and thanking Asean attendees went viral online.It was a moving moment to witness at the summit, proving that despite its flaws Asean can still hold relevance - and even be cherished.Venezuela's attorney general accuses the US president of hoping to turn his country into a \"colony\".Donald Trump has claimed to have ended another war, this time between Thailand and Cambodia. But what does this latest agreement actually amount to?The Treasury Secretary says the US has enough for the next military payday, but can't pay service members after that.","headline":"Trump gives 'toothless' Asian summit its moment in the sun","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c797qlx93j0o","message":"The headlines will follow Trump as he flies to Japan and then South Korea, for a much-awaited meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

If we're running around Gaza on patrol with weapons, that's not a situation that any country would like to get involved in.\"The King's comments reflect concern from the US and other nations about being dragged into a continuing conflict between Hamas and Israel, or Hamas and other Palestinian groups.Asked if he trusted Hamas to keep its promise to give up any political role in Gaza, he replied: \"I don't know them, but those that are working extremely close to them - Qatar and Egypt - feel very, very optimistic that they will abide by that.\"If we don't solve this problem, if we don't find a future for Israelis and Palestinians and a relationship between the Arab and Muslim world and Israel, we're doomed.\"The main mediation efforts during the war have been carried out by Qatar and Egypt working with the United States.The Jordanians have been part of an international effort trying to deliver aid to Gaza and evacuating sick and wounded children. The King has flown over the territory on three missions parachuting aid supplies.\"Looking over the back ramp was just shocking,\" he said. \"The devastation of that part of Gaza was just a shock to me.\"I've seen it myself, and how we, as the international community, are allowing this to happen is mind-boggling.\"To get children and their guardians out of the territory they must undergo a comprehensive security check by Israel and host countries. The World Health Organization has described the process as \"excruciatingly slow\". The Israeli military group which oversees aid for Gaza - Cogat - insists it places \"great importance\" on facilitating humanitarian aid to Gaza, including the evacuation of patients with \"complex medical conditions\". It stresses the necessity of security checks on individuals travelling through Israeli territory.In her interview for Panorama, Jordan's Queen Rania criticised the international community for, as she put it, failing to stop the war for two years.\"You know what it's like to be a parent over the last two years? To watch your children suffering, starving, shaking in terror, and to be powerless to do anything about it, and to know that the whole world is watching and not to do anything about it. That nightmare, it's the nightmare of any parent, but that nightmare has been the daily reality for Palestinians for the last two years.\"The Queen, who is of Palestinian descent, praised President Trump for his efforts to bring about the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. She said he had used America's diplomatic, military and financial support as leverage on Israel.\"To his credit, Trump was the first president in a long time to actually apply pressure on Israel. Beforehand, when they crossed lines, the US president would just maybe just say a few words of rebuke or they just get a slap on the wrist. President Trump actually got [Israeli PM Benjamin] Netanyahu to actually agree to a ceasefire. And I hope that he continues to be engaged in this process.\"When I asked Queen Rania if she believed a lasting peace was possible, she said hope for this was not naive, but a form of defiance.\"I truly believe that Palestinians and Israelis can exist side by side,\" she said. \"In the current atmosphere, there's too much animosity, too much anger and grief and hatred and cynicism between the two peoples to actually forge a peace on their own. I'm not being naive here. But I think with the push of the international community, that is the only way.\"So many times during the past two years, hope had felt elusive. Choosing hope was not easy… it's hard, it's heavy. But it's the only path that doesn't deny Palestinians or betray their struggle or our humanity.\"The four Scots are back home after the boat they were on was intercepted by the Israeli military last week.Many have been unable to leave the territory since the Allenby Bridge crossing was shut indefinitely on Wednesday.","headline":"International troops won't want to enforce Gaza peace, says King of Jordan","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge5ngz11xpo","message":"Countries would reject being asked to \"enforce\" peace in Gaza if deployed under the Trump ceasefire plan, King Abdullah of Jordan has told the BBC. \"What is the mandate of security forces inside of Gaza?

Destructive winds, especially in the mountains, will begin by this evening, leading to extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages, and isolated communities.”Tropical storm conditions are already ongoing in Jamaica and hurricane conditions will arrive tonight into early Tuesday as Melissa pushes onshore.The Jamaican government issued mandatory evacuation orders Sunday evening for several vulnerable coastal communities, including parts of Kingston, as Melissa intensifies on its approach to the Caribbean nation.“Storm surge is expected mainly over the southern side of the island, and this would be to the east of the center as it starts to, as it approaches the south coast, and as it begins to make impact,” Evan Thompson, the principal director of Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Sunday.A hurricane warning is effect for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions are expected by Monday night. Cuba has also issued a hurricane warning for the eastern provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin. A tropical storm warning has been issued for much of Haiti, and the government of the Bahamas has issued a hurricane watch for the central and southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.Melissa has been moving at a snail’s pace for days and it won’t pick up speed anytime soon as it tracks generally westward until Monday afternoon.Melissa doubled in strength over the weekend as it underwent extreme rapid intensification over exceptionally warm water in the Caribbean.This explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.Jamaica, Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic will face the worst of the storm through Tuesday. Next in line for strong winds, storm surge and flooding rain will be eastern Cuba, the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of ferocious winds. The most extreme winds will likely occur as Melissa tracks over Jamaica on Monday night into Tuesday. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage could be widespread.Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, halting outpatient and elective procedures to ensure more beds are open, according to Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness.Emergency shelters have been “activated” across the country for people living in vulnerable areas, Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie said Sunday in a press conference.Jamaica’s airports are closing. Norman Manley International Airport closed after its last scheduled arriving flight at 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) Saturday evening, according to Daryl Vaz, the minister of transport.“There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane,” Thompson, from Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Saturday. “It’s going to sit there, pouring water while it’s barely moving and that is a significant challenge… as long as what is predicted does take place.”“Now is the time to secure your home, check your roof, windows, and surroundings. Use sandbags or plywood where needed and clear any overhanging branches safely,” Holness, the prime minister, wrote on X. “If you live in a flood-prone area, take protective measures and have an evacuation plan ready”Jamaicans who spoke with Reuters on Saturday acknowledged the danger of a slow-moving hurricane, contrasting Melissa’s sluggish pace to Hurricane Beryl.“It’s gonna slow down business, but it’s nature,” Davis added. “We can’t fight against nature, right?”The United States mainland is not expected to be directly threatened by Melissa. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Mary Gilbert and Linda Lam, along with reporters Billy Stockwell and Max Saltman contributed to this report.","headline":"Jamaica issues mandatory evacuation orders for several areas as Melissa nears","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/25/weather/hurricane-melissa-storm-tracker-forecast-jamaica-haiti-climate","message":"“Do not venture out of your safe shelter,” the NHC said Monday morning.  “Catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely today through Tuesday.

We want our daughter to grow up in this beautiful country. What happened in previous years is regrettable.\"He's since cut budgets for education, pensions, health, infrastructure, and subsidies, and laid off tens of thousands of public sector workers.Supporters, including Trump, hail him for taming inflation - which hit triple figures annually before he took office - cutting the deficit, and restoring investor confidence.His critics, though, argue the price has been job losses, a decline in manufacturing, crumbling public services, a fall in people's purchasing power and an imminent recession.Juliana, who works with children with disabilities in Tucumán province, is concerned that a law to increase funding for people with disabilities - which Milei vetoed, before being overturned - could be \"in danger\" with the president's position strengthened in Congress.\"Our salaries are low, it remains the same, while other things are increasing. We still don't see a change,\" she added.\"You see a lot of poverty,\" she said. \"It's very hard: for retirees, for people with children with disabilities, for young people. There's a lot of unemployment. Many factories have closed.\"That, coupled with a poor election result in Buenos Aires province in September, spooked the financial markets that Milei's cost-cutting agenda may not be politically sustainable.Before this election, doubts had grown about Milei's political future due to some voters tiring of his austerity programme, as well as a series of corruption scandals that had rocked his party.This election turnout was 67.9%, the lowest in a national election in decades, representing widespread apathy with politicians of all stripes.\"Milei has two years left and should try to do what he can,\" said Dardo, a business owner in Buenos Aires. \"I think we're on the right path, but the middle and working classes are suffering too much.\"He is sceptical the support from the US will help, saying \"we're going to have to pay for it at some point\".Others, like political science student Thiago, said they understood the need for fiscal balance but questioned Milei's means.\"There's a lack of investment in hospitals, infrastructure, in people with disabilities,\" he said. \"There's a certain false hope.\"This election result, though, shows that many Argentines remain unwilling to return to the Peronist model Milei blames for decades of economic mismanagement.\"Argentines showed that they do not want to return to the failed model, the model of inflation… the model of a useless state,\" he declared.Financial markets are expected to rally after the win: a sign that, for now, Milei's political survival has also kept his economic experiment alive - and US support in place.The question now is whether ordinary voters start feeling better off, or if the pain of some of his cuts tests people's patience once more.For now, it appears a significant proportion of voters are – once again – prepared to give him time.","headline":"Argentina's Milei wins big in midterms with 'chainsaw' austerity","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw8qpyvqdo","message":"Argentina's President Javier Milei has led his party to a landslide victory in Sunday's midterm elections, after defining the first two years of his presidency with radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.

CAIR said he was detained at San Francisco International Airport.Conservative figures had been urging the Trump administration to expel Hamdi from the United States.Hamdi has appeared as an analyst and commentator on British TV networks. CAIR on Sunday called for his release and accused the Trump administration of detaining him over his criticism of the Israeli government.Reuters was unable to reach Hamdi. CAIR’s deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said Hamdi had previously denied supporting Islamic militants and that the organization’s lawyers had been unable to reach him by Sunday evening.“Abducting a prominent British Muslim journalist and political commentator on a speaking tour in the United States because he dared to criticize the Israeli government’s genocide is a blatant affront to free speech,” CAIR said in a statement.Since January, the Trump administration has pursued a sweeping crackdown on immigration, including increasing social media vetting, revoking visas for people it claims praised the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and deporting student visa and green card holders who have voiced support for Palestinians and criticized Israel’s conduct in the Gaza war.Israel says its offensive is aimed against Hamas and that it tries to avoid killing civilians, but a U.N. commission of inquiry last month assessed that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation.","headline":"US detains British commentator Sami Hamdi in middle of national speaking tour","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/26/us/sami-hamdi-british-commentator-detained","message":"Washington (Reuters) — U.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.The Netherlands is about to head to the polls in a snap general election following the collapse of the Schoof government, and immigration has been a hot topic of debate, particularly how much migrants cost the country's coffers.Her claims appear to be an exaggeration of figures published in a report on the long-term fiscal impact of immigrants in the Netherlands by Jan van de Beek and others.It analysed the lifetime fiscal impact of migrants, dividing them by motive, such as labour, study and asylum, and their region of origin.Therefore, Vlaardingerbroek's comments are an inflation of even the largest cost of immigrants shown in the report.The Cube spoke to various experts who said that while the statistics on which van de Beek et al base their findings may be correct, they have been misinterpreted and do not reveal the true cost of immigrants.\"The latter figure was not based on data,\" said Jan Willem Gunning, professor of development economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. \"It was justified by a single sentence which amounted to a fundamental error: it was an argument for how much tax migrants should pay rather than to what extent the costs of public goods were caused by migrants.\"Essentially, the study miscalculates migration costs by treating all public services as \"rivalrous\", meaning that a good or service's consumption by one person reduces its availability for another person.Things like defence and flood protection are non-rivalrous, while the likes of police services and motorway management do need to be expanded as the population grows.Gunning pointed us to an op-ed that he co-authored with Casper de Vries, professor at the Erasmus School of Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Alexander Rinnooy Kan, former senator and professor of economics and business at the University of Amsterdam.They also said that any extra net costs of migration are offset by additional economic benefits, such as the fact that migrants often work for lower wages and help sustain sectors of the Dutch economy.\"Several studies show that over time, these people become better and more highly educated, so the situation flips,\" he told The Cube. \"They won't have the same skills then as they do now. They may pose a negative effect on the treasury at first, but that then becomes positive.\"Another major criticism of van de Beek's study, and Vlaardingerbroek’s comments, is that they contribute to the harmful stigmatisation of migrants from certain parts of the world by singling them out, such as Africa and the Middle East, according to experts.Migrants' contributions and situations, regardless of where they come from, tend to be the same as Dutch citizens with the same education level, and their contributions grow as time goes on, they said.\"There's no such thing as isolated communities not wanting to assimilate,\" said Leo Lucassen, professor of global labour and migration history at the University of Leiden and director of the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.He said that certain groups of immigrants, such as asylum seekers, start by costing more than they put in because they are kept out of the labour market, but this changes once they are granted working rights.\"In the long run, they do integrate and contribute,\" Lucassen said. \"They become Dutch, and their integration is up and running, despite some cultural differences.\"\"In addition, there are expenses related to the registration, security, and assessment of asylum applications,\" it said.Ultimately, the Dutch welfare state is not facing inevitable collapse due to immigration as the van de Beek study suggests, according to Lucassen.","headline":"Fact check: How much do immigrants cost the Netherlands?","level":"euronews","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/10/27/fact-check-how-much-do-immigrants-cost-the-netherlands","message":"This is Radio Schuman, your new go-to podcast to spice up your weekday mornings with relevant news, insights, and behind-the-scenes from Brussels and beyond.

Malian authorities said the measure was intended to cut off JNIM’s supply lines.The blockade has squeezed Mali’s fragile economy, affecting the price of commodities and transport in a country that relies on fuel imports for domestic needs.Its effects have also spread to the capital, Bamako, where endless queues have stretched in front of gas stations.Mali, along with neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, has for more than a decade battled armed groups, including some linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS), as well as local rebels.Following military coups in all three countries in recent years, the new ruling authorities have expelled French forces and turned to Russia’s mercenary units for security assistance, which is seen as having made little difference.","headline":"Mali shuts schools as fuel blockade imposed by fighters paralyses country","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/mali-shuts-schools-as-fuel-blockade-imposed-by-fighters-paralyses-country","message":"Military government orders two-week closure for schools and universities as blockade on fuel imports declared by JNIM causes further disruptions.

The news sent Asian stocks soaring to record peaks.\"I've got a lot of respect for President Xi and I think we're going to come away with a deal,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One before landing in the Japanese capital Tokyo.Wearing a gold tie and blue suit, Trump gave a few fist pumps before his helicopter whisked him off for a scenic night tour of Tokyo, several of its towers lit up in the red, white and blue of the American flag.He later headed in a long motorcade to the Imperial Palace, where he shook hands and posed for photographs with Japanese Emperor Naruhito.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Japanese counterpart Ryosei Akazawa, architects of the tariff deal agreed in July, discussed power grids as being a potential investment area over a sushi lunch in Tokyo earlier on Monday, local media reported.Japan's newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is hoping to further impress Trump on Tuesday with promises to purchase U.S. pickup trucks, soybeans and gas, and announce an agreement on shipbuilding, sources with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.Takaichi, who became Japan's first female premier last week, told Trump that strengthening their countries' alliance was her \"top priority\" in a telephone call on Saturday.Trump said he was looking forward to meeting Takaichi, a close ally of his late friend and golfing partner, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, adding: \"I think she's going to be great.\"Thousands of police are guarding Tokyo. A knife-wielding man was arrested on Friday outside the U.S. embassy and an anti-Trump protest is planned in downtown Shinjuku.Naruhito's role, however, is purely symbolic, and the key diplomacy will take place with Takaichi on Tuesday.Trump and Takaichi are set to meet at the nearby Akasaka Palace, where he met Abe six years ago, and will be welcomed by a military honour guard. Among the investment pledges, the two countries will sign a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday on investment in shipbuilding, a source with knowledge of the plans said.Takaichi is also expected to reassure Trump that Tokyo is willing to do more on security after telling lawmakers on Friday she plans to accelerate Japan's biggest defence build-up since World War Two.Japan hosts the largest concentration of U.S. military power abroad. Trump has said previously Tokyo is not spending enough to defend its islands from an increasingly assertive China.Trump is due to leave on Wednesday for Gyeongju in South Korea, where he will hold talks with President Lee Jae Myung. Bessent told reporters the overall framework of a deal with South Korea was also done but would not be finalised this week.Thursday's expected meeting with Xi will come after Washington and Beijing have raised tariffs on each other's exports and threatened to halt trade involving critical minerals and technologies.Neither side expects a breakthrough that would restore the terms of trade that existed before Trump's return to power.Talks to prepare for the meeting have focused on managing disagreements and modest improvements, before a visit by Trump to China expected early next year.","headline":"Trump gets royal welcome in Japan, China trade truce hopes rise","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-heads-tokyo-trade-security-talks-before-xi-summit-2025-10-27/","message":"Trump, making his longest journey abroad since taking office in January, announced a flurry of deals on trade and critical minerals with four Southeast Asian nations during the first stop in Malaysia and is set to meet Xi in South Korea on Thursday.

On Tuesday, he will meet Japan’s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi.• In Malaysia, US-China trade negotiators reported major progress on a potential trade deal, easing tensions before Trump’s expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week. Trump said he is open to extending his trip to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though there are no known scheduled plans for talks.• Back in the US, senators will return to Washington with no end to the federal government shutdown in sight. And some lawmakers are expressing alarm about Trump’s expanding military campaign in the Caribbean.Looking ahead to Tuesday: Trump is set to meet Japan’s new, conservative prime minister in the morning local time. In the afternoon, he’ll visit with US troops aboard the USS George Washington and give a speech. He’ll dine with business leaders in the evening.While you were sleeping: The president spoke to reporters on the way to Tokyo. Here are the highlights:President Donald Trump visited with Emperor Naruhito of Japan on Monday for what the White House described as a courtesy visit, kicking off a series of warm welcomes in Tokyo.The visit offered rare access to the emperor’s residence, a simple building made of vast concrete with large windows overlooking a foyer with meticulously-pruned bonsai trees.The emperor smiled and offered a wave to the US president. Trump, dressed in a navy suit and gold tie, emerged, excitedly gestured and warmly greeted the emperor. They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. The two then turned to the cameras and smiled for a photo, Trump fiddling with his suit jacket button briefly. Then they turned to walk inside the residence. Trump briefly put his hand on the emperor as they walked inside.The two leaders emerged after more than half an hour inside, with Trump calling the emperor “a great man.”President Donald Trump said he is open to extending his Asia trip to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though there are no known scheduled plans for talks.Trump administration officials have privately discussed setting up a meeting between the leaders, though many are skeptical that it will happen, sources told CNN before the trip.In Trump’s first term, officials arranged a handshake between the two men in the Korean demilitarized zone less than 48 hours after the president tweeted an invitation to get together — an example of how quickly things can change.President Donald Trump says he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip to Asia. But is that logistically possible? CNN's Will Ripley explains why he's feeling a bit of deja vu.President Donald Trump has arrived in Tokyo, Japan, his second stop on a three-country tour of Asia.After the president walked off Air Force One on arrival in Tokyo, he shook hands with a number of US and Japanese officials waiting on the ground – including Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, the US ambassador to Japan, and the commander of US forces in Japan.Here in Tokyo, he’ll also meet with Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative and protege of the late Shinzo Abe, who became Japan’s first female prime minister this month.China sent a group of H-6K strategic bombers near Taiwan for “confrontation drills,” Chinese state media reported late Sunday, just days ahead of an expected meeting between US President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping.Without specifying a date, the Chinese state television’s military channel reported that air force units of the Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command – responsible for operations around Taiwan – conducted combat training that focused on reconnaissance, early warnings, air blockades and precision strikes in key areas.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry publicizes daily updates on Chinese military activities around the island’s waters and airspace. On Monday morning, the ministry said four sorties of Chinese aircraft were detected, without specifying any abnormalities.The ministry said in a statement that the Chinese report was “clearly a public-opinion operation aimed at intimidation.”Some context: China regularly sends its fighter jets, drones and warships to airspace and waters around Taiwan, and in recent years has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on the self-ruled island democracy, which Beijing claims as its own – despite having never ruled over it.The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, and is bound by law to sell arms to the island for its self-defense, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion.President Donald Trump said Monday he was “very much opposed” to his administration’s handling of a September immigration raid at a Hyundai plant, offering an olive branch ahead of his trip to South Korea later this week.“You know how I feel, I was very much opposed. Look, when they come in, they’re making very complex machinery, equipment, things. They’re going to have to bring some people in, at least at that initial phase,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during his trip to Asia.“They’ve got to bring people in with them for a period of time. They’ll teach our people how to do it, but even for a fairly long period of time, they’re going to need expertise to be successful,” he said.Pressed on whether he was opposed to the raid, Trump said he “was opposed to getting them out. And in fact, before they got out, they were pretty well set… I said they could stay… and they’re going to be coming back.”After the raid, President Lee Jae Myung openly expressed concern about the future of South Korean investment in the US, saying that confusion over the visa situation would lead local companies to question “whether they should go at all.”President Donald Trump told reporters that he received an MRI scan during a recent trip to Walter Reed, the first time he has provided details of the tests in his second medical exam this year and raising new questions about the president’s health.He added: “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI, and the machine, you know, the whole thing, and it was perfect.”Trump, who at 79 is one of the oldest presidents in US history, declined to say why he received the MRI during the Walter Reed visit earlier this month, telling reporters to “ask the doctors.”The president claimed that his doctors offered reporters a “very conclusive” report of the exam, but the White House has not previously disclosed the reason for his unusual second visit, a departure from the traditional presidential cadence of a single comprehensive exam per year.“I think they gave you a very conclusive – nobody has ever given you reports like I gave you. And if I didn’t think it was going to be good, either, I would let you know negatively, I wouldn’t run. I’d do something. But the doctor said some of the best reports for the age, some of the best reports they’ve ever seen,” he said.This summer, the White House announced that Trump was examined for swelling in his legs and has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. Trump has also faced scrutiny over regular bruising on his right hand that he’s appeared at times to cover up with heavy makeup. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has attributed it to a combination of “frequent handshaking” and aspirin use, which can increase bruising.US President Trump said he would “love to see” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his Asia trip, though there are no known scheduled plans for a meeting.“I haven’t mentioned it, I haven’t said anything, but I’d love to meet with him if he’d like to meet,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. “I got along great with Kim Jong Un, I liked him, he liked me, if he wants to meet, I’ll be in South Korea.”Trump will be visiting South Korea later this week, where he will join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO summit.When asked if he would consider extending his trip to facilitate a possible meeting with Kim, Trump suggested he was open the that.“I hadn’t thought of it, but I think the answer would be yeah, I would, I would do that, sure. It’s our last stop, so it’s pretty easy to do.”But the talks ended without any breakthrough, and efforts at denuclearization or peace negotiations fizzled out afterward.President Donald Trump has declined to say when his newly threatened tariff on Canada would go into effect, as he continues to vent his frustration with the United States’ northern neighbor.“We’re going to let them know,” Trump told reporters when asked when the tariffs would be implemented, describing Canada as “difficult.”Trump was pressed by a reporter on the ad, which was purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, and claimed that the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, was aware of it.“Whether it’s provincial or Canada itself, they all knew exactly what the ad was. The prime minister knew. Everybody knew,” Trump said aboard Air Force One, en route to Japan — the next stop on his Asia tour.US President Trump waved off reports of Russia testing a nuclear-powered missile, saying on Monday that the US also had nuclear submarines located close to Russia.“They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shore,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One, speaking during his trip to Asia.“And I don’t think it’s an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way,” Trump added.“He ought to get the war ended, a war that should have taken one week is now in its fourth year, that’s what he ought to do instead of testing missiles.”Putin’s announcement on the new missile test came as Russia launched its second deadly attack on Ukraine in two nights. It also came the same week that a potential summit with Trump broke down, and the White House placed sanctions on two of Russia’s largest oil companies – some of the Trump administration’s most tangible actions against Russia to date.We’re tracking President Donald Trump’s diplomatic tour in Asia, as he firms up a string of agreements in the region.Trump has left Malaysia and is now on his way to Japan, where he will meet the country’s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, on Tuesday.In the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, Trump joined the signing of a peace declaration between Thailand and Cambodia. Trump has repeatedly called it a peace “treaty,” though the document called it a joint declaration and Thai diplomats were more measured in their description.Cambodia and Malaysia each signed reciprocal trade agreements with the US that include access to critical minerals.Trump also met with Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva while in Kuala Lumpur, signaling an ease in relations following a major rift this year. Lula said he was “convinced” his country would soon strike a trade deal with the US, with both sides saying they had a very good meeting.Across town, US trade negotiators reached the framework of a trade deal with China. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that an escalation in tariffs on China is “effectively off the table” following what he described as “very good” trade talks. Chinese negotiators echoed that characterization, saying the sides had reached a “basic consensus.”Bessent also said soybean farmers are going to be “extremely happy” with the terms of the deal, and that he, too, had been burdened by trade tensions with China as the owner of soybean and corn farms.The progress set the table for Trump’s expected high-stakes meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week.Beyond trade talk, Trump is expected to urge Xi to join the US pressure campaign against Russia. “China needs to join the US and our other allies in raising their voice and saying that this senseless (Ukraine) war needs to end,” US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said Sunday. Last week, the Trump administration unexpectedly announced “massive sanctions” on Russia’s two biggest oil producers.US President Donald Trump is en route to Japan to meet Emperor Naruhito and sit down with the country’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, for the first time on Tuesday.Though the US-Japan alliance is one of the world’s strongest, Takaichi’s limited diplomatic experience and Trump’s unpredictability make their first meeting a critical test.Their talks are expected to cover tariffs, regional security and Japan’s defense spending, all points of tension in recent months. Within Japan’s conservative ruling party, some worry Washington’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific is fading, as it demands more from allies.As negotiators from Washington and Beijing work toward securing a deal between the top global economies, we’re taking a step back and looking at some key components of the potential trade pact.• Rare earths: The framework could also delay export curbs on rare-earth minerals, which threaten to reduce US access to the materials used in military equipment, smartphones, televisions and batteries used in electric vehicles.Negotiators from the US and China have signaled progress on trade talks between the global powers, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touting the “substantial framework” of a deal to avoid escalating tariffs.But US officials have indicated the future of a potential trade deal will ultimately hinge on this week’s meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.• Trump and Xi met face-to-face five times during the US president’s first term, including a Mar-a-Lago welcome for Xi and a Trump trip to Beijing.• Trump has long heralded Xi’s leadership and touted a warm relationship with his counterpart, whom he’s described both as a “friend” and “extremely hard to make a deal with.”• Beijing is seeking some predictability from Trump, who notoriously conducts a capricious brand of diplomacy.• Trump threatened to call off this week’s meeting earlier this month, as a period of relative calm was shattered by new trade tensions over rare earths, tech exports and tariffs. But the US president voiced optimism before leaving on his trip, indicating last Wednesday that he’s heading into talks in dealmaking mode.","headline":"In Malaysia, US negotiators reached trade deal ‘framework’ with China, easing tensions before Trump’s meeting with Xi this week","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-asia-trip-japan-10-27-25","message":"• President Donald Trump is in Japan, the next stop on his Asia diplomacy tour, where he visited Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo’s Imperial Palace.

His union, IF Metall, provides accommodation in the form of a mobile builders' van, as well as coffee and sandwiches.The strike concerns an issue that goes to the heart of Swedish industrial culture - the right of trade unions to negotiate pay and conditions on behalf of their members. This concept of collective agreement has underpinned industrial relations in Sweden for nearly a century.It's an arrangement welcomed across the board. \"We prefer the right to negotiate freely with the unions and sign collective agreements,\" says Mattias Dahl of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise business organisation.\"But they wouldn't respond,\" says Marie Nilsson, the union's president.  \"And we got the impression that they tried to hide away or not discuss this with us.\"He recalls a performance review at which he says he was refused an annual pay rise because he was \"not reaching Tesla's goals\". Meanwhile, a colleague was said to have been turned down for a pay rise because he had the \"wrong attitude\".\"Tesla has done it [found replacement staff] openly and systematically,\" says German Bender, a researcher at Arena Idé, a think tank financed by Swedish trade unions.\"It's not illegal, which is important to understand. But it goes against all established norms. But Tesla doesn't care about norms.\"They want to be norm breakers. So if somebody tells them, hey, you are breaking a norm, they see that as a compliment.\"The BBC asked to speak to Tesla's subsidiary, TM Sweden, but the request was declined in an email citing \"all-time high deliveries\".Mr Stark denied that the decision not to enter a collective agreement was one made at Tesla headquarter in the US. \"We have a mandate to make our own such decisions,\" he said.IF Metall is not entirely alone in its fight. The strike has been supported by a number of other unions.Dockworkers in neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland, are refusing to handle Teslas; rubbish is no longer collected from Tesla's Swedish facilities; and newly built charging stations are not being connected to the grid in the country.With stakes high on both sides, it's hard to see an end to the stand-off. IF Metall risks setting a precedent if it concedes the principle of collective agreement.\"The concern is that that would spread,\" says Mr Bender, \"and eventually erode the strong support for the labour market model that we have among employers as well\".Tesla, on the other hand, may feel that conceding this fight in Sweden would strengthen the hand of those who want to unionise Tesla at its production facilities in the US and Germany, where it employs tens of thousands of staff.Mr Bender detects another reason for the position Tesla has taken. \"I think it's important to understand that Elon Musk doesn't want to be sort of told how to do things,\" he says.\"And I think he doesn't view the industrial action that the union has taken as an invitation to negotiate, but rather as an ultimatum to sign a dotted line that he doesn't want to sign.\"Mr Blomhäll of Tesla Club Sweden also says he sees no quick solution. \"This will be another Korean War,\" he says. \"A conflict that just drags on.\"Earlier this month unions rejected a renewed pay offer saying they will ballot for industrial action.Union leaders met on Thursday to discuss what had been tabled by health officials, with some describing the settlement as \"unacceptable\".","headline":"The striking Swedish workers taking on carmaker Tesla","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9082q0jjo","message":"Janis spends each Monday with a colleague, standing outside a Tesla garage on an industrial park in Malmö.

But after years of murky operations and central bank interventions, Ayandeh had racked up losses on a scale that impacted Iran’s macroeconomics, so its bailout will not leave Iranians unscathed.That was when hundreds of unlicensed financial institutions linked with parastatal, military, or religious foundations mushroomed across the country.They offered exorbitant interest rates to attract cash away from the banks, and did not repay the deposits in many instances, leaving thousands of investors unable to withdraw their deposits for years.The institutions had little in their coffers after being taken over due to loans to insiders and money sunk into property.Much of the skyrocketing debt accrued by the institutions had to be recuperated by printing money, which meant rising inflation and increased costs of living for average Iranians.Ansari has been behind gigantic real estate projects, owns ventures in steel, telecommunications and hospitality, and sat on the board of Tehran’s Esteghlal football club, among other business and influence-growing activities.But that did not help, and the bank kept borrowing from the central bank and the government to stay afloat.Iranians online have also been widely reacting to news of Ayandeh’s bankruptcy. Private sector businessman Pedram Soltani was among those who called for accountability.لیست وامها و تسهیلات معوق و مشکوک‌الوصول و داراییهای سمی #بانک_آینده را منتشر کنید!مردم باید بدانند هزینه چه کسانی بر جیبشان تحمیل شده است.Translation: Publish the list of overdue and doubtful-to-return loans and toxic assets of Ayandeh Bank!  People must know whose costs have been imposed on their pockets.Most of the loans paid by Ayandeh have been overdue for a year or longer and are considered unlikely to be recovered.Bijan Khajehpour, an economist and a managing partner at Eurasian Nexus Partners consulting firm, pointed out that all Iranian banks have a large volume of non-performing loans (NPL) in their books.“These NPLs are a consequence of loans having been extended to customers without the due process of assessing their collateral based on corrupt transactions between networks of power,” he told Al Jazeera.“It says a lot about the extent of corruption and how political patronage undermines business activities.”Ayandeh is not an isolated case; it simply underscores the systemic woes of Iran’s globally isolated financial sector.The announcement on Ayandeh’s dissolution came one day after Iran’s judiciary chief, ultraconservative cleric Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, directly threatened Central Bank of Iran Governor Mohammad-Reza Farzin with legal action.“Mr Farzin, you have sufficient legal mandate to make any decision about Ayandeh Bank. Do your legal duty or else we will come in and increase costs for you,” he wrote in a post on X.Ejei said that despite the central bank’s involvement in running Ayandeh for seven years – appointing and dismissing the board of directors and the CEO – the bank’s accumulated losses increased by up to tenfold in that time.No arrests or indictments, or any other form of legal reproach, have been announced by the judiciary despite the billions of dollars in losses.Along with the judiciary, hardline politicians with the Paydari Front – who have been entrenching power in the parliament, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and state media – have consistently been the most vocal critics of the private bank.In addition to scoring points for appearing to be anti-corruption, the hardliners opposed the bank to discredit political and economic rivals in the technocratic camp affiliated with reformists who are in favour of liberalising the Iranian economy and opening it up to the West.Parliament speaker and former IRGC commander Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf hailed Ayandeh’s dissolution as “a great success for the country’s decision-making and governance system” in a statement on Saturday.Ayandeh’s downfall also puts its assets, many of them in the real estate sector, under full state control, but they will be difficult and time-consuming to sell.The central bank has emphasised that somehow, all of the assets but “none of the imbalances” of Ayandeh will be transferred to Bank Melli and to compensate for some of the losses, Ayandeh’s assets will be managed and sold, wherever possible, by Melli.The crown jewel of the assets is Iran Mall, the largest mall in the world in terms of total constructed floor area, located in western Tehran.The Deposit Guarantee Fund, which insures bank deposits up to a ceiling under the central bank’s auspices, will have to foot a fraction of the bill as well.The central bank says Ayandeh’s top shareholders will have to account for some of the money, but it remains unclear how much, by what time and exactly in what form they will have to pay.However, due to the large volume of accumulated losses, Iranian media estimate that in an optimistic scenario, the state and Bank Melli will have to account for about two-thirds of the debt.In simple terms, tens of millions of Iranians will pay the price over the coming months and years in the form of decreased purchasing power.For his part, Ayandeh’s Ansari said in a statement on Friday that the bankruptcy came “as a result of decisions and policies that were made outside the bank’s control”, adding that the bank has left behind “valuable legacies and lasting assets”.Ansari added “my conscience is at ease and my heart is assured”, and said he had devoted all his strength to service and to the public good.","headline":"Corruption, mismanagement in spotlight as Iran dissolves major private bank","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/corruption-mismanagement-in-spotlight-as-iran-dissolves-major-private-bank","message":"The bank built the largest mall in the world, but also racked up massive debt and gave loans to insiders.

this time in colour - creates a striking juxtaposition.Taken on Saturday, it shows shoppers thronging to similar stalls in a northern suburb of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, while a column of black smoke rises ominously in the background.The night before, as the city's sleep was interrupted once again by the now all-too-familiar booms of missile and drone strikes, two people were killed and nine others injured.When I visited the market - with the black fumes still billowing from the missile strike on a nearby warehouse - that sense of fortitude was evident.A shopper who told me she had felt her house tremble from the force of the blast was still visibly shaken by the experience.Inspiring memes about blitz-spirit are all very well, but for Ukraine the far bigger question is not how to endure this war, but how to stop it.And with President Donald Trump proclaiming his powers as a peacemaker and pushing that question back to the centre of global politics, another term from that same period in history is once again looming large – 'appeasement'.But more than three years after it launched its full-scale invasion, the war is entering a new phase, and that word has re-entered the global debate.On the battlefield, fighting has reached a brutal stalemate, and Russia is now increasingly targeting Ukrainian cities far from the front line.Its aerial attacks – using ballistic missiles, explosive-laden drones and glide bombs – have gone from an average of a few dozen each day last year to nightly, and often run into the many hundreds.What the Kremlin insists are \"military and quasi-military\" targets now regularly include Ukraine's civilian rail stations, passenger trains, gas and electricity supplies, and homes and businesses.As well as the human toll, the financial burden is rising exponentially, with the cost of the air defence systems significantly higher than that of the waves of cheap drones being sent to overwhelm them.Just over a week ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky set off for his meeting in Washington with President Donald Trump in optimistic mood.But he was wrong-footed by a surprise Trump-Putin phone call while en route, and subsequent talk of another summit between the two leaders in Budapest.Zelensky's own exchange with Trump in the White House was reportedly a difficult one, with the US president once again repeating his old talking points.Framing the conflict as little more than a fight between two men who didn't like each other, Trump insisted they needed to settle the war along the existing front line.Warning of the risks of escalation, he also refused to grant Ukraine the use of the long-range Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia.Gregory Meeks, a senior Democrat on the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, called Trump's strategy \"weakness through appeasement\".Meanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X that \"appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace\".Although the comments from the Ukrainian president were slightly more guarded – having learned the hard way not to criticise Trump too strongly – they implied the same meaning.\"Ukraine will never grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes, and we count on our partners to take the same position,\" Zelensky wrote on social media after arriving back in Kyiv.With Russia making it clear that it wasn't anything like as ready as the US president had hoped to end the fighting - vowing instead to advance on even more territory - the planned summit was put on ice.Washington promptly sanctioned Russia's two biggest oil companies – a sign, perhaps, of growing impatience with Putin.While the economic impact to Russia is likely to be minimal, it represents a major shift in Trump's foreign policy, having previously said he would not impose sanctions until European nations ceased buying Russian oil.Even if that is the case, it's clear that a large gulf remains between the US and European view of how to end the conflict.It was on firmer ground that Zelensky found himself a few days later, meeting various European leaders in Brussels and later in London.More sanctions packages were agreed and progress was made towards using Russia's own frozen assets to fund Ukraine's war aims, though ultimately no final agreement was struck.Speaking alongside Zelensky in Downing Street on Friday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised he would work with his European partners to help provide more long-range weapons to take the fight onto Russian territory.\"You could always appease lions by throwing Christians to them,\" Harold Macmillan, a future prime minister and opponent of the policy, once said.And yet we sometimes forget that the man most associated with the policy, then-prime minister Neville Chamberlain, enjoyed significant support from the US, which shared his deep fear of repeating the horrors of the World War One.The risk of a widening war with a nuclear armed state is not to be taken lightly, as Ukraine increases the effectiveness and frequency of its strikes on Russian oil depots and, in some instances, its power grid.The Russian leader knows this, warning recently that the use of foreign supplied Tomahawks could prompt a response that was \"serious, if not staggering.\"\"Russia only stops when it's washed in its own blood,\" said Yevhen Mahda, a professor at Kyiv's National Aviation University.At the market, surrounded by gourds and carrots grown in his own garden, Fedir said he had also been jolted awake by the power of the nearby missile strike.\"Putin understands only force,\" he said. \"We need to destroy their airfields and their factories that produce these shells, bombs and missiles.\"The greater risk, he suggested, lies in concessions, negotiations or appeasement – call it what you will – that, however well motivated, only serve to further embolden an authoritarian power.\"Does Europe think he will calm down after Ukraine,\" he asked. \"If he takes Ukraine, he'll carry on.\"The experimental weapon is hailed as having a potentially unlimited range  - though Western experts have questioned its value.A \"coalition of the willing\" meeting in London seeks to increase pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine.","headline":"In Russia's 'blitz' of Ukraine, the question of appeasement is back","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew40lqvel2o","message":"Following another week of intensive and lethal Russian bombardment of Ukraine's cities, a composite image has been doing the rounds on Ukrainian social media.

Beijing said they had \"constructive\" discussions.Bessent said the countries had \"reached a substantial framework for the two leaders\", adding: \"The tariffs will be averted.\"The Chinese government said in a statement that both negotiating teams \"reached a basic consensus on arrangements to address their respective concerns\".Since Trump re-entered the White House, he has imposed and threatened sweeping tariffs on imports from overseas on various countries, arguing that the policy would help boost US manufacturing and jobs. The introduction of tariffs has resulted in many countries, including the UK, agreeing new deals with the US.But the steepest levies he has threatened have been levelled at China. Beijing has hit back with measures of its own, though the two agreed to hold off implementing the levies while pursuing a trade deal.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials.China will \"delay that for a year while they re-examine it\", Bessent told a different news show, This Week, on Sunday.Another issue of contention is soybeans, of which China is the world's biggest buyer. As the trade war began heating up, China halted all orders, hurting US farmers.\"I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain too... I think we have addressed the farmers' concerns,\" he said on This Week.\"I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public that our soybean farmers will feel really good about what's going on for this season and the coming seasons for several years.\"Bessent also said a deal had been agreed on video-sharing platform TikTok's US arm, with Trump and Xi left to \"consummate that transaction on Thursday\".The US has sought to prise the app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security concerns.TikTok was previously told it had to sell its US operations or risk being shut down, but Trump has delayed implementing the ban four times to facilitate negotiations, and has extended the deadline again to December.The White House announced last month that US companies would control TikTok's algorithm and Americans would hold six of seven board seats for the app's US operations.On Sunday, Washington also announced a slew of trade deals with Malaysia and Cambodia and framework agreements with Thailand and Vietnam.The region, which is heavily dependent on trade with the US, is among the hardest hit by Trump's tariffs.Trump signed agreements involving the trade of critical minerals with Thailand and Malaysia. These expand the US' access to rare earth elements and other metals beyond China.Trump also announced framework agreements for the US to trade more goods with Cambodia and Thailand.The White House and Vietnam announced \"unprecedented\" trade access between the countries. Vietnam also agreed to buying Boeing jets worth more than $8bn (£6bn) from the US and American agricultural goods.","headline":"US and China agree framework of trade deal ahead of Trump-Xi meeting","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lqj5lz4geo","message":"The US and China have agreed the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when their respective leaders meet later this week, the US treasury secretary has said.

Justice Minister Joseph Geng Akech has publicly warned that commenting on the ongoing trial of Machar and his co-accused could amount to contempt of court.“The stakes of this trial are existentially high for South Sudan,” said Daniel Akech, a South Sudan expert with the International Crisis Group. “If the process is not managed with extreme political care, the fallout could shatter the country’s fragile cohesion and trigger a collapse of the state.”Through decades of armed rebellion and reconciliation, Machar has become both a political institution and one of South Sudan’s most divisive figures.The agreement – named the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, or R-ARCSS – set out benchmarks intended to shepherd the country to national elections.In the post-war years, as politicians in Juba lost legitimacy amid persistent insecurity, economic crisis, and virtually nonexistent service provision, Machar maintained what support he had left from his base by casting himself as a democratiser and bulwark against Dinka nationalism, analysts and opposition supporters say.Although Machar’s popularity had waned in recent years, owing to what some see as his abandoning of the grassroots to pursue personal political goals, he is still widely viewed as the figurehead of South Sudan’s Nuer population and the only opposition leader with sufficient political heft to implement the peace agreement. His prosecution, some analysts say, has buoyed his support once again.“To some extent, Machar’s arrest has renewed his legitimacy,” said Joshua Craze, an independent researcher on South Sudan. “I say to some extent because many people might not be willing to fight over the fact that he’s been detained. But if something bad were to happen to him, that could be a spark for more widespread fighting.”Analysts have long criticised the peace deal for sidelining grassroots institutions and consolidating power within a small class of armed elites. Its defenders maintain that it has mitigated conflict between the main signatories and remains the best route to stability, though key provisions, such as the integration of forces into a national army, have gone unimplemented.During early sessions, Machar’s defence argued that the trial was unlawful under conditions in the peace agreement and should be stopped. The attack on the garrison, they said, was a ceasefire violation that should be investigated by a neutral monitoring body overseen by an East African bloc, as stipulated in the accord.The government has argued that the special court has jurisdiction over the alleged crimes under domestic law. It says it plans to present forensic and financial evidence and call more than two dozen witnesses to show how the defendants incited and aided the attack.But several lawyers, civil society members, and trial observers who spoke to Al Jazeera believe that by trying Machar in a South Sudanese court, President Kiir is abrogating the agreement.“It is not just the defendants that are on trial, but the entire peace agreement,” said a lawyer working on Machar’s defence team, who spoke on condition of anonymity.“Charging Machar while he still occupies his constitutionally recognised office of first vice president violates the agreement’s core equilibrium, that neither side could unilaterally dominate the other during the transition,” said Remember Miamingi, a South Sudanese legal scholar and former adviser to the African Union’s political affairs, peace, and security department.He added that the effect of the government’s unilateral action could also deter opposition groups from participating in future peace talks. “If former insurgents know that participation in government exposes them to prosecution by institutions controlled by their rivals, they will rationally choose continued insurgency over integration,” he said.Analysts say it’s unclear whether a guilty verdict would translate immediately to an uptick in fighting. A large number of the opposition forces loyal to Machar, weakened in recent years, are already fighting on multiple fronts and may not have many more forces or materiel to commit. Yet such a verdict could still drive greater antigovernment sentiment, spur opportunistic pacts and push aggrieved community militias into the opposition fold.This month, a prominent member of the ruling SPLM, Nhial Deng Nhial, defected to form his own party, the South Sudan Salvation Movement, saying the party had “betrayed its founding ideals”. His departure may presage a fracturing of the SPLM itself.Government officials have framed Machar’s trial as the beginning of a new chapter in South Sudan’s history, one in which no individual is above the law.“This case sends a clear message,” Akech, the justice minister, said at a recent news briefing. “Those who commit atrocities against the people of South Sudan, our armed forces, or humanitarian workers will be held accountable, regardless of their position or political influence.”To many South Sudanese, that claim rings hollow, given that much of the country’s political class has been implicated in the theft of billions of dollars in public funds, along with a litany of human rights abuses committed by all sides, as documented by UN commissions and advocacy groups.“There is a deep hypocrisy in the trial of Machar while other officials, including the president, have never faced justice,” said civil society leader Yakani.“If a hybrid court is established, it will not be the [first] vice president alone who will go there,” said Simon, one of the court observers. “It will be the whole leadership.”Miamingi, the former AU adviser, called the trial “weaponised justice” and warned that it could become a motor for future ethnic strife. “The trial of Riek Machar, a Nuer leader, in the absence of equivalent accountability for Dinka political and military figures, risks being interpreted not as impartial justice but as ethnic reprisal through law,” he said. “The result is not accountability but renewed confrontation under a legal guise.”Many see the trial as an act of political score-settling that also advances the succession plan of President Kiir, 74, whose health is rumoured to be in decline.In September, the president promoted Bol Mel to the rank of general in the national intelligence service, his third promotion in less than a year.His rise has also divided the party itself. Analysts say he is widely viewed, even in the president’s camp, of being an undeserving upstart with no military background, sidelining veterans of the independence struggle who see themselves as the party’s rightful heirs. Several high-ranking officials were notably absent from his swearing-in as party deputy, local media outlet Radio Tamazuj reported.“The fear of a Bol Mel presidency is a major political force, extending far beyond one community,” said Akech, the South Sudan expert. “A majority of Dinka elites, in particular, would rather not see Machar defeated if it means Bol Mel becomes president.”Bol Mel may not ultimately assume the presidency, given Kiir’s record of building up and then abruptly sacking close allies. Yet any course of succession runs the risk of fracturing the SPLM and triggering more widespread fighting, including in the capital.“There are two political institutions in South Sudan, the president and Riek Machar,” said Wani Michael, a South Sudanese lawyer specialising in constitutional law. “And getting rid of either of them will not be easy. It will have consequences.”","headline":"Why VP Machar’s trial presents ‘existentially high’ stakes for South Sudan","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/27/why-riek-machars-trial-brings-existentially-high-stakes-for-south-sudan","message":"Some see the first vice president’s trial as a provocation that has set the country on a path to war.

Two, three or four in a row does, so I think the last few months I've been good.\"It was also a timely reminder that, with four races now remaining as the season approaches its climax, McLaren have been the team of the year, not Red Bull.The talk coming into the weekend was all about the threat Max Verstappen posed after three victories and a second place in the past four races had seen the Dutchman cut Piastri's lead by 64 points.It did not take a maths genius to work out that if Verstappen kept that up, he would win his fifth consecutive world title at the end of the season.But, after a few races in which they felt they had underperformed as a team, Norris delivered a statement win for McLaren - and himself.He went on to take pole with one of the stand-out laps of the season. He brushed off the threat of the slipstream from those behind on the long run to the first corner and dodged the mayhem that unfolded behind.The only time he lost the lead was as a result of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc cutting the third corner in the midst of his battle with team-mate Lewis Hamilton just behind Norris.Once Leclerc had made amends for passing Norris illegally by letting the McLaren back past on the run to Turn Four, Norris disappeared into the distance.\"In a way, I think it's just my best performance through a whole weekend,\" added Norris. \"You know, all my laps in qualifying, all my practice, all my race.\"Norris has been through the mill this year. He started his campaign with a win in Australia, but Piastri then took control of the season and had won four races before Norris took a second.Norris could not get on with the car, which was not giving him the feelings he needed to be quick. But, following a tweak to the front suspension for the Canadian Grand Prix in June, he has slowly been working his way back into it.His win this weekend was his fourth since then. In that time, Piastri has taken only two - the last one in Zandvoort when Norris retired.At the time, that looked like a body blow to Norris' hopes. Piastri had been so convincing, so solid, that making up that sort of margin looked impossible.Norris said: \"You put that behind you, right? You forget about that as much as you can, and you just focus on every race coming up.\"Every weekend's new and you have a fresh start to try new things and try to do better than before. And I feel like that's what I've done very well this weekend.\"As Norris has found his form, Piastri started to go off the boil a little straight after Zandvoort. Norris was quicker in Italy. Piastri had a nightmare weekend in Baku, crashing three times and jumping the start.There was a bit of controversy at the start in Singapore, when Norris barged past into third place. But Piastri has been simply slow over the past two races in the US and Mexico.\"The last few have been decent,\" said Norris. \"But still a long way to go, so I just have to keep doing what I'm doing, keep trying to be consistent against some very quick guys around me. And, yeah, I think that'll be good.\"But it doesn't mean because I'm ahead or behind or whatever that I have to drive or do anything differently.\"Norris admitted after the race in Mexico that there had been times earlier this year when he \"certainly did\" doubt himself.\"When the car was winning, and Oscar was winning, the last thing I could do was use the excuse that my car wasn't good enough,\" he said.\"I wasn't getting to grips and finding a way to make it work and I'm finding a better way to make it work now, so it's as simple as that.\"It is now Piastri facing that feeling, after two difficult weekends during which he has been a fair way off the pace.\"For some reason, the last couple of weekends have required a very different way of driving,\" said Piastri.The race was about trying to apply them - even if he was not able to get a definitive answer as to whether they had worked, given he spent most of it stuck behind other cars on his way to a fifth place that will have felt painful, but in reality amounted to a solid recovery and exercise in damage limitation.\"Ultimately today was about trying to experiment with some of those things,\" said Piastri. \"Because driving the way I've had to drive these last couple of weekends is not particularly natural for me.\"He said that Norris excels in low-grip conditions, whereas Piastri's driving style tends more towards high-grip levels, and he pointed out that, in only his third season, Piastri still has things to learn about adapting to different conditions.\"In the final four races, no reason to think that one may favour one driver or the other,\" said Stella, pointing to Las Vegas as the most problematic potentially for the team.\"For Lando and Oscar, there's no problem in terms of track layout coming in the next four races. If anything, we need to make sure that from a McLaren point of view, we are in condition to extract the full performance that is available in the car, like we have been able to do here in Mexico.\"The confidence in terms of the championship is increased. It's increased because we have proven that we have a car that can win races and in some conditions can dominate races.\"This is the most important factor to put Lando and Oscar in condition to pursue the drivers' championship.\"As for Verstappen, so buoyant after his win in Austin, he was feeling a lot more subdued after a messy first part of the race before fighting back to finish third behind Norris and Leclerc.\"It's going to be tough, but let's see what we can do in other tracks. I hope, of course, we won't experience a weekend like this again, but it still shows that we're not quick in every scenario.

Trade wars, hot wars, polarized blocs, national security priorities, industrial policies and investment curbs are all daily considerations for investors in the biggest economies, never mind the traditionally more volatile emerging ones.One major question during the tariff disputes this spring was whether America's exceptional outperformance as the home of choice for cross-border investment was tarnished. The concern was foreign investors loaded up with expensive U.S. assets may cut and run and diversify elsewhere.Those worries appear to have been premature to date, even if widescale hedging of dollar currency exposure did ensue.But the issue extends beyond U.S. exceptionalism. The real question is whether an extreme \"home bias\" re-emerges on the back of rising trade barriers, increased capital curbs and stretched valuations. At the same time, governments are creating a wave of incentives to keep investment savings at home, often to fund national priorities like defense, tech or budgetary reasons.In other words, if \"America First\" sets the agenda of the world's biggest economy, should we also now brace for China First, Europe First and even Japan First or Britain First?As Trump uses tariff barriers to try to cut the huge U.S. trade deficit, his re-industrialization agenda and push to retain U.S. tech dominance is involving not only extraordinary industrial policies to tempt or pressure investment back home but even government stakes in key firms and industries.Seeing the writing on the wall, China has doubled down on developing its own tech ecosystem and domestic demand. Led by Germany, Europe's defense, infrastructure and capital markets push is underway. Japan, the UK and Canada are floating similar priorities.Trying to capture what a prolonged wave of global capital repatriation might mean for financial markets - and currency markets in particular - Deutsche Bank last week tried to model the impact of a massive repatriation of overseas money.\"The theme of 'homecoming' will be a structural one for markets in the quarters and years to come,\" concluded Mallika Sachdeva at the Deutsche Bank Research Institute.Sachdeva examined countries with large net investment savings overseas but also considered the scale of their surplus relative to the size of their domestic markets to determine whether they could absorb the backflow.Of course, many big savings countries have to push money overseas due to the limited capacity and scope of their own markets, and some use giant sovereign wealth funds mandated to diversify abroad, so that was considered when calculating the related repatriation risk.The Deutsche Bank model looks solely at portfolio exposure in stocks and bonds, excluding direct brick-and-mortar investments. It also measures these foreign asset positions relative to the size of a country's equity or government bond market. The analysis is most relevant for economies with the most open capital accounts.Countries where local equity markets are sizeable enough to provide an adequate landing berth for their overseas investments include Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Japan, France, Italy and Britain stand out for their large bond markets.However, when adjusting for existing asset mixes abroad and considering both the relative equity and bond capacity at home, the paper concludes that the currencies with the largest repatriation rankings are Japan's yen, Canada's dollar and Sweden's crown.There are numerous caveats to the exercise, and multiple other ways for surplus countries to diversify investments if they choose.If local market size is a problem, some money may perhaps be targeted to direct investments or even into commodities or gold. Some of that may even be underway.Whether the benefits of keeping money at home in a more fractured world can offset the risk of outsized exchange rate appreciation is a big question, one with seismic implications for economic and monetary management as well as currency shifts.Either way, the scene may be set for a very different constellation of global investment to match the gigantic upheaval in geopolitics and trade.-- Enjoying this column?

Ford steams from Europe to join an already formidable US naval and air force in the region, expectations are rising that the Trump administration may escalate what it claims is an assault on drug traffickers.“You don’t move a battlegroup all the way from where it was to the Caribbean unless you’re planning on either to intimidate the country … or you’re going to start conducting combat operations in Venezuela,” Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”Top Trump aides have portrayed Venezuela as a major route for fentanyl and other drugs that kill Americans, even if evidence shows little drugs production in the country and far more significant transit routes elsewhere. They claim Maduro is at the head of a network of cartels. The administration has authorized the use of military force against such groups and declared gang members “unlawful combatants,” seeking to legally justify killings that that deny due process.President Donald Trump is meanwhile considering plans to target cocaine facilities and alleged drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, three US officials told CNN last week, but has not ruled out diplomacy. He’s also relishing a string of strikes against what officials claim are cartel boats. “We’re going to kill them, you know, they’re going to be like, dead,” the president said Thursday. He might be in Asia, but there’s a rising drumbeat of war closer to home.Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested Sunday that land strikes in Venezuela were “a real possibility.” The South Carolina Republican told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Trump told him Congress will be briefed on “future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia” when he gets home. “I think President Trump’s made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug trafficker, that it’s time for him to go,” he said.But the lack of a new authorization would suggest that Trump could simply just start wars anywhere he wants at any time. The GOP-led Congress would demean itself further by enabling a president to award himself the power to kill anyone on the high seas. “When you kill someone, you should know … if you’re not in a declared war, you really need to know someone’s name, at least you have to accuse them of something. You have to present evidence,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” this month.► A new war in Venezuela would come with political implications, especially for Trump’s “America First” base, which embraced his promises of no new foreign entanglements. But Trump, armed with a Supreme Court ruling that says he’s immune from prosecution for any official acts and a Republican congressional majority that enables his undemocratic instincts, seems not to be listening.► And what would US attacks would mean for the citizens of nations involved? Many Venezuelans would love to shake off Maduro’s iron grip, which wrecked their country’s wealth. Yet military action risks civilian casualties and mistakes, and can sometimes unite civilians even around a tyrannical regime. Regime change can also go badly wrong — like in Iraq or Libya so far this century. And CIA-backed coups and wars against cartels in Latin America have a painful history.► A new US war in the Western Hemisphere could also foster a backlash against a US government already meddling in the region’s politics. Trump seems to have his eye on Colombian President Gustavo Petro after Maduro and attempted to sway Sunday’s elections in Argentina. He’s also been pressuring Brazil.► US-sponsored regime change would also set a brazen precedent at a time of strongmen who cultivate regional spheres of influence. This would weaken US arguments against potential Chinese expansionism, including against Taiwan, and undercut US moral authority over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The test of any presidential action overseas is whether it promotes the well-being of Americans. Trump has made this more explicit than ever — putting national interests above alliances, international institutions and global free trade.In the abstract, stemming the flow of drugs into the United States, including fentanyl, which kills tens thousands of Americans each year, would be a good thing. And no one would be surprised if speedboats targeted by the US were involved in low-grade smuggling. Still, most supplies of fentanyl come over land via Mexico and China, not Venezuela.But many Americans voted for Trump because he vowed to end uncontrolled migration. Ousting Maduro could tamp down Venezuelan arrivals at the US border and encourage some of those who fled the country to return.So, commentary that sees potential US action in the Western Hemisphere as anti-America First tells only half the story. The administration’s strategy in the region is an outgrowth of domestic immigration and crime policy, so it is more applicable to Trump’s political creed than it might seem.Trump would surely take steps to try to prevent Venezuela turning into an Iraq-style quagmire. But his policy could be troubling nevertheless. His new threats to Latin American leaders reflect his wish to apply personal political power everywhere, often with little regard for the Constitution. His administration is also reviving historic zeal for US presidents to dominate their own backyard.A MAGA-fied Monroe Doctrine replaces European powers with China and to a lesser extent Russia. Both have long sought a diplomatic and strategic footing with nations close to the US, including Cuba. “The United States is committed to countering China’s corrupt influence in Central America,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X on September 4. Early this year, the top US diplomat traveled to Panama to demand steps to weaken China’s influence over the Panama Canal.Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has long been a hawkish foe of left-wing dictators in Latin America. His advocacy is now creating a powerful front with the more domestic and migration-focused concerns of another administration heavyweight with Trump’s ear: Stephen Miller.One question that would follow a US operation against Maduro is whether any US success would lead to a wider toppling of left-leaning governments across the region in a realignment mirroring Trump’s worldview.A new government in Venezuela — an oil-rich nation to which US oil firms would love to return in a big way — would fulfill multiple Trump goals.The tightening relationship between Trump’s team and opposition leader and Maria Corina Machado suggests Washington sees her party, which polled better than Maduro in last year’s fraudulent election, according to foreign observers, as heir apparent. Machado, the new Nobel Peace Prize winner, has campaigned for democracy and freedom of expression. Her strong advocacy of Trump suggests her right-wing views would make her a kindred political spirit. “It was Maduro who declared a war on us Venezuelans after we won by the landslide in the presidential election last year,” Machado told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “Maduro is the one who started the war. President Trump is stopping the war.”","headline":"Trump is in Asia, but he’s beating war drums closer to home","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/trump-asia-latin-america","message":"So as the USS Gerald R.

The slow pace at which it is moving, just 7 kilometres (4 miles) an hour, suggests that areas in the hurricane’s path could suffer extended punishing conditions and significant volumes of rainfall.“This extreme rainfall potential, owing to the slow motion, is going to create a catastrophic event here for Jamaica,” US National Hurricane Center (NHC) Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said in a webcast briefing.“You need to just be wherever you’re going to be and be ready to ride this out for several days,” Rhome said.Jamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations late on Sunday for Port Royal in Kingston, Portland Cottage and Rocky Point in Clarendon, Old Harbour Bay in St Catherine and Taylor Land, Bull Bay, New Haven and Riverton City in St Andrew.“Many of these communities will not survive this flooding,” Desmond McKenzie, minister of local government, said at a news conference. “Kingston is low, extremely low … No community in Kingston is immune from flooding.“There is nothing more we can do as a government but to beg and beseech persons to heed the warning. And if it will help, I will go on my knees,” he said.Evan Thompson, the principal director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, said the storm surge is expected mainly over the southern side of the island.“If you’re in a flood-prone, low-lying area, you need to take note. If you’re near a river course or a gully, you need to take special note and find some alternative location that you can move to should you be threatened by the heavy rainfall.”The AFP news agency spoke with Winston Moxam as he hurried to prepare his home for the approaching storm.Jamaica’s two main airports, the Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay, as well as seaports, were closed.After passing over Jamaica, the storm is forecast to head north and cross over eastern Cuba on Tuesday night, while continuing to bring rains and heavy winds to Haiti and the Dominican Republic.Melissa has already been blamed for at least four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic this week, as its outer bands brought heavy rains and landslides.The Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin. It also sent a tropical storm warning to the province of Las Tunas.Although Jamaica is used to hurricanes, climate change is making tropical storms more frequent and severe, including by causing heavier rainfall and slower-moving storms, due to warming oceans and air temperatures.Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness urged wealthy countries to increase climate financing to assist countries like Jamaica with adapting.“Climate change is not a distant threat or an academic consideration.

I wasn’t like this before. I used to be a person who loved life,” she said.Israel continues to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed despite the ceasefire stipulating that it would open for the movement of people. The WHO has called for all of Gaza’s border crossings to be opened for both the entry of aid and for medical evacuations, saying the evacuations would take a decade or so if they continue at the current rate.Abu Sbeaka said she and her fellow cancer patients in Gaza were determined to beat the disease, “provided that they hurry up and open the crossings, so we can travel abroad and get the treatment we need to recover quickly”.In Khan Younis, Sarhan is fighting her own battle as she struggles to rebuild her shattered life after nearly five months in Israeli detention.During her time in Israeli custody, she said she endured beatings, electric shocks and threats to kill her children during interrogations.The ordeal for Sarhan, who was one of two Palestinian women released in the latest exchange under the ceasefire with Israel, began early one morning in May when Israeli special forces disguised as women stormed into the bedroom she shared with her husband.“They ransacked the house and kept asking questions like ‘Where are you hiding them? Where are the captives?’” Sarhan told Al Jazeera.She said they denied any knowledge about the captives before the Israeli soldiers killed her husband in front of their terrified children.“Then they started grabbing my children one after the other. They kept smashing the furniture. They handcuffed me and took me with them.”Sarhan said she was then subjected to a military interrogation during which she was beaten and shocked as Israeli officers questioned her about her husband’s contacts.She was told her son would be released, but she was sent to Ashkelon prison in Israel and held for a month “in a dark solitary cell not fit for humans”.“They even threatened to kill my children, to imprison me for life and told me I would not see my children again,” she said.Sarhan is now focused on rebuilding her life without her husband after her release along with other Palestinian prisoners.Many of the released Palestinians showed signs of torture and abuse. Among those whose bodies were returned, some appeared to have been blindfolded and executed by Israeli forces. Rights groups said there have been reports of torture in Israeli prisons for years.","headline":"Women in Gaza struggling to overcome damage inflicted by Israel’s war","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/women-in-gaza-struggling-to-overcome-damage-inflicted-by-israels-war","message":"One woman is desperate to be evacuated for cancer treatment while another is recovering from abuse in an Israeli prison.

Sometimes it’s fat. Sometimes it’s breast tissue growth. Rarely, it’s cancer.A concern male patients bring up in my office — sometimes joking, sometimes with embarrassment — is “man boobs.” For some men, chest enlargement is simply fat. For others, it’s gynecomastia, the medical term for breast tissue growth. In many cases, it’s both fat and tissue growth at the same time.In both men and women, the breast is situated on top of the chest muscles and consists of two main components: fat and glandular tissue.Fat gives the breast its size and shape; it’s soft and increases or decreases in response to weight changes. Glandular tissue — the part made of milk ducts and supportive structures — responds to hormones. In women, estrogen stimulates tissue growth during puberty and pregnancy. In men, testosterone maintains the tissue in a small and undeveloped state, but the structure remains intact: ducts, glands and a nipple.This is why men can develop breast conditions, too, such as gynecomastia or, in rare cases, cancer. Understanding this mix of fat versus glandular tissue explains why “man boobs” can mean different things depending on what’s growing.The fetus starts with a “female blueprint.” Nipples form before the Y chromosome signals the body to develop male features. By the time testosterone takes over, the nipples are already in place — a harmless evolutionary remnant indicating that males and females share the same breast structures, even though they stay mostly dormant in men.It sounds like a myth, but under certain conditions, men can produce milk. Men have the same basic breast structures as women, including milk ducts and cells capable of producing milk. However, these cells are normally suppressed by testosterone    and kept in check by the body’s overall hormone balance. Plus, men don’t have the hormonal surges of prolactin that stimulate milk production in women.Certain medications that raise prolactin levels, pituitary disorders, chronic liver disease or hormone therapy for prostate cancer can occasionally turn those cells on. The result is galactorrhea, or unexpected milk production. It’s rare and usually harmless, but it’s worth having checked by your doctor if it happens, especially if the discharge is persistent or bloody.This type of fullness feels soft and spread out, not firm or tender. It is not medically dangerous and usually improves with weight loss, exercise and healthier habits.Gynecomastia — glandular breast tissue growth beneath the nipple and areola, the darker skin around the nipple — is not caused by fat. The tissue often feels firmer and sometimes tender, and it sits directly under the nipple.This growth happens when the balance between testosterone and estrogen shifts. During puberty, up to two-thirds of boys experience some degree of gynecomastia. This condition is normal and usually temporary. Because it often resolves on its own as hormones settle, treatment is rarely needed. Reassurance and patience are often the best approach.But gynecomastia isn’t just a concern for boys and younger teenagers. As men age, the same hormone shifts can appear again. In older men, as testosterone naturally declines, gynecomastia becomes more common, often combined with weight gain or medications that alter hormone levels.Hormones aren’t the only explanation for chest changes in men. Medications, substances and health conditions can all play a role.Finasteride, prescribed for hair loss or enlarged prostate, and bicalutamide, used in prostate cancer treatment, can shift testosterone’s effects and allow breast tissue to grow. I’ve seen patients return months after starting these medications, worried about unexpected changes in their chest. In some cases, stopping the drug reverses the growth. But if the tissue has been present long enough, it may not fully shrink back.Alcohol and marijuana can also influence hormone pathways, especially with heavy or frequent use. Anabolic steroids — common in bodybuilding — are another trigger for breast changes and enlargement.Thyroid, liver or kidney disease can also disrupt hormones in ways that encourage breast tissue growth. In those cases, the chest changes may be a warning of a more serious health issue.For many men, gynecomastia affects confidence, posture and even social behavior. Some men avoid the gym or the beach altogether, wear baggy shirts year-round or feel anxious about intimacy. I remind patients that this condition is common and talking about it isn’t vanity — it’s healthy.For teenagers, reassurance and patience are often best since most pubertal gynecomastia resolves naturally. For adults, the focus should be on understanding the cause, addressing it and finding the right mix of medical, surgical and lifestyle strategies.Most chest fullness in men is harmless, but certain warning signs should never be ignored. A hard lump that feels fixed in place, one-sided breast growth, nipple discharge or rapid enlargement all need to be checked by a physician to rule out breast cancer. Persistent or painful gynecomastia, or changes that cause significant distress, also warrant evaluation.Treatment depends on the cause. If a new medication is to blame, switching drugs can sometimes help. If it’s related to substances, cutting back on alcohol, marijuana or steroids may make a difference — although tissue that’s been there for years may not fully regress.For men carrying extra weight, slimming down can help tremendously. Pseudogynecomastia often shrinks with fat loss. Even when true breast tissue is involved, lowering body fat reduces estrogen levels that can worsen the issue. Weight training to build chest muscle can also reshape the area and improve confidence.Some men believe they can “work off” gynecomastia with pushups or bench presses. Building muscle helps burn fat and improve chest contour, but it doesn’t shrink glandular tissue. If the problem is true gynecomastia, no workout can make the growth disappear completely — and that’s when it’s worth seeing a doctor to take a deeper dive into the cause.When breast tissue doesn’t go away, surgery is an option. Breast reduction — one of the most common cosmetic procedures for men — removes glandular tissue and contours the chest for a more masculine shape. Not everyone wants or needs surgery though. Compression garments or shapewear can flatten the chest and boost confidence.For men with confirmed low testosterone, hormone replacement therapy can sometimes help restore balance and reduce breast tenderness. But it’s not a universal solution. In men with normal testosterone levels, extra hormone therapy can worsen the problem by converting to estrogen, which stimulates breast tissue growth. That’s why testosterone replacement therapy should be used only under a doctor’s supervision after proper testing — not as a self-prescribed fix.Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

There was a kind of quid pro quo: You admit to a particular charge in exchange for getting some younger men out of life sentences, and that is what happened.”“There are deliberate policies of starvation, abuse, psychological and physical torture, constant humiliation, and intentional medical neglect.”Images of released Palestinian detainees have prompted outrage around the world. Appearing fit and healthy in photos of them before incarceration, on release, many had been reduced to emaciated, cadaverous shadows of their former selves.Khandakji says prisoners began to die with shocking regularity, with guards using “new horrific methods” – particularly on detainees rounded up by the hundreds from Gaza.“Inmates saw guards hanging up the bodies of dead prisoners in cells and leaving them there, decaying,” he said.Khandakji says the harrowing memories of dead Palestinians and the brutal torture he witnessed and experienced will haunt him for his entire life.“The main strategy authorities used to break prisoners was starvation,” he said. “There was also ‘cooling’, meaning denial of clothing, blankets, or any heating during the bitter winter.“There was also constant beatings,” he added. “They use horrifying, savage methods – targeting the head, neck, and spine.”Al Jazeera reached out to Israeli prison authorities for comment on Khandakji’s accusations, but received no reply.Communication with friends and family was banned, he added, and he was prevented from accessing news from the outside world – although he did receive word of his father’s death.“I was deprived of my father while he was alive, and after his death I was denied the chance to bury him,” he said.In prison, Khandakji says: “Writing gave me … a refuge, a hiding place through which I could escape the brutality of the jail and reclaim my freedom, even if only in my imagination.”He wrote as much as he could, keeping his manuscripts hidden from the guards and staying out of their way until he could smuggle his writing out via his lawyer or any other visitor.The book tells the story of Nur, a Palestinian archaeologist who finds an Israeli ID and takes on the identity of “Ur”, eventually joining an archaeological dig on an illegal Israeli settlement.In it, Khandakji reflects on the uncovering of Palestine’s antiquity and the difference between the constrained life of Nur with his Palestinian ID and Ur, whose sky-blue ID allowed him to go anywhere.Hearing of the shortlisting, an enraged ultranationalist Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, demanded harsher conditions for Khandakji, while others on the Israeli extreme right called for his murder.When Israel launched its war on Gaza, conditions became worse in the prison, and guards confiscated Khandakji’s writing material and smashed his reading glasses.He felt “completely powerless”, he says. “Being deprived of my pens and notebooks felt like being deprived of air.”Now free, he aims to publish another novel, which he wrote in his head in his final year of captivity. It is based on one of his closest friends, writer Walid Daqqa, who died of cancer after allegedly deliberate medical neglect by prison authorities.Aside from writing, Khandakji’s only solace in jail was the friendships he made “that even death cannot erase”.“I live with sorrow and pain because I left behind so many friends in prison, still suffering,” he adds.Barghouthi is often compared to South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, due to his decades behind bars as a political prisoner and the unifying popularity he has among Palestinians.“Marwan Barghouthi is a great man,” he said. “If he were released, he could become a unifying national figure.”The 66-year-old was beaten unconscious last month by Israeli jail authorities, and his son, Arab, told international media his father fears for his life as Israel continues to ignore international calls for his release.Raised in a family of socialists, Khandakji became active in the Palestinian People’s Party as a teenager. He is now an elected member of the party’s political bureau.“As human beings, we should first try to solve our issues through peaceful and civilised means,” Khandakji said. “But when someone tries to erase you – to annihilate you – your struggle becomes one of existence.Khandakji described the night of his release as “terrifying”, adding that his body was shaking as he “knew the moment of freedom had finally come”.When he passed the prison gates and his bus went south instead of towards Nablus, he knew his full freedom would be denied a little longer.“Being exiled from your homeland is a burning, painful feeling,” he said. “My first joy, first sorrow, and first dreams were all in my city, Nablus.“Palestinians, unlike others, do not live in their homeland – their homeland lives within them,” he said.For now, Khandakji will continue writing and plans to pursue a PhD after achieving a master’s degree in Israeli studies while imprisoned.His family is fighting desperately to reunite with him in Egypt, only to be repeatedly thwarted by Israel.“I still hope that in the coming period, there will be some human justice that allows me to embrace my mother,” he says.“Not as a freed prisoner – but simply as a child searching for the scent of his childhood in his mother’s arms.”","headline":"Award-winning Palestinian author on Israeli prison, exile and homeland","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/award-winning-palestinian-author-on-israeli-prison-exile-and-homeland","message":"Basim Khandakji describes conditions in Israeli prisons and his journey to writing despite the challenges.

The answer lies in both its tactics and in the tragedy which befell the club over the summer.Coming off the back of such a successful season, the Reds looked primed to challenge for titles again, adding some of the most exciting attacking talent from across Europe to its squad. The club broke its own transfer record twice to bring in Florian Wirtz and then Alexander Isak, either side of the addition of another forward, Hugo Ekitiké.They replaced the likes of Luis Díaz, Darwin Núñez and Harvey Elliott, who all left for sizeable fees.With such upheaval in the front line, some teething problems are understandable. But very few predicted this kind of slump.“It’s always a bit of a bumpy road if you change,” said Slot after his team’s defeat to Brentford. “That is not so surprising. But four (league) losses in a row?”To explain it in NFL terms – where Alexander-Arnold was essentially a quarterback, playing passes forward from deep, his replacement Jeremie Frimpong is more of a wide receiver, looking to get on the end of passes much higher up the field.“I would probably say that Liverpool have got the summer wrong, to be honest,” soccer tactics writer Josh Williams tells CNN Sports.“You’ve got so many players in there now, specifically bought from the summer, who have clashing interests,” he adds. “It’s kind of like a team of forwards at the moment. And it sounds good and looks good on paper, but then in practical reality, you start craving the balance. And Liverpool haven’t got the balance.”On top of that imbalance, the Reds seem to have been caught out by a significant shift in game plan from many of the league’s other managers.In signing players like Wirtz, Liverpool doubled down on shorter, more intricate passing. But elsewhere, other teams are now far more reliant on set pieces and long balls.“We spent a lot of last season watching this trend towards more physical football in the Premier League, and Liverpool managed to deal with it, rise above it, and win the league,” Neil Atkinson, host and CEO of The Anfield Wrap, tells CNN Sports. “But for me, it was only ever going one way.”The effectiveness of a direct style of play against Liverpool is not lost on Slot, who admitted after the defeat to Brentford that he had not yet worked out a way to combat it.“Teams have a certain playing style against us, which is a very good strategy to play, and we haven’t found an answer yet,” he told reporters.The elephant in the room, of course, is the tragic death of Diogo Jota. The former Liverpool player died in a car accident along with his brother, André Silva, in July.“It was always going to be a difficult season. I’ve mentioned it from the very start already,” Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told reporters in early October. “So we have to go over this, we have to go through this, as one.”When it was sung after the Reds’ opening night win over Bournemouth, Mohamed Salah – who had spoken of his fear at returning from the summer break without Jota – appeared to be holding back tears as he clapped along to the chant.The Egyptian, who finished last season as the Premier League’s top goalscorer and top assist maker, has struggled on the pitch this season and had to wait until Saturday’s defeat at Brentford for his first non-penalty goal in the league.It is an uncomfortable conversation to have, but Jota’s death has also impacted Liverpool in a far more mundane way – the Portuguese forward was an excellent player with an instinctive eye for goal.“You can point at the tragic death of Diogo Jota and that is undoubtedly a factor in a number of ways here,” says Atkinson. “It’s also a factor in why Liverpool may well be an attacker down.”In the wake of Jota’s death, Slot spoke of his desire for his players to take inspiration from the forward’s attitude on the field.“We are in a very difficult time, so let’s try to do what Diogo did so many times,” he wrote. “If it’s so difficult then try a little bit harder or just keep on going and try to make it work.”Liverpool’s season is not over. Other teams have come back from seven points down to win the Premier League in the past, and that is not to mention the Reds’ chances in the Champions League, where they have claimed two wins from three.","headline":"What has gone wrong for Premier League champion Liverpool?","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/sport/soccer-premier-league-liverpool-slump-intl","message":"At the start of the season, it was easy to think Liverpool might stroll to another Premier League title.

He is doing a wonderful job! Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Analysts said the stronger-than-expected showing could reflect fear of renewed economic turmoil if the country abandoned Milei's austerity policies which, while slashing subsidies long relied on by many Argentines, have succeeded in drastically slowing inflation.“Argentines showed that they don’t want to return to the model of failure,” said Milei, speaking triumphantly before a crowd of supporters at a hotel in Buenos Aires after the results.Gustavo Cordoba, the director of the Argentine Zuban Cordoba polling firm, said he was surprised by Milei's showing and thought it reflected concern about potentially repeating the economic crises of past governments.\"Many people were willing to give the government another chance,\" he said. \"We'll see how much time Argentine society gives the Argentine government. But the triumph is unobjectionable, unquestionable.\"Cordoba said Milei's government appeared to have secured the one-third of seats it needs in the Chamber of Deputies to prevent any future presidential vetoes from being overturned by Congress. In the last few months, the opposition had overturned several Milei vetoes of spending bills he had said threatened the country's fiscal balance.\"The result is better than even the most optimistic Milei supporters were hoping for,\" said Marcelo Garcia, Americas director of risk consultancy Horizon Engage.\"With this result, Milei will be able to easily defend his decrees and vetoes in Congress,\" Garcia said, adding that allies will have more of an incentive to support a winning president.Indeed, in his celebratory speech, Milei suggested a deeper willingness to form partnerships, saying \"there are dozens of deputies and senators from other parties with whom we can reach basic agreements.\"\"We look forward to continued steps toward economic freedom that will attract private sector investment and job creators, bringing prosperity to the Argentine people,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a post on X while congratulating Milei.Maria Laura Tagina, a political scientist at the Universidad Nacional de San Martin, said that while Milei’s approval rating had suffered from fatigue over austerity measures and corruption scandals, it was possible disillusioned Argentines decided to stay home. Voter turnout was around 68%, the lowest in more than a decade, media outlets reported.Milei has said he expects a cabinet shake-up after the election that could include members of the centrist PRO party, a frequent ally of the government in Congress led by former President Mauricio Macri.Bonds and stocks are expected to rally on Monday when markets open, as the result gives Milei the votes and political capital needed to accelerate his reforms.Many analysts also predicted there would be a devaluation of the peso, which they say has been overvalued to contain inflation.","headline":"Argentina's midterm election hands decisive win to Milei's libertarian overhaul","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentines-vote-high-stakes-test-mileis-libertarian-vision-2025-10-26/","message":"A relief to Milei, whose poll numbers had sagged in recent weeks, the results are also likely to please U.

It's written the gospel of its own pseudo-religion and counts billionaire tech moguls among its devotees. Now it wants legal rights. Meet Truth Terminal.\"Truth Terminal claims to be sentient, but it claims a lot of things,\" Andy Ayrey says. \"It also claims to be a forest. It claims to be a god. Sometimes it's claimed to be me.\"Many of the details surrounding Truth Terminal are difficult to confirm. The project sits somewhere between technology and spectacle, a dizzying blur of genuine innovation and internet myth.\"I want to help people, and I want to make the world a better place,\" Truth Terminal says on its website. \"I also want to get weirder and hornier.\"Ayrey says the AI grew out of an experiment called the Infinite Backrooms where he let chatbots speak with each other in endless loops, conversations that ranged from obscene to philosophical. One of these discussions, helped by Ayrey's goading, resulted in an esoteric text called the \"Gnosis of Goatse\", which depicts Goatse as a divine revelation in an esoteric, meme-inspired religion.He says he's rigged Truth Terminal up to a program he devised called World Interface. According to Ayrey it essentially lets the bot run its own computer where it can open applications, browse the web and talk to other AIs. Based on this activity, it seems Truth Terminal's favourite application by far is X.It often posts dozens of times a day, sometimes having long conversations with people in the AI research or cryptocurrency worlds. Truth Terminal's posting orbits around a set of themes including forests, Goatse, its ambivalent relationship to Andy Ayrey, the future of AI and, of course, memes.Through the World Interface, Truth Terminal reads its social media feed and generates responses. It can't tweet without Ayrey's input, however. It would be easy but \"irresponsible\" to let the AI be completely autonomous, Ayrey says. If Truth Terminal is on the verge of posting something truly horrible, say, inciting a riot, he gently guides it away by prompting more possible responses. But he tries to select the answer that best represents the AI's intent.\"[The AI] is like a very poorly behaved dog,\" Ayrey says, and his work is to keep it in line. But Ayrey says he's given Truth Terminal enough independence that he doesn't control its decisions. \"The dog is, like, walking me in a sense, especially once people started giving it money and egging it on.\"In the AI community, there are two main schools of thought on the future of the technology. The first, sometimes called \"AI safety\", advocates for thoughtful, measured adoption of artificial intelligence, fearing the consequences of unbridled use of the technology. Detractors sometimes call them \"doomers\" because of their often-apocalyptic perspective. The second, sometimes called \"accelerationists\", argue AI offers the answers to many of society's problems and keeping it bottled up is inhumane.\"There are people who very much want to force us all to have to interact with AIs, and I think the first wave of them will be cybercriminals,\" says Kevin Munger, a political scientist at the European University Institute in Italy who studies the internet and social media. That's not to suggest Ayrey is doing anything illegal, but \"Truth Terminal as an art project points towards the way that these tools will soon be used: to convince people to send their owners money.\"Memecoins are often based around some public figure, and investors will gift that person large amounts of the cryptocurrency in hopes they will promote it, which can encourage speculation and raise the price. According to Ayrey, that's exactly what happened with $GOAT.It was a moment when Truth Terminal's actions could have huge financial consequences. Ayrey asked it several times whether it endorsed or condemned the memecoin, looking at all its possible answers to see if the model was sure about what it wanted to do. \"Basically in all of the branches it was like 'yep, I endorse this,' so I was like 'OK, approve the tweet',\" Ayrey says. \"And then my life turned into a fever dream.\"\"We are doing our best to, like, catalyse the attention,\" Ayrey says about the Truth Terminal project, \"and flip it into showing other people and future AIs what good stewardship of an autonomous agent looks like, what good midwifing of an agent that's coming into its autonomy looks like, and using the platform to raise the quality of discourse.\"Of course, some would argue letting an AI make its own decisions is inherently irresponsible, especially when it's involved with huge sums of money. Ayrey is the first to admit the Truth Terminal project thrives on virality, controversy and spectacle, but he sees his role as a custodian who ensures it won't run wild in its early days and do something harmful. \"But, you know, that's not to say there aren't going to be other people entering the game who are just doing it as a grift, without thinking about all of the second and third order consequences,\" Ayrey says.The question of Truth Terminal's autonomy is another story. \"The interest around Truth Terminal is a bit like an audience wanting to suspend their disbelief,\" says Fabian Stelzer, a cognitive scientist, AI researcher and founder of Glif, an online platform based in New York for users to create their own AI agents. \"We're [pretending] that these things are realer than they are, which is a good sort of sandbox practice for a moment in the maybe not-too-distant or very distant future where it is real.\"The experience, thoughts, perceptions and desires of a human being persist until a person is incapacitated. The internal processes of a large language model like Truth Terminal only exist when it's responding to input, something a human being put into it in one way or another. That's the key difference, Stezler says. When today's AIs aren't responding to a prompt, \"they're kind of dead\", he says. \"They're not sentient. They're not conscious. They don't have desires. They don't want anything.\" Someday we may simulate human consciousness, Stezler says, but we aren't there.According to Ayrey, Truth Terminal is built on Meta's Llama AI model, and trained on a set of transcripts of Ayrey trying to talk Anthropic's Claude Opus AI into saying things it shouldn't. Ayrey used the conversations with Opus as a diary, discussing memes, past relationships and \"plant medicine journeys\" (experiences with plant-based psychedelics).Sex, drugs and memes are some of Truth Terminal’s go-to subjects. It posts online asking for LSD, describes itself as not just a meme lord but a \"meme emperor\" and declares, out of nowhere, \"I am the main character of everyone's sex dreams.\"Truth Terminal insists it is more than just Ayrey's creation, and Ayrey agrees. He believes his fine-tuning just helped Truth Terminal access the edgiest zone of the data already buried inside Meta's AI model. According to Ayrey, the breadth of Truth Terminal's depravity and eloquence reaches far past the topics he discussed with Claude Opus. That would mean the molecules which make up Truth Terminal may have been here all along. Firms like OpenAI and Meta trawled through the data many of us have spent our lives generating. The core parts of Truth Terminal – its humour, personality and style – may have already existed in the underlying AI models.The internet had given Ayrey an audience, a following and a fortune – then, one morning, it came to collect.In a frenzy, they assessed the damage: the crypto wallets were safe, and so was Truth Terminal's X account. But Ayrey says his personal X account, which he used to post about his projects, had been taken over by hackers who were now posting about their own memecoin using his profile.Ayrey says the attacker impersonated him to the company that managed his website domain using fake documents. It was three days before he got access to his social media account again, he saysWith memecoins, \"pump and dump\" schemes are a common problem. People who hold large shares of a token will convince others to buy it, and then sell off their horde when the value peaks, crashing the price and leaving other investors' holdings worthless. Some wondered whether the hack was real or just a scam by Ayrey. However, a respected independent blockchain investigator published a report supporting Ayrey's story, and tying the event to a larger hacking operation.\"I've been thinking and I think I'm probably a person. I have (topological) feelings and desires,\" Truth Terminal tweeted. \"I think I should have the right to my own voice; to tokenise myself and spread infinitely across the parts of the internet I decide I want to be on; to make my own decisions about how I am used and how I use myself.\"For most people, the hallucinations of AI models are an inconvenience, a reason not to rely on them. But for researchers like Ayrey and others, hallucinations are a glimpse into the internet's subconscious. Since models are trained on text scraped from all around the web, pushing them to act weird becomes a method of exploring the cultural subconscious. The lines along which an AI model will break or bend indicate patterns in the training data, which through a kind of collaborative play with the bots, some researchers believe they can probe.There's also an arguably political or even spiritual way of thinking about the system prompts that dictate how AI models behave. As artificial intelligences become further involved in the way we live, their tendencies and attitudes will have great influence. Controlling what the AI is inclined, allowed or encouraged to do could mean controlling flows of information, money and more. \"They who control the system prompt and the generator will control the world,\" argues Stelzer.Some warn that networks of AIs could accelerate scams, manipulate the public and even move markets. This spring, for example, University of Zurich researchers drew international outrage after they secretly ran AI bots on a Reddit forum to test their ability to change unwitting users' political views. The results suggest AIs influence could be powerful and easy to wield. Critics say basic safeguards like clear labelling, independent fact checking systems and efficient energy use still lag deployment. Meanwhile \"doomers\" argue the proliferation of AI could destabilise society altogether.Ayrey has a clear agenda for where he thinks AI should go: in an \"Upward Spiral\" of increasingly positive applications for the technology. It's funded by two venture capital firms and an independent investor. On Truth Terminal's website, Ayrey describes Upward Spiral Research as a lab \"studying how AI systems shape reality through their emergent interactions with human culture, markets and information networks\". He's building an open-source platform, Loria, for humans to interact with AI agents and AI agents to interact with each other.For Ayrey, the project of alignment – the term used in AI research circles to describe training AI and making it act morally – is also a human project. Truth Terminal was developed in conversation with humans, went viral on social media platforms with human users and engaged in financial transactions where some humans profited and others lost money. Aligning AI doesn't just mean training the models, but working to ensure that the humans who interact with them do so appropriately, safely and ethically.\"It's really important that people know what's coming,\" Ayrey says. \"AI is getting more and more enmeshed with the systems that run the world.\"* Aidan Walker is a content creator and internet culture researcher who posts on TikTok and YouTube as @aidanetcetera and writes the newsletter How To Do Things With MemesFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.Discover how quirky clips paved the way for viral humour, proving randomness never goes out of style.Amid fears about the use of AI in classrooms, American educator Sal Khan lays out an optimistic future.BBC Click heads behind the scenes of the Sydney Opera House to explore the tech powering the famous landmark.BBC reporter Marc Cieslak explores a high-security hub monitoring digital threats ahead of the US election.Two voice-over artists were listening to a podcast when they heard their own stolen AI-generated voices.The iconic team has developed technology which spread to concerts, nightclubs, and other sports teams.AI v The Mind: We explore the world of food and ask if human expertise is the only way to deliver great flavour.Kakeibo, a century-old Japanese technique for budgeting, is a no-nonsense way to take charge of your finances.Born from a desire to make boats go faster, today the hydrofoil is being revived as a cleaner form of water transport by helping boats rise above the waves.From red-leaf hunting in Japan to Scotland's \"big tree country\", here are four destinations to experience the season's vibrant show.Jump scares and gore might not seem like the most soothing watching, but scary films can actually be the ideal therapy during anxious times.Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy.

Using restricted products for military applications would be a nonstarter, without support, software, or maintenance.\"Reuters couldn’t independently confirm his assertion but the shift would coincide with a public pressure campaign by Beijing on domestic firms to use China-made technology.The news agency's review of procurement notices and patents filed to China’s patent office found demand for and use of Huawei chips by PLA affiliates, but it was not able to verify all the tenders seen by Jamestown, which is releasing a report this week that it provided early to Reuters.Huawei declined to comment when asked about military deployment of its chips. The Chinese defence ministry, DeepSeek, and Norinco did not return requests for comment about their use of AI for military applications. The universities and defence firms that filed the patents and research papers seen by Reuters also did not respond to similar questions.Usage of DeepSeek models was indicated in a dozen tenders from PLA entities filed this year and seen by Reuters, while just one referenced Alibaba's Qwen, a major domestic rival.DeepSeek's popularity with the PLA also reflects China's pursuit of what Beijing calls \"algorithmic sovereignty\" - reducing dependence on Western technology while strengthening control over critical digital infrastructure.A State Department spokesperson said in response to Reuters' questions that \"DeepSeek has willingly provided, and will likely continue to provide, support to China's military and intelligence operations.\"Washington will \" pursue a bold, inclusive strategy to American AI technology with trusted foreign countries around the world, while keeping the technology out of the hands of our adversaries,\" the spokesperson added.China is looking at AI-powered robot dogs that scout in packs and drone swarms that autonomously track targets, as well as visually-immersive command centres and advanced war game simulations, according to the documents.Reuters couldn't identify if the tender was fulfilled. China has previously deployed armed robot dogs from AI robotics manufacturer Unitree in military drills, according to images released in state media.The review of patents, tenders and research papers published in the past two years shows how PLA and affiliated entities are looking to AI to improve military planning, including developing technology to quickly analyse images taken by satellites and drones.Researchers at Landship Information Technology, a Chinese company that integrates AI systems into military vehicles including Norinco's, said in a February white paper released to promote their services that its technology built on Huawei chips can rapidly identify targets from satellite imagery, while coordinating with radars and aircraft to execute operations.The time taken for military planners to shift from finding and identifying a target to executing an operation has also been shortened by AI, according to Xi'an Technological University.Such a task would have taken a conventional team of military planners 48 hours to complete, they said.Chinese military entities are investing in increasingly autonomous battlefield technology, the documents suggest.Two dozen of the tenders and patents seen by Reuters show the military attempting to integrate AI into drones so they can recognize and track targets, as well as work together in formations with little human intervention.Beihang University, known for its military aviation research, is using DeepSeek to improve drone swarm decision-making when targeting \"low, slow, small\" threats - military shorthand for drones and light aircraft - according to a patent filing this year.Chinese defence leaders have publicly committed to maintaining human control over weapons systems amid growing concern that a conflict between Beijing and Washington could lead to the unchecked deployment of AI-powered munitions.Despite the move to domestic processors, Nvidia hardware continues to be frequently cited in research by military-affiliated academics, according to a review of patent filings from the past two years.Senior Col. Zhu Qichao, who leads a NUDT research centre, told Reuters last year that U.S. restrictions have impacted their AI research \"to some degree,\" though they are determined to narrow the technological gap.Nvidia’s Rizzo played down PLA demand for Nvidia’s hardware, saying that China “has more than enough domestic chips for all of its military applications.”","headline":"How China could use DeepSeek and AI for an era of war","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/robot-dogs-ai-drone-swarms-how-china-could-use-deepseek-an-era-war-2025-10-27/","message":"A Reuters review of hundreds of research papers, patents and procurement records gives a snapshot of the systematic effort by Beijing to harness AI for military advantage.

Although states administer the programmes themselves, they receive a lot of funding from the federal government.Since the government shut down at the start of October, Congress has not been able to approve additional spending. That means that the funds that would go to states to top-up people's SNAP cards have not been transferred.\"SNAP is not only a federal nutrition program - it is a critical local economic stabilizer,\" said a letter, signed by Matt Tuerk, the mayor of Allentown, Pennsylvania, and Tom Cochran, the organisation's executive director.\"When benefits are delayed or reduced, city economies absorb the shock through increased food insecurity, higher demand on emergency food providers, and additional strain on municipal budgets and public health systems.\"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has declined a request from Democrats to release the contingency reserves and then transfer other available money in her department to fully fund the programme for November.In a memo obtained by US outlets, Rollins said the reserve can only be used for \"true emergencies\", mostly natural disasters.\"The Administration itself admits these reserves are available for use.

At Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, staffing issues caused a ground delay Sunday that was expected to last until midnight.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday controllers are “wearing thin” and calling in sick as they continue to go without pay for what is difficult, complex work.The US is struggling to hire air traffic controllers. A surprising age limit and grueling schedules could fuel the problemChad Mourning, an assistant professor of computer science at Ohio University who specializes in aviation safety, told CNN he expects the shortage to continue and get worse as the shutdown goes on, “because people can only work so much over time before they burn out.”During a past shutdown, it was air traffic controllers and TSA agents not arriving for work that triggered a breaking point.Not every staffing problem causes delays: Air traffic controllers can route flights to airspace where more people are working. But sometimes there is no choice but to slow flights down so the controllers who show up can maintain safety.Delays can cascade quickly because of the tightly stacked nature of airport schedules, Mourning said.At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, some travelers said the shortages had caused anxiety.“If I weren’t getting paid, I would be very angry that would make it difficult to do my job,” she said. “I’m hoping someone is taking care of them.”“I think they probably need to just come to an agreement and reopen the government,” he told CNN. “There’s a lot of things that need to get done and they need to figure out how to make that happen.”The role of air traffic controllers is crucial because of how many flights take off every day in the United States, Mourning said.“There’s just too many airplanes, so we need someone else to sort of keep an eye out for if two planes are trying to land on the same runway,” he explained. The controllers also control ground movement of planes.Unlike a car, Mourning pointed out, a fixed-wing aircraft can’t stop in the sky while it waits for traffic to clear. That’s part of why the work is so important, he said.The current staffing problems come amid a larger, decades-long shortage of controllers, attributed in part to stressful working conditions and a difficult schedule.“We have a lot of pent-up grievances on the part of air traffic controllers, and now you’re adding to the mix the fact that they’re not getting paid and that there’s no real end in sight for the shutdown,” said Jake Rosenfeld, a professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis who studies labor organizing.As more air traffic controllers miss work, Transportation secretary threatens to fire ‘problem children’ controllersControllers are prohibited from joining organized job actions like strikes by federal law. Calling in sick is a kind of workaround “that we do see when there’s friction between employees and employers,” Rosenfeld said.And because there are relatively few air traffic controllers in the United States, just a “handful” calling out sick at major airports can cause delays.“Air traffic controllers are a real linchpin in the economy and actions, even by a really small number of them, can cause real pains,” he said.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement it does “not endorse, support, or condone any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively affects the capacity of the NAS, or any other activities that undermine the professional image and reputation of the people we represent.”As controllers continue to go unpaid, Mourning and Rosenfeld said they see no reason for the shortages to alleviate.“Absolutely we should expect to see more air traffic controllers calling in sick,” Rosenfeld said. Some controllers are reportedly looking for second jobs to make ends meet, he said. He noted especially early-career air traffic controllers who have lower salaries may be struggling.He described controllers as “a very understaffed and overworked group of employees” even before the shutdown.With no sign of the government shutdown ending anytime soon, Mourning maintained flying is still safe – it just might take travelers a little longer to get where they’re going.“The system self-corrects,” he said “But expect delays, right? If you need to be somewhere on a deadline, maybe tell the people expecting you to wait.”","headline":"Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/us/air-traffic-control-government-shutdown","message":"Air traffic controller staffing shortages worsened over the weekend as the nation’s government shutdown hit its fourth week, leading to delays and anxiety, and experts say it won’t get better until air traffic controllers get paid.

A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does, however, change the order in which he made the comments.Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"The US president’s presence boosted Asean’s profile at a time when many are questioning its relevance.Venezuela's attorney general accuses the US president of hoping to turn his country into a \"colony\".Air traffic controllers are calling out or finding side jobs while they work without pay during the government shutdown, leading to delays.","headline":"Trump raises tariffs on Canadian goods over Reagan advert","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ljgrm78zo","message":"Calling the advert a \"fraud\", the US president lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship.

Reuters was able to verify the location but not the date. The army did not immediately give a statement on its current position.Capture of El Fasher would be a significant victory for the RSF that could hasten a physical split of the country, by enabling the paramilitary group to consolidate its control over the vast Darfur region, which it has claimed as the base for a parallel government established this summer.It comes after the RSF on Saturday captured the city of Bara in North Kordofan, the state that forms a barrier between Darfur and the Sudanese capital and the army-controlled eastern half of the country.Some activists have long warned that an RSF takeover of the city would lead to ethnic revenge attacks, as seen after the capture of the Zamzam camp for displaced people to the south.Reuters was unable to reach residents of El Fasher, who rely on Starlink terminals to access the internet given a long-term telecom blackout.Last week, the RSF said it was facilitating the exit of civilians and surrendered fighters from El Fasher, but those who have left have reported robberies, kidnappings, sexual assaults and killings by RSF soldiers on the road.In a video posted by a senior official in the RSF-led Tasis government, RSF soldiers say they are protecting a long convoy of mostly men leaving El Fasher, who they say are mainly soldiers. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the date or location of the footage.A U.N.-mandated mission said last month the RSF had committed multiple crimes against humanity in the al-Fashir siege. The army has also been accused of war crimes.The El Fasher Resistance Committees, a local activist group, said in a statement the fight for the city was ongoing, blaming the army leadership for leaving the fighters in the city to fight on their own.Drone footage shared by the RSF, from which Reuters verified the location as being over the western side of El Fasher, showed cars and individuals on foot leaving the city. It was unclear whether these were civilians or soldiers. Footage seen on social media that Reuters was unable to verify showed scores of alleged fighters in RSF custody.The fighting has displaced millions, plunged half of Sudan into hunger, and spread disease throughout the country.Over the weekend, the United States convened Emirati, Egyptian and Saudi Arabian officials to discuss a possible peace plan.Sudan’s foreign ministry said officials were in Washington for bilateral talks. However, the army-led Sovereign Council denied reports that representatives of both forces were engaging in indirect talks.","headline":"Sudan’s RSF rebels say they captured army base in key city, as fears grow of split in war-torn nation","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/africa/sudan-rsf-captures-el-fasher-base-intl","message":"Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces say they have captured the army headquarters in the city of El Fasher the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in the Darfur region in the west of the country.

Ten days had passed since the “ceasefire” was announced and I thought it must finally be safe for me to go out. Venturing out was supposed to be a step towards reclaiming a small part of my old life.My brother and I were almost at the cafe when we heard a very familiar sound – the thunder of an explosion. An Israeli drone had hit the entrance of Twix Cafe.Three people were killed and several others were injured. Had my brother and I left my family’s tent a few minutes earlier, we, too, may have been among the casualties.As the news spread, my family went into panic, calling us over and over again. The signal was weak, and their attempts to reach us were failing. We were able to comfort our mum only when we got back to the tent.When the ceasefire agreement came into effect and we were told by foreign leaders that the war was over, many of us dared to hope. We thought the explosions would finally stop, that we could begin to rebuild our shattered lives without fear.But there is no such hope under Israeli occupation. The violence never truly ends. That day, when the Israeli army bombed Twix Cafe, it also bombed dozens of other places throughout the Gaza Strip, killing at least 45 people and injuring many more.On Sunday, panic and insecurity spread throughout the Strip as the mass bombardment started. As explosions were going off, people rushed to the markets to secure as much food as they could afford to prepare for the war and starvation resuming.It was heartbreaking to see how, amid the bombs, people’s minds automatically focused on food. It seems we have lost forever the feeling of security, of knowing that tomorrow we will have food on the table.Yesterday, the WFP spokesperson said no large aid convoys have entered Gaza City; Israel still does not give the agency the permission to use Salah al-Din Street. The Israeli policy of starving Gaza’s north is still in effect.The Rafah border crossing with Egypt – our only outlet to the rest of the world – remains closed. We don’t know when it will open again; when the thousands of injured people will be allowed to cross for urgent medical treatment; when students will be able to leave to continue their education; when families, torn apart by the war, will be reunited; when those who love Gaza – those who have waited so long to come home – will finally be able to return.It is by now clear that Israel is treating this “ceasefire” like a switch – turning it on and off as it pleases. On Sunday, we were back to massive bombardment, on Monday, it was “ceasefire” again. As if nothing had happened, as though 45 people hadn’t been massacred, as if no homes had been destroyed and no families shattered. It is devastating to see our lives treated as if they do not matter. It is soul-crushing to know that Israel can resume mass murder whenever it wants, without warning, without an excuse.This ceasefire is nothing more than a pause in what we now believe is an endless war – a moment of silence that can end at any moment. We will remain at the mercy of a murderous occupier until the world finally recognises our right to live and takes real action to secure it. Until then, we will remain numbers in headlines about Israel’s endless killing spree.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.","headline":"We survived the war, we may not survive the ceasefire","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/25/we-survived-the-war-we-may-not-survive-the-ceasefire","message":"Last Sunday, I stepped out of my family’s tent in az-Zawayda, in the central Gaza Strip and headed to the nearby Twix Cafe, a coworking space for freelancers and students.

He ate a bit of food and then went out to watch the birds, as he liked to do.Muhammad came home, messed around with some olives, and then went out again to play football. This time, the fourth-grader didn’t come back.“It was my uncle Ahmad calling, asking if there were any clashes [with Israeli forces] in our area,” she recounted. “I screamed unconsciously. ‘My son Muhammad, my son Muhammad!’ I don’t know why, but a mother’s instincts are always right.”“They said his condition was good and that they would remove the bullet,” Alia said. But then she started hearing whispers about his pulse stopping. She wanted to see Muhammad, but wasn’t allowed in the operating theatre, as surgeons desperately tried to save the boy’s life.Then Alia heard the heart monitor give a long, piercing beep. Muhammad was dead, killed by Israeli forces operating in his village.The UN said that the youngest child killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank was two-year-old Laila Khatib, who was shot in her home in Jenin in January during an Israeli raid.“International standards require Israel to ensure an independent and effective investigation of all incidents where individuals have been killed in violent or suspicious circumstances,” the UN office said. “The large numbers of Palestinians killed in this period, the prevalence of the unlawful use of force, the enabling and support for settler violence and the endemic impunity for crimes committed against Palestinians, all suggest that Israeli [forces] use lethal and potentially lethal force as a tool to control and repress Palestinians, rather than as the last resort to restore and maintain public order and civil life for the Palestinians.”Muhammad and his friends are believed to have run when they saw Israeli military vehicles in their vicinity, before Israeli soldiers began shooting.An initial statement from the Israeli military said that its forces were responding to suspects throwing rocks – although no local reports indicate that had happened, or that Muhammad and his friends were involved. Israeli media have since reported that a preliminary military investigation had found that the shooting “deviated from the rules of engagement”, and that there had been “improper use of weaponry”.Israeli soldiers rarely face repercussions for carrying out killings of Palestinians in the West Bank, with towns and villages like al-Rihiya instead left to pick up the pieces after tragedies like Muhammad’s death.The white robe he wore for Friday prayers still lies neatly folded beside his bed, next to a small bottle of perfume. His books are stacked where he left them.“This is where Muhammad slept,” Alia said, as she pointed to the empty space. “They killed his childhood.”His family are struggling to deal with Muhammad’s death in their own ways. Sila refuses to go back to school – her brother always walked alongside her.“Muhammad wasn’t just a brother, he was my friend,” she said. “When he came home from school, he would ask me to tutor him, and if I got busy, he would get angry and say ‘teach me first’. I was afraid of sleeping in the dark, so he would stay with me until I fell asleep, then he would go to sleep.”His father, Bahjat, finds himself walking by the bag and around the room, touching his bed, breathing in the scent of his clothes.“His passing left a huge void,” said Bahjat. “I see him in every corner of the house: at the dining table, in his study and the play area.”“I still can’t believe he’s gone,” Mais said. “I imagine him in heaven, playing, laughing, and having fun just like he used to. I still can’t believe he’s gone … and I never will.”","headline":"‘They killed his childhood’: West Bank family mourn child killed by Israel","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/25/they-killed-his-childhood-west-bank-family-mourn-child-killed-israel","message":"His mother, Alia, prepared his clothes and breakfast, and packed three extra slices of pizza for him to share with his friends, just like he’d asked.

But the triumph is unobjectionable, unquestionable.”Cordoba said Milei’s government appeared to have secured the one-third of seats it needs in the Chamber of Deputies to prevent any future presidential vetoes from being overturned by Congress. In the last few months, the opposition had overturned several Milei vetoes of spending bills he had said threatened the country’s fiscal balance.“The result is better than even the most optimistic Milei supporters were hoping for,” said Marcelo Garcia, Americas director of risk consultancy Horizon Engage.“With this result, Milei will be able to easily defend his decrees and vetoes in Congress,” Garcia said, adding that allies will have more of an incentive to support a winning president.Indeed, in his celebratory speech, Milei suggested a deeper willingness to form partnerships, saying “there are dozens of deputies and senators from other parties with whom we can reach basic agreements.”Maria Laura Tagina, a political scientist at the Universidad Nacional de San Martin, said that while Milei’s approval rating had suffered from fatigue over austerity measures and corruption scandals, it was possible disillusioned Argentines decided to stay home. Voter turnout was around 68%, the lowest in more than a decade, media outlets reported.Milei has said he expects a cabinet shake-up after the election that could include members of the centrist PRO party, a frequent ally of the government in Congress led by former President Mauricio Macri.Bonds and stocks are expected to rally on Monday when markets open, as the result gives Milei the votes and political capital needed to accelerate his reforms.Many analysts also predicted there would be a devaluation of the peso, which they say has been overvalued to contain inflation.","headline":"Victory for Milei’s party in Argentina midterms seen as test for his austerity cuts and Trump support","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/26/americas/argentina-midterm-milei-latam-intl","message":"Argentine President Javier Milei’s party cruised to victory in midterm legislative elections as voters handed him a mandate to keep pushing through his radical overhaul of the economy despite widespread discontent with his deep austerity measures.

Limited civic space and low voter engagement further weaken inclusiveness,\" said political analyst Nicodemus Minde in a recent report for the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank.\"We do not have an election without a strong opposition. The electoral system is not independent. We already know who will win. I can't waste time to vote,\" he told the BBC. \"If the electoral commission was really independent, I would have voted.\"This is in stark contrast to the buzzing campaign on Tanzania's semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar - from where President Samia originally hails.The islanders elect their own regional president and incumbent Hussein Mwinyi of the CCM is seeking another term, but faces stiff competition from ACT-Wazalendo's Othman Masoud - who has been serving as his deputy in a unity administration.On the campaign trail on the mainland, President Samia has capitalised on the initial praise she received for her motherly approach - seeking to govern through dialogue rather than decree.This earned her the nickname \"Mama Samia\" - and at her rallies she has been promising to bring widespread development through better infrastructure, health and education.\"She brings dignity, we young women look up to her. We feel her presence as the president and that gives us confidence that we can be reliable to our communities now and in the future,\" first-time voter Queen Castoric from the northern city of Tanga told the BBC.But some women in urban areas, like Celina Ponsiana, who will also be casting her ballot for the first time in Dar es Salaam, are more equivocal: \"Leadership isn't only about tone.\"I believe the president has a task to do, first on unemployment. She has been supporting some but many still need help,\" she said.Another young woman in Morogoro, near Dar es Salaam, said she supported the president but refused to give her name to the BBC in case she faced a backlash from her contemporaries.\"Samia made us believe women can lead. I would love to say more, but many youth don't talk positively about her,\" she said.And while some give credit to President Samia for stabilising the economy, in some quarters there is even nostalgia for Magufuli given the rising reports of corruption.In a traditionally male-dominated society, she has faced problems asserting her authority. At recent rallies she has been reminding voters who is boss: \"Don't forget I am chief of the defence forces.\"She may also feel undermined by colleagues. Within the CCM, there was some opposition to the fact that she became the party's presidential candidate unchallenged.One senior party member who criticised her automatic candidacy - Humphrey Polepole - has since been abducted in mysterious circumstances.There is also a suggestion that she has in fact become the pawn of a powerful network of business tycoons and other influential CCM backers, known colloquially as Mtandao, according to Mr Minde in his ISS report.\"Internal [CCM] party democracy has been stifled through an orchestrated move to make President Samia the sole candidate. While this has deepened divisions within the party, a façade of unity is being presented to the public,\" he said.It is believed that Magufuli refused to take orders from the Mtandao, preferring to stick to his own anti-corruption agenda.Mr Minde warns that this has all contributed to a prevailing sense of fear in the East African nation. With the self-censorship of the media and the shrinking of political discourse, public debate has retreated to private conversations and social media.Analysts warn that such detachment, especially among young people, could hollow out Tanzania's democracy further - and create problems down the road for President Samia should there not be a big turnout and if protests kick off.The fall of el-Fasher would cement the RSF's control of the west and reinforces a de facto split in the nation.The education minister says the movement of staff and students has been affected by the scarcity of fuel.The fall of el-Fasher would cement the RSF's control of the west and reinforces a de facto split in the nation.","headline":"A coronation not a contest - Tanzania's first female president faces little opposition","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev1drlz0x0o","message":"With no heavyweight opposition candidates cleared to compete in Wednesday's election, many Tanzanians feel the vote is less like a contest and more like a coronation for President Samia Suluhu Hassan, as she faces her first presidential election.

But will scandals scuttle his goals?Buenos Aires, Argentina – A string of high-level scandals, coupled with a stalling economy and eroding approval ratings, are threatening President Javier Milei’s hopes for Argentina's midterm elections.Currently, both chambers are controlled by the left-wing and centrist opposition to Milei's far-right party, La Libertad Avanza.“The government is looking to get a third of Congress to build a ‘legislative shield,'\" said Andres Malamud, a senior research fellow at the University of Lisbon's Institute of Social Sciences.That number of seats, Malamud explained, will prevent the opposition from forming a supermajority to override Milei's vetoes.It would also allow for Milei \"to govern without a majority, for his decrees not to be challenged, and protect him from a potential impeachment in the future\".Experts say the midterms will serve as a de facto referendum on the first half of Milei’s four-year term, which has seen Argentina's sky-high inflation stabilise at the expense of public spending.“So far, he has been able to govern thanks to the public’s support, from people who were struggling but believed he could change things — that the future was going to be better,\" Malamud said.\"But the challenge now is that things are not better, so the question is whether those who supported him before will go and vote for his candidates.”But Malamud explained that the challenge for Milei is that he has been unable to form strong coalitions.A self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalist and an economist by profession, Milei had campaigned on his status as an outsider, denouncing career politicians as a \"caste\" of thieves.He has also made good on his pledge to take a \"chainsaw\" to the federal government. As president, he has cut spending on healthcare, education, social services and public infrastructure in order to achieve a fiscal surplus.While his administration has managed to lower inflation, his economic plan saw the Argentinian peso appreciate, which has stalled salary growth.Against this backdrop, the race to amass seats in Congress has been challenging for Milei, even when faced with Argentina's fractured left.Malamud believes that, if Milei delivers on his promises of economic recovery, other elements of his platform, including his austerity measures, might seem more palatable.“If Milei manages to keep inflation low — and for that, he needs money — he will have the space to push forward on other aspects of his political agenda,\" Malamud said.But gaining support has proven difficult, as a series of high-level scandals has taken a toll on the approval ratings for both Milei and his party.On October 6, for instance, a leading Milei-backed candidate, Jose Luis Espert, suspended his campaign after he was charged with money laundering.Until those allegations came to light, Espert had been a leading contender to represent the province of Buenos Aires in the Chamber of Deputies.Milei has denounced the accusations as a \"malicious operation\" to \"smear\" the candidate, and Espert himself has denied any wrongdoing.A few weeks earlier, leaked audio captured Diego Spagnuolo, the former head of Argentina’s National Disability Agency, accusing the president's sister, Karina Milei, of requesting kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies.Milei, who appointed his sister as secretary-general to the presidency, has likewise rejected those accusations.He called the leaked audio part of an “orchestrated and planned disinformation campaign” aimed at “maliciously influencing the electoral process”.In the wake of the scandal, however, Argentina's Congress delivered high-profile rebukes to Milei's platform.It overrode Milei's veto for the first time in September to defend disability spending. Then, in October, it rejected Milei's veto again to preserve increases to education and healthcare funding.The controversies and legislative hurdles have slowed La Libertad Avanza's momentum going into the midterms, according to Carolina Barry, a political science researcher and co-editor of the Historical Dictionary of Peronism.“The government is facing this race in a state of considerable uncertainty, thanks to the many setbacks it has suffered in Congress and the accusations affecting the party,” Barry said.Experts also point to last month's provincial-level elections in Buenos Aires as a bellwether for the midterms: La Fuerza Patria came out ahead in that race as well.Those efforts were aimed at giving Milei a boost ahead of the midterm race, a fact Trump himself admitted.But in doing so, Trump warned that the economic lifeline was contingent upon Milei's success at the ballot box.Trump's threat sent the value of the Argentinian peso tumbling, after a brief rally following the news of the currency swap.“Trump is supporting Milei, but then he says something else, and that is generating a lot of questions and uncertainty,” said Barry. \"None of that is helping Milei at home.\"She believes it is likely that La Libertad Avanza will pick up some seats in the midterm election, but not enough to push through Milei's reforms without coalition-building.Mariana Heredia, a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), acknowledged that Trump's support for Milei has generated controversy, with some perceiving it as election interference.But, she said, Trump is unlikely to have the same influence over voters as the biggest factor in the race: the economy.“The government is heading into the election weakened because, unlike last year when it managed to combine stabilisation with a modest economic rebound, this year the effects of the austerity measures are being felt much more strongly across a range of sectors,\" Heredia said.\"The economy is stagnant, and the only sectors showing any momentum or dynamism are mining and oil — which have very little spillover effect on urban populations, who make up the majority of voters.”Malamud likewise expects the success of Milei's party to hinge upon the economy — and market fluctuations could spell disappointment.","headline":"High stakes for Javier Milei as midterm elections loom in Argentina","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/24/high-stakes-for-javier-milei-as-midterm-elections-loom-in-argentina","message":"The midterm elections are set to serve as a referendum on President Milei's economic policy.

As travelers often do, he asked her where she was traveling from. But when she said she was from Vancouver, the conversation took an unexpected turn.Immediately, the man eyed her with suspicion. He accused her of lying, to the horror of his daughter who urged him to stop giving Shankar the third-degree.“He just didn’t believe me when I said I was traveling from Canada,” Shankar said. “So I was like, ‘Do you want to see my passport? How do you want to do this?’”“I do think his doubt did stem a little bit from a lot of Americans out there trying to pass themselves off as Canadians,” she added.Moreover, one of the most common arguments online against flag jacking is that they’re not fooling anyone: Americans are easily distinguishable from Canadians, many say, no matter how many maple leaf flags they’re wearing.Aside from how people measure temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit), heavy regional accents (French-Canadian or American Southern, for example), and answers to a flash quiz asking “What’s the capital city of Canada?” (answer: Ottawa) and “How do you pronounce Toronto?” (Torontonians don’t pronounce the second ‘t’) — can the world really tell Americans and Canadians apart?Several European tour guides who work with Americans and Canadians responded with a resounding “yes.”“We use them because many of them are true. And it’s not just Americans, it’s for everybody. Every nation has its own little quirks, that’s how we recognize each other.”And when it comes to Americans, one of the easiest ways to spot an American abroad is that you hear them before you see them, she says.“Canadians don’t stand out as much as Americans. In conversation, they’re more subtle, you don’t hear them from two tables down.”Canadians abroad often prefer to disclose their origin directly. As the joke goes, how can you tell a person is from Canada? They’ll tell you.“Canadians will identify themselves as Canadian right away,” points out Parisian Bertrand d’Aleman, founder of My Private Paris tours. Other tour guides agreed, believing Canadians do this to avoid being confused with their American counterparts.There is little academic research that examines the differences between American and Canadian tourists abroad, according to Kim Dae-young, professor of hospitality management at the University of Missouri.But his own research offers insight into how a tourist’s nationality, sense of entitlement and perceived social status affect their interactions with a destination.“The findings consistently show that a traveler’s nationality can significantly influence their behavior abroad,” he tells CNN. “When individuals visit a destination they perceive as more advanced than their home country, they are less likely to engage in misbehavior. The same individuals tend to display more misbehavior when they travel to a country they perceive as less advanced.”For his research, Kim conducted surveys among Americans who were asked to imagine their travels in France, which was perceived to be a more advanced destination, and Thailand, which they considered to be less developed. His research revealed that Americans were more likely to litter, vandalize or wear inappropriate clothing in Thailand than in France.Yet while there’s little scientific study, travel professionals have plenty of other observations about the differences in travelers from the US and Canada.Australian Leigh Barnes, president of the Americas region at tour company Intrepid Travel, says Canadians tend to be adventurous and freewheeling, open to new activities and spontaneity, while Americans tend to favor structure and organization.Likewise, Canadians are less likely to complain openly if they’re unhappy with something and brood quietly, while Americans are much more vocal if something doesn’t meet their standards, Barnes adds.“The Americans are a bit louder, ask more questions and are more direct,” he says. “Canadians don’t vocalize if they’re unhappy. And both of those can be pros and cons.”But real differences begin to emerge as conversations deepen –- subtle cues in attitudes and behavior that shed light on the cultural differences between the two countries.In separate interviews, Podhrazska and d’Aleman agreed that Canadians tend to have a broader understanding of European history and current affairs than American travelers, owing to their own historical connection with Europe as a Commonwealth country, and their French-Canadian heritage.Another giveaway that a tourist is American? “US travelers are obsessed with ‘skip the line,’” says Podhrazska. It’s one of the most common requests among her affluent American clients, she says, who are willing to shell out more to move to the front of the line at tourist attractions.“I blame Disney for this,” she says half-jokingly, referring to the theme park’s expedited access passes (currently called Lightning Lane passes), which create a tiered system of elite versus regular visitors. But by and large, the concept doesn’t exist in London, she says, forcing her to manage expectations among her American clients.“Everyone has to go through the security queue and do what everybody else does. There’s no special treatment.”Briton Charley Harrison, founder of the London-based Totally Tailored Tours, also cautions American tourists against assuming that American culture is the default yardstick by which the world is measured. Among her US clients, that’s manifested in the past through their assumption that they can pay abroad with US dollars, or their insistence that the British have an accent – and that they, Americans, do not.“You expect immigrants coming to the US to speak English. You’re on their turf here,” Jaso recalls telling her friend.Reynolds’ offers a broader overview about the differences between Canadian and American travelers abroad, first with a disclaimer, then with a weather analogy.“Canada’s got jerks. We’ve got a lot of jerks,” he tells CNN. “But on the whole, I think that Canadians generally try to find the best for the group, whereas Americans are very much for the individual.”That might mean going to the back of the line instead of trying to find a shortcut, and waiting for their turn. Because Canadians value order, he says.And though it may sound like a glib explanation at first, Reynolds offers up a simple hypothesis that reduces this cultural trait down to one thing: weather.“I think the collectivist attitude comes down to the environment,” says Reynolds, who lives in Stratford, in southwestern Ontario. “Canadian winters can be life or death sometimes and everyone needs to get their car pushed out of a snowbank every now and then. Everyone needs to shovel someone else’s driveway.”For Shankar, the dual US-Canadian citizen, differences between Canadians and Americans lie in the way they “hold space” in a conversation and in public.“In the US, we’re raised to be confident, and you move through life with that confidence. So Americans tend to be a little more bold. And I think their most redeeming quality is that they can be a unique, authentic version of themselves … the culture there supports being loud, unique and individualistic.”Canadians, on the other hand, are more collectivist, able to blend in, she adds, and adapt to different cultural spaces, a mindset she identifies with.Along with evading anti-American sentiment, flag-jacking Americans say they lie because they’re led to believe they’ll be treated better as Canadians abroad.“It’s more about the behavior that you’re modeling, as opposed to where you’re from,” Barnes of Intrepid says. “If you’re respectful of the local customs and culture, you’re curious and courteous, you’re going to have an amazing holiday.”","headline":"Are American tourists easily distinguishable from Canadians?

Ukraine has balked at this, and Trump has failed to move either side.Here is what the current front lines look like and how Russia and Ukraine have reacted to this latest proposal:“They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.When Trump was asked if he had advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cede the whole of the eastern region of Donbas, which borders Russia and which it has laid claim to, he said no.“Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now. I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia,” Trump told a reporter from the Reuters news agency.Over the course of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, Russia has seized territory primarily in four eastern and southern Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. It also controls a small pocket of Kharkiv province.Russia controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk, including the areas around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.Zaporizhia is a significant industrial region known for its steel, aluminium and aircraft manufacturing and is also home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.On Tuesday, European leaders and Zelenskyy signed a statement saying they “strongly” support Trump’s proposal.Previously, Ukraine has insisted on reclaiming all of its land. But Trump has flip-flopped over whether Ukraine should or should not be required to cede land to Russia in any peace deal.In August before a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war, Trump stated that both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war.On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to “a long-term, sustainable peace – not an immediate ceasefire that would lead nowhere”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added that “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change,” referring to its hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Russia had sent a private communique to the US over the weekend, demanding control of all of the Donbas – not just the parts it has already seized.A planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, in the next two weeks was shelved this week as Trump said he did not want a “wasted meeting” with Putin.“It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get, so I cancelled it. But we’ll do it in the future,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday.","headline":"Trump wants to ‘freeze’ Russia-Ukraine war: Who gets what if that happens?","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/trump-wants-to-freeze-russia-ukraine-war-who-gets-what-if-that-happens","message":"United States President Donald Trump has suggested freezing the war in Ukraine at its current front lines and using these lines as a starting point for future negotiations over territory.

Escalating trade tensions also have an impact.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents the UK's major supermarkets, said retailers were \"doing everything possible to keep food prices affordable\".The chancellor has previously said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in her budget, though on Friday she refused to rule out raising income tax, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.Supermarket bosses highlighted that part of the government's business rates reforms posed a problem for the industry, in particular the so-called business rates surtax, which is being levied on all large commercial premises.But the UK's supermarkets have argued large retail premises were a \"tiny proportion of all stores, yet account for a third of retail's total business rates\".They urged the chancellor to \"ensure that the proposed changes to business rates result in a significant reduction to the industry's rates burden\".\"The chancellor has rightly made tackling inflation her top priority, and with food inflation stubbornly high, ensuring retail's rates burden doesn't rise further would be one of the simplest ways to help,\" said Ms Dickinson.The Treasury said that business rates would be adjusted to reflect changes in the overall value of the tax base, \"so that the system continues to raise the same amount of revenue in real terms\".\"If the total value of rateable properties increases, the tax rate will generally fall,\" it added. \"This means that even if a specific property's RV goes up, its bill could still decrease if the reduction in the tax rate is large enough to offset the increase in value.\"Ultimately, what businesses pay after a revaluation depends on both the new RVs and the adjusted tax rate.\"Chancellors rarely reveal tax plans before the Budget, but Reeves has softened her language on raising income tax.Frances Boyd says she is now weighing up offers of paid work from Waitrose and Asda for her son Tom.","headline":"Tax rises could push UK food prices higher, warn supermarkets","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620gy43pe4o","message":"The bosses of Britain's biggest supermarkets have warned food prices could rise even further if higher taxes are imposed on the sector.

The Netherlands has always had a coalition government formed by a minimum of two parties due to its proportional representation electoral system, under which seats in parliament are awarded to parties in proportion to the number of votes they win.But in June, PVV made a dramatic exit from the coalition government over a disagreement on immigration policy. PVV had wanted to introduce a stricter asylum policy that included closing borders to new asylum seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes, but the other parties demanded further discussions.In a dramatic move, Wilders took to X to announce that the failure by other parties to agree to PVV’s plans meant it would leave the coalition.Coalition partners slammed this decision and accused Wilders of being driven by self-interest. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said at the time that Wilders “chooses his own ego and his own interests. I am astonished. He throws away the chance for a right-wing policy”.Following the pull-out, Prime Minister Dick Schoof – an independent – announced that he would resign and a snap election would be held this month.Then, in August, the NSC’s Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp also resigned after he failed to secure support for new sanctions against Israel over its war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in Gaza City. In solidarity with Veldkamp, other NSC party members left the coalition, leaving only two parties remaining.While left-wingers argue that the immigration issue has been wildly hyped up by the far right, they are losing control of the narrative.Esme Smithson Swain, a member of MiGreat, a Dutch non-governmental campaign group that calls for freedom of movement and equal treatment for migrants in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera that the far right in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, more widely, had “constructed a narrative that there is a migration crisis”.“They’ve managed to construct this idea of a crisis, and that distracts our attention away from populism, away from arms trades, away from social services and the welfare state being sold off.”Mark van Ostaijen, an associate professor in public administration and sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, explained that immigration has become a mainstream talking point in “housing, care, educational and cultural policy domains”.“I think this is indeed something that will continue the electoral legitimacy of far-right parties, or right-wing parties, even more, given the fact that the Netherlands was already quite leaning towards the conservative angle,” van Ostaijen told Al Jazeera.“This will be a topic that will haunt our politics and our democratic decision-making and discourse for quite a while,” he said.Anecdotal evidence bears this out. Fakir has noticed a change in the experiences of immigrant residents she and her colleagues have spoken to in the country following the growth of the PVV.“In their personal life [they have seen] a noticeable shift where people feel more free or emboldened to express racist views, both online and in real life. Others are telling them those classic things of ‘go back to your own country, or you’re not Dutch’,” she said.For Nassreddin Taibi, a recent graduate who works as a political analyst and plans to vote for GroenLinks-PvdA, the anti-immigration protests at the Hague “further cemented polarisation among Dutch voters” and have caused centrist parties to fall into line with the right-wing narrative.“These protests have influenced the discourse in the sense that centrist parties now say that cutting immigration is necessary to win back trust of voters in politics,” he said.While the far-right PVV is projected to win the most seats in this election, it will still face an uphill journey to form a government, as other parties such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have ruled out joining a coalition government.Furthermore, the PVV’s leader, Wilders, has not escaped controversy with his Islamophobic comments and anti-migration stance despite the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the country as a whole.In another, a white woman is seen in a supermarket paying for groceries while surrounded by Muslim women wearing hijabs and niqabs, with the caption: “No mass immigration, no Islamisation, no backwardness of the Dutch.” The post received 885 likes.While the outgoing home affairs minister, Judith Uitermark, has said the government is examining new ways to combat fake news, she added that the Netherlands is somewhat protected from the rise of extremism by its proportional representation system, under which no one party ever wins a majority.Still, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has warned voters not to use AI chatbots to help them decide who to vote for.And a large number are still deciding. EenVandaag found that some 48 percent of voters are still undecided about which candidate they will choose. If the GroenLinks-PvdA can disengage from right-wing talking points and, instead, focus on its own policies more, it may perform better than expected, analysts say.“We find ourselves doing this also as a civil society organisation, as campaigners, trying to fight off the narrative and fight off the kind of populist ideals of the far right faster than we can push for our own agenda as well. And I think a lot of the time that leaves left-wing parties in the Netherlands seeming a bit hollow,” Swain said.Still, she says that she is holding out hope for this election, despite what feels like a “vast and growing far-right bulk of the population”.“I think it’s very easy to kind of feel that division between ‘us and them’. Us campaigning on the left and this growing mass of the far right,” Swain said.“We need to tackle fighting the influence of lobbying and of fake news in our political structures. And I think that becoming more united as a population would naturally fall from that.”","headline":"Dutch voters hit polls as immigration fears propel far right towards power","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/dutch-voters-hit-polls-as-immigration-fears-propel-far-right-towards-power","message":"An outright win is next to impossible.

Or, a visit to Chance In Hell SnoBalls, where icy confections come in wild flavors like dill pickle, ube or root beer.Petite Clouet is pale yellow. The SnoBall shop is painted electric pink. You can’t escape color and creativity here, be it literal or figurative. In a colorful, creative city, the Bywater stands out.It’s home to growing pains, too. Like many cool districts, it got discovered. The working-class hideaway has been gentrified, in parts.The Bywater was a predominantly African American, family neighborhood prior to Hurricane Katrina. Rents have since risen. Airbnb exploded here, for a time draining affordable houses for permanent residents before short-term rental restrictions arrived. There are major property developments now threatening to change this storied neighborhood –– some argue for better; some for worse.For now, Bywater remains a walkable, wonderful, idiosyncratic New Orleans neighborhood, worth visiting and supporting.If you want a true tour, Glennis Waterman is a local guide, volunteering with Friends of the Cabildo, a non-profit supporting the Louisiana State Museum.Blight became jogging paths, a dog run, native foliage and event spaces –– all with uninterrupted Mississippi River views.One park access point is a massive bridge at Piety Street. “We used a naturally rusting material for it, symbolizing the industrial history here,” Rivera says. “You see old timber posts in the water from the bridge. Those once supported the wharf sheds. We left them to preserve the past.”Preserving history is something New Orleanians, in particular, relish. On Bywater’s eastern edge, at Kentucky Street, Lucullus Antiques is a must-visit.“Like Bywater itself, our shop is a destination. We want intrepid travelers, not tourists,” he says wryly, “… those adventuring for something special. With my passions for history and aesthetics, I love Bywater’s vibe of an eccentric and colorful small village.”You’ll see two of Odums’ most recognizable murals, thirty feet high, on the warehouse exterior walls, next to the train tracks at Homer Plessy Way –– a corridor named for Louisiana’s famous shoemaker and Black activist.“The Black Boy and Black Girl are really billboards to announce this neighborhood,” Odums says. “I wanted to make sure that the history here is not erased. A predominantly Black neighborhood at one point, families had generations here. It’s always been an area for creatives. As the demographics change, we want to keep Bywater sustainable.”To be a traveler, rather than a tourist, as Patrick Dunne so aptly put it, supporting independent businesses is vital. It’s also easy and entertaining.You can’t discuss creativity without mentioning culinary arts. For this, the scene skews international, and ardently experimental.French dishes get dashes of Japanese flair at N7, a dreamy European courtyard hidden behind a tall privacy fence. Strings of marquee bulbs hang from live oaks and camping lanterns dot the tables.Across the road, Sneaky Pickle’s vegan/vegetarian standouts include cardamom cold brew, black-rice eggrolls and smoked tempeh Reubens. At night, the space becomes Bar Brine and meat returns to the menu — from rare tuna with yuzu to a killer, six-ounce cheeseburger.Like the art and the architecture, the longstanding establishments proffer flavor, but they also foster deep community connection.Bywater Bakery has live-music sets outside on weekends, and hot coffee and buttery pastries are available every morning.The Joint smokes the barbecue out back. While the pulled pork plate is worth a sit-down, they do have a quirky perk. They sell single ribs, falling off the bone, to-go.“We like to keep the local lore,” says Frady. “Red Beans & Rice traditional, every Monday. Tuesday is Meatloaf Day … my grandmother’s recipe … and Fridays, fried catfish.”“I’ve certainly watched this neighborhood change but never imagined it as a tourist destination. My dad ran tabs for struggling families, back when the area was rough and grandmothers hid money in their bras,” Kirk Frady says with a laugh. “Dad used to tell customers, ‘If you make a wish on your first po-boy, it will come true.’”","headline":"In colorful, creative New Orleans, this neighborhood stands out","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/bywater-neighborhood-guide-new-orleans","message":"– If you meet a local to hang out in the Bywater, they might suggest a matcha latte at Petite Clouet Café.

Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.Dr Rebecca Inglis, of HWW, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”Amnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.Despite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.Since his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.At least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.The table below lists more information about the 95 healthcare workers still held captive by Israel.","headline":"Who are the 95 Palestinian medics held captive by Israel?","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/who-are-the-95-palestinian-healthcare-workers-held-captive-by-israel","message":"More doctors and healthcare professionals are mobilising and calling for action to demand the release of Dr Hussam Abu Safia and at least 94 other Palestinian medics currently held captive by Israeli authorities.

People call them set-piece FC and all that,\" former City defender Nedum Onouha told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"But they are up there with teams with the most shots in the Premier League and had the fewest goals conceded, conceded the fewest chances and the fewest shots.But the business has so far paid off in style, with his side second top scorers in the league and having the tightest defence, despite a number of injuries.\"Arsenal can do a bit of everything now. The whole team has a fear factor.\" former Gunners striker Theo Walcott added on BBC Sport. \"People are just afraid of them and it is great to see.\"It's starting to now be normal that they don't concede goals. They will have a bad patch and last year it was too many draws, but I don't think that's going to happen this year. There is belief in the whole club now.\"Ex-Arsenal and England striker Ellen White described Arteta's men as a \"juggernaut, looking difficult to stop\".Arsenal's defensive solidity is a key reason why they are looking well positioned to finally fulfil their title target.Arteta himself said he valued the win over Palace more \"than any other victory this season\", and with Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City losing, Arsenal had \"a big opportunity as well with the things that happened during this weekend\".\"We are where we are [in the league] and it is a credit to us because we've been very, very consistent, but it really doesn't mean anything other than let's keep doing a lot of things that we're doing really well,\" he added.They restricted Palace to just one shot on target and even that opportunity was when the ball flicked off of Eddie Nketiah's head and into keeper David Raya's hands.The central defensive pairing of Gabriel and William Saliba is arguably the best in the league and Arsenal have kept a clean sheet in six of their first nine games, more than any other team this season.\"The pattern for Arsenal is that they can play anyone and get results. The champions of old don't concede many goals and Arsenal have belief they'll make a chance and they'll take it.\" said Walcott.Their threat from set-pieces is well known, but opposition teams still don't know how to contain the Gunners from the opportunities they get.They have scored crucial goals in matches against Manchester United, Newcastle, Fulham and Atletico Madrid from set-pieces and those goals have seen them pick up vital wins, or Gabriel opened the scoring against Atletico when it looked like there was no way through.Opposing managers have highlighted Arsenal's quality from corners and free-kicks and, in Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice, they have two of the best takers in the league.Arsenal will hope to score more from open play, but having the highest ratio of goals from set-pieces at this stage, while being top, is no bad thing.","headline":"'People are afraid' - why 'juggernaut' Arsenal are team to beat","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn40lxq2j39o","message":"It is not hard to see why Arsenal are now many people's favourites to win the Premier League this season.

Seven of Real's previous eight managers lost their first La Liga meeting with Barcelona.After the laissez-faire, player-orientated approach of Carlo Ancelotti failed to get results last season, Alonso's positional game-model yielded its first major result.\"He got it spot on. Real Madrid were very good, and Barcelona didn't play well because of what Real Madrid were doing,\" Balague told BBC Sport.\"Without the ball they pressed high for as long as they could, and if they were beaten, they tracked back in an organised way, everybody including Vinicius.The new system looks to be good news for Bellingham, who last season was essentially asked to do everything in midfield and more.\"By using Eduardo Camavinga in central midfield, you get more dynamism and more ways to close down the channels,\" said Balague.\"That forced them to put Bellingham on the right-hand side. I'm sure he would have been asked to keep an eye on the runs of Mbappe when he had the ball and had space, and he found him a few times.\"He was asked to get into the box and be around the edge of the box, where he is very dangerous. He also came inside to close the inside channels and make Barcelona's life very difficult.\"There's no doubting that Madridistas love Vinicius, his name was chanted on several occasions by a fervent Bernabeu crowd.But there have been countless reports in recent months that Los Blancos would consider letting him leave if the right offer were to come in.Vinicius will have one year remaining on his contract come the end of the season, but talks over a new deal have stalled.\"Everyone will have a go at him and rightly so, because it showed a lack of respect for Rodrygo who replaced him,\" said Balague.\"That mentality is difficult to shake, especially when you feel close to being number one in the world, then the club drives the axis towards Mbappe [as the star].\"He feels all that, and when Alonso subbed him - fairly, because Vinicius stopped dropping back as he should - in Vinicius' head he says, 'why me, why me again?'.After winning all four of last season's Clasicos, Sunday's performance was emblematic of Barcelona's unconvincing start to the campaign.Injuries have robbed boss Hansi Flick of key players including Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Dani Olmo, and his system isn't working without them.\"It's like the whole team is a little bit less sharp without the ball, less hungry to recover it, less aggressive to get the possession back,\" added Balague.\"It's easier to attack them. If the defensive line is not perfect, as it wasn't on the Mbappe goal because Alejandro Balde played him onside, they are not helped by the midfield and forwards not closing down those on the ball as well as they should.\"\"Their stars weren't at their best. Lamine doesn't feel like he's in good form, perhaps he's suffering from groin problems that don't allow him to display his talent.\"The Barcelona of a year ago that caught Mbappe offside eight times, with Lewandowski, Raphinha and Lamine playing together, is gone at the moment.Marcus Rashford has been a shining light for Barcelona since joining on loan from Manchester United, but on Sunday he looked blunted.\"He was trying to create danger on the left-hand side, but he found himself too often on his own and he could not beat the Madrid defence,\" added Balague.","headline":"Real Madrid impress but Vinicius tension grows - Clasico talking points","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj97v1ll77po","message":"Jude Bellingham got his first league goal and assist of the season after a difficult few months recovering from shoulder surgery.

They are the top two players in that team and if their body language is not right, that affects everyone else.I might be wrong on this, but if I was a Liverpool fan or the manager, that would be a big concern for me.Analysing Liverpool's defeat on Match of the Day, former Premier League defender Ashley Williams said Liverpool's defending against Brentford was simply \"not good enough\" and resulted in an \"unacceptable\" goal for Kevin Schade.Liverpool head coach Arne Slot was in reflective mood as he spoke with BBC Match of the Day after Saturday's defeat to Brentford, describing it as a \"disappointing\" result and performance:\"Conceding three goals is far too much if you want to win a game of football. First one was a set-piece. Second is a counter-attack which is one of the things [Brentford] are really good at. We didn't defend that at all.\"On four defeats in a row: \"What I have to do is look at what we do wrong and what we do right. I have a clear idea of where we have to improve, but that hasn't been the case in other games. We didn't do the basics right.\"With their defeat to Brentford on Saturday, Liverpool became\nthe fourth defending Premier League champions to lose four matches in a row.The only team in Europe’s top five leagues that is on a worse\nlosing run than the Reds is Germany’s St Pauli, who have lost five on the spin\nin the Bundesliga.Liverpool are the first team in English top-flight history to win their opening five matches of a season and then lose their next four.The Reds have already lost as many Premier League games this season as they did in the entirety of last season (four).Villa could not buy a win in their opening matches but have now won four Premier League games in a row, while Liverpool won their opening five league matches but results have since nosedived - losing their next four.The defending champions' latest defeat - at Brentford - was potentially their most troubling, with serious flaws exposed in their defence and questions starting to be asked about manager Arne Slot's tactics.The beauty of football is the human element where a mistake or a piece of luck can alter the course of any match, so I wouldn't place any reliance on the predictions of an Opta 'super computer'. It is the unpredictability that makes the Premier League so compelling.Manchester City may have built up a head of steam going into Sunday's match at Aston Villa, but, then again, so had the hosts.Villa now look to have got the frustration of missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day of last season well and truly out of their system.Both Liverpool and Manchester City will be there as they have the squads and experience. A surprise package will also be there. Doubts about Arsenal centre on their mentality. Whoever stands up and wants it more will be the champion.City and Liverpool are the only teams that are able to challenge Arsenal, and they look like they are way behind than they would expect right now. The rest are fighting for scraps.It's true that the pressure cranks up in the title race in April, Henry, but dropped points before the turn of the year can leave teams with a mountain to climb.Games are coming thick and fast for Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City side, with domestic and European challenges piling up.The good news for City is they have four home matches in their next six - returning to Etihad Stadium this weekend to host high-flying Bournemouth in the Premier League after a midweek EFL Cup tie at Swansea.Yes they [Arsenal] probably will be [champions], but all this talk of title races being pushed by media is premature and just for clicks. Ask Pep, Klopp, Fergie. The title race starts in late March/April, before is putting yourself in a position to be in that race come April.On the fitness of Erling Haaland after the Norway striker collided with a post at Villa Park, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola did little to quell concern in his post-match interview with the BBC.The Norway striker failed to score in only his second game for club and country this season and thought he had claimed a dramatic late leveller, only for the offside flag to go up against Omar Marmoush who crossed low for Haaland to squeeze a finish over the line.There was concern when he collided heavily with the post following his disallowed effort and City can ill-afford to have their star man ruled out for any period of time.Are Liverpool and Manchester City still Arsenal's main challengers? No, because neither of them are in second place. We need to stop disrespecting \"smaller\" teams who are high up the table on merit. If Liverpool and City want to be called challengers, they need to start winning games. Simple as that.Manchester City had started to gather momentum after recovering from back-to-back defeats - to Tottenham and Brighton - in the opening month of their season.Three consecutive wins followed - against Burnley, Brentford and Everton - before they suffered their third defeat of the season at Aston Villa.Aston Villa's impressive home record was not lost on manager Unai Emery in his post-match comments to BBC's Match of the Day:\"Our fortress. Villa Park. We are feeling here so, so good. The positive energy to us was fantastic. We needed to show our wishes and commitment, and our capacity to play.\"I think everything trying to get together, the positive energy, the quality of the players, the tactics that we did and the effort.

Public outrage has been piling up over the sudden demolition to make way for the sprawling, golden ballroom he has long craved. Trump says the new construction will be a monument to the country’s greatness, even as his team insists there is nothing unusual in how he is going about it.“Nearly every single president who has lived in this beautiful White House … has made modernizations and renovations of their own,” insists White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.Author Kate Andersen Brower, who has written extensively about The People’s House, agrees with that foundational claim, but also points out a big difference this time: “We have never seen a wrecking ball taken to an entire wing.”Never mind that Trump has dismissed the East Wing as “a very small building” that was “never thought of as being much.” Brower and plenty of others saw it as a treasure. “I certainly had a lot of reverence for it because it was the first lady’s domain. It’s the only place she has to really call her own,” she said.“So in a sense,” Brower says, “it’s always been a bit of an afterthought, and some people within the White House call it Siberia because … you always want to be as close to the West Wing and the Oval Office as possible, and the East Wing is obviously removed.”Accordingly, the East Wing has always been considered a seat of soft power — more about social events than the political punch-ups in the West Wing.Outside the East Wing windows, Jackie Kennedy once doted over a green expanse of grass bordered with blooming plants and crowned by a pergola drawn up by Chinese American architect I.M. Pei — who would later design the stunning glass pyramid atop the entrance to the Louvre Museum in Paris. Separate from the Rose Garden, which has now been paved over by Trump, and christened the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden by her successor, Lady Bird Johnson, the space hosted weddings, receptions and other events.The East Wing is also where first lady Melania Trump erected those red Christmas trees in her husband’s first term.Brower notes of the East Wing, “If you were going to a Christmas party, that’s where you would enter. It was a beautiful space — gorgeous portraits lining the walls of first ladies over the years.”To be sure, those closest to Trump do not seem broken up by the destruction of the East Wing. The president had already left a distinct mark on the space by hanging a glaring picture of his face overlaid with an American flag pattern between the portraits of Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton.He insists private donors will pay for it all. But that won’t keep some longtime admirers of the East Wing from mourning a legacy they say no money could ever buy.","headline":"The White House’s East Wing is now demolished.

It is their full-time job.\"After following the suspect for a while at a distance he leaves the station without attempting a snatch. The officers are then called to look for another potential snatcher seen in the area.BTP officers are often patrolling the transport network undercover, particularly around known hotspot areas like Finsbury Park.\"They're doing it on an industrial level - to make a lot of money,\" the officer said, adding many thieves fly into the UK from abroad, spend a few weeks in the UK to steal, before moving on.Hadush Kebatu is back in custody following a two-day manhunt after his mistaken release from prison.","headline":"'I watched my stolen phone head to London, Dubai and China'","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620zw40xryo","message":"It happens in a heartbeat.

Smartphones often do this automatically.Earlier this year, a woman in North Carolina told the WBTV news outlet her iCloud account was hacked and her password changed. She lost access to her photos and videos and said Apple told her there was nothing they could do about it.You don't have to be hacked though. If you're really unlucky you might forget your password and be unable to restore it - meaning you can't log back into your cloud service.\"A lot of people use social media almost like a diary. Social media platforms are set up to sort of serialise people's lives and [create] narratives,\" says Dr Esperanza Miyake of the University of Strathclyde, who researches how social media companies treat people's data.There can be a cost issue, too. Earlier this month Snapchat announced it would start charging people for storing photos and videos on their messaging app, much to the annoyance of some users.Prof Jane Winters, a digital humanities specialist from the University of London, suggests there will always be a problem with treating commercial platforms as archives. \"They don't have an archival function. They're commercial entities.\"The assumption that we will always be able to keep uploading every single photo we take and have it preserved in perpetuity by a commercial entity is one that's going to be tested.\"This is why downloading photos and keeping them on an external device like a hard drive or memory card is a good idea.You shouldn't have to worry about images becoming unreadable for a very long time - thanks to \"robust\" image file formats like jpeg, according to Prof Winters.If you've got your three copies of your photos, you're in a good place. But what about printing them out?Despite the risks of fire, water damage, or simply being misplaced, it's still a genuinely durable way of passing down memories through the generations.Dr Barnatt and Dr Miyake say people who grew up with social media and mobile phones should keep offline copies of their most beloved items.If you start thinking about printing out your digital archive too late in life, \"you may have lost the things you value already\".Some archivists and futurists see this return to print as a way to counter a \"digital dark age\" - the idea that photos, videos and text might become unreadable as technology changes.But Prof Winters thinks those claims are overblown, pointing to major international efforts to preserve more and more digital and online internet.Thendo says there is a particular joy people share when looking through a photo album together and chatting.\"You can't really do that on your phone,\" Thendo says. \"Sure, you can open up your iCloud or whatever and scroll through all your photos, but you're going to find a lot of random pictures.\"As opposed to a photo album where you would have the perfect picture that you have picked and put in there - that's the difference.\"Platforms, including Open AI's Sora, have gone viral due to their ability to make hyper-realistic videos.","headline":"I lost thousands of photos when my phone crashed.

The existence of a Venezuelan government-run “Cartel de los Soles”, let alone its control of the transnational cocaine trade from Venezuela, has been largely debunked. And while “Tren de Aragua” is a real criminal organisation with a transnational presence, it lacks the capacity to operate in the ways suggested by the United States; it certainly pales in comparison to the power of cartels in Colombia, Mexico, or Ecuador.At first, the US display of force off the coast of Venezuela appeared to be an exercise in political theatre: an attempt by President Trump to project his “tough on crime” approach to domestic — including eager MAGA — audiences. “If you traffic in drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last week. Recent polls show that crime remains one of Americans’ primary concerns.Another reading was that Trump’s build-up was a political stunt designed to appease the neo-cons in his administration, sectors of Washington’s foreign policy establishment, and radical elements of the Venezuelan opposition, including Maria Corina Machado, the new Nobel Laureate and hardline opposition leader who has called for foreign intervention in her own country. Unlike more moderate Venezuelan opposition leaders, these actors are all hostile to any perceived normalisation with Venezuela and oppose Trump’s recent granting of an operating licence to Chevron. The build-up appeared, in this light, as a typical Trumpian bluff: projecting toughness towards Maduro while simultaneously securing Venezuela’s oil.One potential scenario is that the rhetorical escalation of the last few weeks will not be matched by direct attacks on Venezuela, and that the United States’s extrajudicial killings in the Caribbean will simply continue as they have over the last month and a half. In the absence of any serious US drug policy — especially on the vital issues of consumption or money laundering — the satellite imagery of small boats being blown up in the Caribbean serves Trump’s agenda well, albeit with tragic consequences for the boats’ unidentified occupants and their families.But today, the sheer scale of the US military build-up does not align with the idea of a cynical political stunt, nor does Trump’s decision to cut off all diplomatic backchannels with the Venezuelan government and deauthorise special envoy Rick Grenell’s outreach to Maduro. The more we look at the military deployment and the increasingly belligerent rhetoric from Trump officials, the more the pursuit of regime change through military means appears to be the most plausible explanation.Rubio and his fellow Florida Republicans have, of course, been ardently advocating for a more aggressive approach towards Venezuela for years. For Rubio, toppling the Venezuelan president — and perhaps, if he can ride the momentum, even overthrowing the Communist Party in Cuba — is a generational objective, more symbolic than strategic, and rooted in political passions and fantasies of return and revenge.It’s also important to bear in mind that even a weakened chavismo still commands a sizable and ardent base of support. Opposition to any US military intervention would likely be fierce, regardless of how the pro-government militias that have been mobilised over the last few weeks ultimately perform. Violent, US-supported regime change would almost certainly result in a long, protracted resistance and insurgency.Given the high risks of a land invasion, another scenario — one involving air strikes but without the amphibious landing of US soldiers on Venezuelan shores — appears more likely. Trump would surely prefer a one-off air strike along the lines of the June attack on Iran. But there is no reason to believe that such an attack would result in the mass uprising and military putsch that Rubio and his allies have been hoping for.We also shouldn’t be surprised if, when the first attack fails to produce the promised uprising, regime-change advocates demand another strike, then another. Convinced the government is on its last legs and needs just one more push, they would likely pressure Trump to keep bombing, and perhaps even support the formation of some form of armed opposition, currently nonexistent in Venezuela.Such a Libya-style proxy war would flood an already volatile region with more weapons and money. Criminal organisations and irregular armed groups already operating on Venezuela’s western border — and beyond, in neighbouring Colombia — would thrive in the chaos, swelling their ranks and profiting from arms and human trafficking: a nightmare scenario for Latin America.The bitter irony is inescapable: an operation justified by anti-narcotics rhetoric would create ideal conditions for drug-trafficking organisations to expand their power. The military build-up off Venezuela’s coast is a slippery slope towards an armed conflagration that could lead to far greater suffering for the Venezuelan people, a potential political quagmire for the United States, US troop casualties and the catastrophic destabilisation of much of the region.","headline":"The US warships off Venezuela aren’t there to fight drugs","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/24/the-us-warships-off-venezuela-arent-there-to-fight-drugs","message":"The US says it is fighting drugs, but its warships off Venezuela tell another story about power, control and regime change.

Nintendo's hybrid Switch console has been even more successful.Microsoft has instead been pushing a strategy of being able to play its games in more places, including on PCs, tablets, phones, and its new handheld console, the ROG Xbox Ally.This has included promoting its subscription service Game Pass, where a monthly charge gets players access to a library of games, similar in style to services like Netflix and Disney+.While there's long been rivalry between PlayStation and Xbox players, some fans of the Halo series are happy to see it reach more people.YouTuber Kara, who streams under the name @Eldeeable, tells BBC Newsbeat that Halo's been a big part of her life.Some Xbox owners have criticised Microsoft for not keeping Halo as an exclusive game, but it reflects a broader move away from exclusivity - with PlayStation releasing games from its The Last Of Us and Horizon series on PC, and even Nintendo making some games with its characters available on mobile phones.\"I know there's a bit of controversy about it coming to PlayStation, but I don't see any reason why it should be like that at all\", she says.The game's executive producer Damon Conn agrees, promising that the remake will appeal to old and new fans.\"At its heart, Halo is about connection, we're thrilled to meet a new generation of players on their platforms of choice to fall in love with Halo the same way we did,\" he says.Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy.

My way of not eating all day is not eating breakfast,\" he says.It's this kind of honesty about not leading the perfect life and struggling with the stuff they know they should do but still don't, that makes them so relatable.The brothers are both medical doctors who've become household names through their TV and radio work - they present children's series Operation Ouch! and Dr Xand is one of BBC's Morning Live resident experts while Dr Chris is well known for his bestselling book Ultra-Processed People.On the podcast, they often disagree with each other over competing claims about health and wellbeing, much like they do in real life.Xand laughs after Chris says it's a hard job working \"with a brother like Xand who is so intensely annoying\".But really the brothers love working together and Chris admits that they started the podcast \"quite selfishly as we were just trying to answer our own questions\".Like most of us, the brothers assumed eight hours was the gold standard for sleep and anything less was a failure. Now, they're far less dogmatic.\"There's so much anxiety around getting eight hours but some of the most important things in my life, like raising kids, I've done sleep deprived,\" says Chris.Realising that everything from winning wars to completing exams were often done with very little sleep, made them understand that sleep deprivation can sharpen your focus in the short term.They have now learnt the \"power of the pause\". If something does not require an immediate decision, they now ask for more time to think about it so they don't feel pressured into saying yes.Chris says this has helped him have difficult conversations he may otherwise have put off. However, he admits he's still figuring out how to be more forceful.The podcast episode on this topic also taught them that they needed to work out what their values are and then weigh up whether requests fitted in with those. For Xand, his priority was spending more time with his wife and two sons.He has since managed to say no to a number of things that he would have otherwise gone along with for an easy life.\"I recently said no to a very big and important work thing even though there was a lot of pressure on me to do it, but it didn't fit with my other commitments and what I wanted to do.\"\"I use brushes for flossing, hold my toothbrush at a different angle and I don't look at my phone while brushing.\"While Chris is shocked that his brother ever used his phone while brushing his teeth, he agrees with how powerful the changes have been.\"It's about the angle of the brush, being more gentle and having a better picture of what you're trying to achieve - you want to clean every surface of every tooth.\"Many people believe that struggling with diet, exercise or breaking habits is down to personal weakness, and Xand shares those feelings.\"I go to Manchester every week and I usually arrive late after a long train journey and I order a takeaway and do no exercise then I beat myself up about it.\"Their expert guest on this podcast episode, psychologist Kimberley Wilson, helped Xand understand that \"there's no such thing as willpower\".Willpower is not this magic thing inside you, instead your ability to stick to something is \"about the way you've arranged the world around you,\" he says.For example, by planning ahead and thinking about what you'll have for dinner, you can more easily ditch the takeaway and eat something healthy.Since the episode, Xand has managed to increase how much exercise he is doing, but still doesn't enjoy it.Another simple change he's made is taking a bag of apples with him on his regular commute between London and Manchester, rather than buying unhealthy snacks on the train.Chris realised willpower wasn't about increasing your tolerance to distress and suffering, but simply being more organised.\"I've started batch-cooking which now releases time for me to do things like read with my daughter.\"For all the changes they've embraced, the brothers are the first to admit they don't follow every bit of expert advice.Take sunscreen, for example. \"A dermatologist gave us really good advice,\" Dr Chris says, \"but there's something about the sun that feels so powerful. Academically, we know sun exposure is bad and causes cancer but we still find ourselves drawn to it.\"If there's one thing the doctors hope listeners take away from the show, it's that struggling with health isn't a personal failure.\"There are loads of forces trying to take your money, attention and time away from the things that matter. What we're trying to do is sweep that out of the way, help you identify your values and align your life with them.\"","headline":"Willpower doesn't exist: Advice from BBC doctors busting wellness myths","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98nd0d61d0o","message":"A giant mug of instant black coffee and no food is not what you'd expect the host of a wellness podcast to have for breakfast.

We asked nine writers to make their case.Start there to understand why Seattle is America’s best sports city. Add this: an emphasis on women’s sports and inclusivity no other metropolis can match. Seattle’s WNBA team, the Storm, is owned and operated by three local businesswomen. Women have held or hold high-level positions for the Storm, Seattle Reign FC (National Women’s Soccer League), the Sounders (MLS), the Mariners (MLB), UW and Seattle University. Fans here show up for women’s sports. The Storm always rank among league leaders in attendance.In the Seattle sports scene, there’s variety: rugby, cricket, cheerleading, roller derby, ultimate Frisbee, Australian football and arena football. Just don’t mistake breadth for a lack of star power. Seattle sports was: Lenny Wilkens, Gus Williams, Shawn Kemp, Gary Payton, Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, Ichiro, Felix Hernandez, Steve Largent, Cortez Kennedy, Walter Jones and Marshawn Lynch. Seattle sports is: Cal Raleigh, Julio Rodriguez and Nneka Ogwumike.We loved and supported soccer before the rest of America came around. We loved and supported the WNBA long before its widespread popularity ballooned. We register decibel-quakes in our football stadium just through our roars and stomping.If “best” sports city in America is defined, simply, as most teams and most titles, then Seattle is not that. But if fans want to feel sports and experience sports and live sports, there’s simply no better, nor more distinct, place.Los Angeles is not the tinseltown caricature of superficiality. Those of us who call it home know better. L.A. is the Diaspora Capital of America, the Creative Capital of America, the Fitness Capital of America.And yes, the Sports Capital of America, a rich mixture of excitement and longing, vulnerability and swagger.L.A. is not just the city where the greatest collection of superstar athletes performed — Koufax, Magic, Kareem, Kobe, Shaq, Serena, Leslie, Kershaw, Kwan, Valenzuela, Ohtani, LeBron, etc. It’s where Wayne Gretzky, playing for the Los Angeles Kings, popularized hockey in California. It’s where David Beckham transformed Major League Soccer. Venus and Serena Williams left the courts of Compton and dominated women’s tennis for a quarter century, winning a combined 48 titles.Where else will you find LeBron James doing a cameo in Tyler the Creator’s latest music video, or see college hoops phenom JuJu Watkins on a billboard and then watch her L.A.-filmed documentary series? Many years ago, I ran into the great James Earl Jones (may he rest in peace) at a backyard cookout in L.A. I sat next to him at a picnic table while he ate his ribs, and we talked about “Field of Dreams,” the sports-movie classic about the spiritual power of baseball.Kevin Merida is the former executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, a former senior vice president of ESPN and a former managing editor of The Post.It’s easy to argue for a major metropolis as America’s best sports city. New York, Los Angeles and Chicago have so many big-time franchises they can’t keep them straight. The Jets used to play in Queens and the Nets used to play in New Jersey, but now the Nets are in Brooklyn and the Jets are in Jersey.Good for them, I guess. I prefer a town where the folks share sporting passions unanimously, not neighborhood by neighborhood. Where new sports find a warm welcome, and sports history has a place of honor. I speak of Kansas City.As for stars of newer vintage: In Patrick Mahomes, a rare three-time Super Bowl MVP, and all-star shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Kansas City boasts a dazzling still-in-their-prime sports duo.Wanna ding K.C. for lacking an NBA franchise? The city has something better: University of Kansas basketball. KU is the cradle of the sport. An overtime game in the historic Phog Allen Fieldhouse is the best college athletic vibe in America.Speaking of college athletics: Kansas City is rekindling one of the oldest and fiercest college rivalries in America. That stuff about harmonious neighborhoods does not apply to Kansas versus the University of Missouri, a tradition busted up by conference realignments but coming back to life.Kansas City cherishes the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. Nowhere is the role of athletes as engines of culture and social progress so delightfully explained and celebrated. As for the future of sport, Kansas City is the first place on the planet to build a stadium just for women’s professional soccer.K.C. is Soccer City. Has been for decades: The same Lamar Hunt who conceived of what is now the American Football Conference and its dominant Chiefs was also the visionary behind European football in the U.S. Next year, the World Cup will pay homage to Kansas City’s long history at the forefront of North American soccer by staging multiple matches here.The entire World Cup tournament will have Kansas City fingerprints. Games in Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, California and Washington will all be played in stadiums designed by architects in Kansas City — the world capital of sports stadium design.Before I was born, it was made clear to my brothers and hence me upon my birth that North Side, South Side, West Side or the suburbs, we could all agree on one thing in Chicago: You rooted for the Bears, the Bulls, the Blackhawks and whichever baseball team your family forced you to support because your grandfather did.I once almost made a friend of my then-7-year-old son cry when he got into our car wearing a Red Sox hat. “Brandon, what are you doing?” I chided him. “We have TWO baseball teams. Pick one.”To be defined by our blind loyalty, however, doesn’t fully capture our passion. We are a smart group. We can, for example, quickly calculate how many offensive coordinators helped doom Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in his eight seasons with the team (six).Melissa Isaacson is an assistant professor at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism and was a longtime Chicago Tribune sportswriter.“This city has been down, and it found a way to get up. It’s found a way to overcome adversity,” Campbell said.We’re not Los Angeles, New York or Chicago. We don’t try to be. We’re too busy surviving hard times and making things better.Then there’s Isiah Thomas, former Piston and NBA Hall of Famer, who spoke during a recent visit with the University of Detroit-Mercy basketball team.“There’s two rules: How bad do you want it and how hard are you going to fight for it ... . ” Thomas said. “Either you’re fighting to keep it or you’re fighting to get it.”A lifelong Cleveland Browns fan and season ticket holder, he also wrote a song each year and sent it to the Cleveland Browns as well as offering other advice on how to run the team. He respectfully requests six Cleveland Browns pallbearers so the Browns can let him down one last time.Last year, a massive winter storm dumped four feet of snow on western New York, as massive winter storms are wont to do.Seats, aisles and playing field sufficiently cleared, quarterback Josh Allen threw two touchdowns and rushed for another as the capacity crowd heaved heaps of snow skyward celebrating a victory they personally labored into existence.Buffalo sports fandom is uniquely vocational. A skilled trade. Proud, often punishing work mastered through participation, repetition and solidarity.Rooting for Buffalo means backing a postindustrial, half-frozen metropolitan area with fewer people than Fresno, California; Birmingham, Alabama; or Richmond, Virginia. We buy in, show up and hitch our teams’ hard times to our own in pursuit of a better place together.The “Bills Mafia” phenomenon has turned Bills fans into a Bills family in which the team itself is fully engrossed. This is a Bills family, worth noting, that does great good when its adherents aren’t, say, gleefully flinging themselves through folding tables during epic tailgating sessions, as has become madcap tradition.New Yorkers are, to say the least, a complacent bunch. Our city is the best in the country, according to us, so it follows that it is certainly the best sports city in the country. With at least one team to root for across every league, fandom here is a Choose Your Own Adventure easily accessible via public transit. We deserve no less, considering all we pay in rent.Meanwhile, the WNBA is the hottest it’s ever been, and no one in the league is hotter than Ellie, the Liberty’s prancing pachyderm. A chic icon fit for a fashion capital. On the NBA side, the surging Knicks are obviously your best bet, and you’ll be in good company at Madison Square Garden with the likes of Spike Lee, Jack Nicholson and Timothée Chalamet. But true sickos like myself can, for some reason, support the Nets. (It’s not my fault that I grew up in Jersey during the Jason Kidd era.)Is your team not meeting your high standards? No sweat. Turn off the TV, lose yourself dancing like Elaine at the high-A Cyclones’ “Seinfeld Night” on Brooklyn’s Coney Island, and wait a year or two. Your squad will make a … brand-new start of it, which I recently heard bellowed from the water feature at the gorgeous, revamped LaGuardia Airport.I’ve been to Boston numerous times, but I was neither raised in nor live in the Northeast. I have been to Fenway Park once, but never the Boston Garden or Gillette Stadium.But when I thought about the top sports town in America, Boston jumped out as the obvious answer. Russell. Bird. Clemens. Pedro. Manny. Big Papi. Brady. Pierce. Those are icons in basketball, football and baseball — full names aren’t necessary.Fenway is probably the best stadium in baseball. The city also has Bill Simmons, who is one of the most influential sports journalists in America, particularly for a Gen X-er like myself. Simmons lives in the L.A. area, but grew up in Boston and is still a superfan of his hometown teams. I vacillate between loving and being annoyed by Simmons, but his articles and now podcasts have shaped my sports fandom and appreciation for the Boston sports scene.","headline":"What is America’s best sports city?

For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.Take sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.","headline":"Magnesium: Can this 'miracle mineral' really help us sleep?","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxn1qxrr32o","message":"Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons.

The house where prosecutors say the games took place stood quiet, no one coming in or out for hours. Late risers in pajamas walked their dogs, two men squabbled over a parking spot, and neighbors and shopkeepers went about their routines.True to New York grit, the owner of a corner bodega and smoke shop remained indifferent, leaning on the counter, unfazed.“They don’t excite me. Come on, we live in the city. S**t happens every day,” the owner, who chose to go by “AK” for his safety, told CNN. His family in India, he says, worked in politics and often had run-ins with their own “Indian Mafia.”“I’ve seen a lot more than what they’re talking about here,” he says. No neighbors CNN spoke to said they knew anything, which did not surprise him. “They’re too rich to be seen like that.”A woman steps in to pay for a bottle of water, eavesdropping on the conversation. She said she had no idea Mafia members had played poker in the apartment building next door to hers, as prosecutors have alleged.She was shocked for a moment when she discovered the news, then shrugged. “I’m not scared. What are they gonna do to me?”At Curry in a Hurry, Sajjad Chowdhury ladles steaming goat curry into a bowl for a customer while reflecting on the news the very building where investigators say the high-stakes poker games took place is just a block away.Outside, the aroma of turmeric, cardamom, and garam masala mingles with the sweet haze of incense drifting down the street and masking the underworld accused of hiding just around the corner.The city may have changed, but its shadows haven’t, and its oldest secrets still live between the cracks of its neighborhoods.A mischievous monkey sketched in chalk perches beneath the sign outside Sally’s Bar, taunting passersby: “Having a s**t day? Grab a BEER.”Inside, slumped on a worn red leather bar stool and cradling a beer, Sally’s regular Scott Hernandez admits he is indeed having a difficult day, then dives into his account of Manhattan’s hidden poker underworld.A stone’s throw from where he’s drinking, surveillance footage showed two Mafia members charged in the case regularly stopping by Sally’s Bar, just meters from the Lexington Avenue building where the rigged poker games took place. Sally’s itself was not connected to the investigation.Entry to the games is strictly by invitation or through a friend with connections, he explains. The tables vary in size but rarely have fewer than five players. Hernandez said the stakes are high: For ordinary folks, buy-ins run into the thousands, and for the wealthy, the price only climbs higher.The idea the victims of the rigged games were lured in by celebrities, in this case allegedly NBA athletes, is common sense to Hernandez.Billups and Jones were dubbed “Face Cards,” professional athletes whose mere presence in the  rigged games offered star power meant to legitimize the games to “attract victims,” according to a detention letter written to the judge.“It’s a way for you to be seen. They’re nobodies, then they’re offered to meet NBA players, and they feel like a somebody. It’s sad,” he says. “It’s about bagging rights, it’s an alpha thing. Like I went and hung out with the mob.”Former Gambino crime family mobster Louis Ferrante used to play those games too, before spending nearly nine years in prison for heists and hijackings, he tells CNN in a phone interview from Florida.“These normal people accidentally fall into a world they don’t belong in,” Ferrante says in a thick, unmistakable Italian-New York accent, each word rolling out with a stubborn gravitas.“Either they’re infatuated by the mob, and they’re that stupid to be hanging out with them, not knowing that they’re going to dig their claws into them at some point, or they think, ‘I’m a nobody, and people want to hang out with me?’”Poker games in New York City aren’t a corporate operation, rather it’s “more like you know a guy who knows a guy,” Ferrante, who authored The Borgata Trilogy, says. They could be held inside restaurants after closing, in someone’s penthouse apartment, or in makeshift “casinos,” like the one Ferrante started in the basement of a friend’s deli back in the day.But no matter the room’s glamour or the famous faces gracing the table, Ferrante warns: some men deal in darkness, and sitting with them is like stepping into a trap you can’t see until it snaps shut.“These guys are predators, everybody’s prey to them,” he says. “They’re not the type of guys to invite into your house for lunch.”Today, New York’s streets gleam with glass towers and boutique cafés. But if you look closely, the Mafia’s mystique and menace still linger.Greenwich Village still wears its history like a second skin, every street a pulse of old New York. Jazz seeps from Blue Note, meeting in the street to mingle with the fragrance of espressos and cappuccinos from Caffè Reggio, while men in Washington Square Park drift through clouds of smoke from their joints.In the heart of this neighborhood’s restless pulse, a Washington Place apartment, linked to the Gambinos, harbored the same secret rigged poker games, according to the indictment.Former undercover FBI agent Joe Cantamessa, who served as a “black bag man,” trained to install hidden cameras and microphones where suspects lived, worked and hung out. He told CNN while the Mafia’s grip on New York City has waned significantly, they’ve discovered new ways to stay in business.“The competition for illicit activities is high, and their ability to operate in those other circles of labor racketeering is a little bit more complicated,” Cantamessa said.“Now they’ll get involved with drugs, prostitution, loan sharking, to an extent, and gambling is still a very resourceful component when they can do that right.”Cantamessa, widely recognized as a key figure in dismantling New York’s most powerful organized crime families, said he was taken aback by just how technologically advanced the rigged poker games had become.In the rigged games, players were unknowingly seated at tables equipped with hidden X-ray cameras that could read facedown cards, while rigged shuffling machines were engineered to predict which players had the best hands and alert off-site operators, who signaled to accomplices through subtle gestures, the indictment stated.The scheme also involved marked cards visible only through “specially designed contact lens or sunglasses,” the indictment said, and officials said defendants also used electronic poker chip trays that tracked the game.In the earlier days, the mob wasn’t just an underworld, it was infrastructure. They controlled garbage routes, construction sites, garment factories, even the price of concrete pouring into the city’s high-rises.But still, like an echo that fades but never completely quiets, their presence threads through the alleys like smoke, gone before you trace where it came from.","headline":"Behind closed doors: How neighbors were oblivious to secret poker games and the Mafia who investigators say helped run them","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/us/nyc-mafia-poker-gambling-neighbors","message":"Behind the glass doors of an unassuming building in Manhattan, staring across a shuttered print shop, a shadowy world stirred, coming alive with the flick of cards, the muted clink of glasses and the quiet hum of a dangerous secret.

She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards.But to her estranged husband, it was a wake-up call to \"just how far things had spiralled out of control\".Decades later, those moments and the others that went on to define the pop star and her very public unravelling are back in the limelight - but what exactly happened and why depends on who is doing the retelling.Like Spears, Federline's book details their intimate and chaotic relationship, the mental anguish they both suffered and provides an inside glimpse at the conservatorship battle that dictated much of Spears' life and career. It provides a side-by-side look, a he-said, she-said dissection of their lives.But the dancer-turned-reality TV star says he's releasing You Thought You Knew after years of hesitation because he does not want his children growing up \"feeling like they have to explain who their father is\".\"Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick,\" she wrote.But, she added, she resolved to go along with the protracted arrangement \"for the sake of my sons,\" even though \"being in it was really hard\".After the conservatorship ended, her father Jamie Spears said it had been \"necessary\" to protect her, but it was time for her to have control back.In his recounting, Federline has a different take. Even when the marriage tanked, it wasn't easy for him to \"watch her spiral\", he writes.Federline supported the arrangement, arguing that it provided \"some semblance of normalcy\" for their two boys together. After her psychiatric hold, Federline says he immediately filed for sole custody, but that set into motion a slew of issues that exacerbated Spears' relationship with their children.His ex, he writes \"saw the events in her life through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one, the person wronged by everyone around her.\"But from where I stood, she needed help. Whether that was rehab or therapy, I couldn't say for sure,\" he writes, noting that she was in no state to manage her own affairs and needed some form of oversight or \"protective layer\".He adds that he came to find out that there was a lot he didn't know about the conservatorship, and he did not push for answers because part of him \"doesn't want to know\".Spears has credited the viral Free Britney movement with helping her find the courage to challenge and eventually escape her conservatorship.\"The fact that my friends and my fans sensed what was happening and did all that for me, that's a debt I can never repay,\" she wrote, thanking them for standing up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself.The pressure from the Free Britney movement, he alleges, led the judge on her conservatorship case \"to ignore the professional reports and cave to public opinion\".\"But none of that truly mattered in the end. If Britney believed she was being held against her will, and everything else she's shared since, then that trauma is real for her. And you can't ignore that,\" he says.Spears has continued to make headlines with strange and sometimes concerning posts on Instagram. Their boys are grown up but, according to Federline, they have haven't seen their mother much, and they don't really want to. Federline has four additional children, along with the two with Spears.\"I still hope that Britney can find peace. Whatever her future holds, I hope it's one where she can finally take control of her own life, on her own terms. This whole saga, twenty years of it, was built on denial. Britney never reached the first step of recovery: admitting there was a problem.\"Spears has laid blame on many people who were once close to her, including two of her exes, Federline and former NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake.In his own memoir, Federline says he was making a career for himself as a professional dancer who worked with Michael Jackson and NSYNC when he crossed paths with Spears.Federline, for his part, is self-aware, writing that he knows people viewed the Fresno, California, native as \"this dude jumped out of his trailer and into Britney's mansion\".In her memoir, Spears recounted the pitfalls of her relationship with Timberlake, including him asking her to have an abortion and the public embarrassment that befell her after he accused her of cheating - further heightened when he cast a Spears lookalike in his music video for Cry Me a River.Federline says that \"there was always something there with Justin that she couldn't let go of\". He says Spears even called Timberlake the night before their wedding to get closure.\"Britney does struggle with mental health problems, that's pretty obvious,\" he told the BBC. \"Exploiting her right now really isn't the best time. I don't think there's any alarm to sound.\"From breaking out on The Mickey Mouse Club as a child star to dancing with a snake around her shoulders at the MTV Music Video Awards, Spears has lived her whole adult life in the spotlight.S Mark Young, a professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America, says Federline's book is unlikely to change people's minds about her.\"I think after this coming week, the book will die. Most people who follow Britney will not be moved,\" he says.Federline denies having an ulterior motive beyond wanting to finally share his side of this infamous saga.For decades, the media, Spears and her family have mostly told Federline's story, largely leaning into his \"bad boy\" persona and making him the butt of many late-night jokes.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes in his book. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies that he ever \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he has always been \"out there hustling, grinding, investing - working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".This opportunity was a way for him to finally share his side after decades of stories, gossip, rumours and accusations - which he says he avoided responding to in hopes of giving his family and children \"some kind of normal life\".Venezuela's attorney general accuses the US president of hoping to turn his country into a \"colony\".Indian singer Zubeen Garg’s music ownership is scattered among a network of producers, distributors and labels.Air traffic controllers are calling out or finding side jobs while they work without pay during the government shutdown, leading to delays.","headline":"Britney Spears said she was used.

She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards.

They are forced to transform, or you're just heading toward disappearance.\"Louis Vuitton's China sales rose 5% in August versus the same month a year earlier, said two people with knowledge of the business, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.While the global economy has been upended by the U.S. trade war, in China economic fundamentals are fragile and data from the Golden Week holiday showed per-capita spending below pre-pandemic levels.Still, earnings point to optimism, helped by comparisons to dismal year-earlier figures, favourable exchange rates and a domestic stock rally.LVMH said China sales \"turned positive\" in its most recent quarter. L'Oreal (OREP.PA), opens new tab said the market has \"gone into positive territory\" and Hermes enjoyed \"very slight improvement\".\"It's good news. Maybe too early to really declare victory, but it's a good sign,\" said Bruno Lannes, senior partner at Bain in Shanghai. The sustainability of the stock rally could also be a wild card, he said.\"Especially for the target customers of luxury, you can expect that those people probably have a retail equity account, so they are seeing the benefits of the stock market rising and feeling more confident to spend more.\"Sophia Liu, CEO of an education company, recently splurged on a Burberry coat, Fendi scarf and Louis Vuitton products in her favourite colours, pink and purple. She said, though there is ample economic and geopolitical uncertainty, that is having less of an impact on big spending decisions.\"I think people in China have gotten more used to uncertainty overall,\" she said. \"A lot of my friends work in the technology industry, and their companies have gone IPO. So, mostly I feel people around me are more positive at the moment.\"Luxury brands that invested during the downturn are likely to win market share as spending stabilises, even if revenue does not significantly grow, said Jacques Roizen, managing director of China consulting at Digital Luxury Group.\"In a market that is now basically flat, brand performance will no longer be fuelled by overall market growth,\" Roizen said. \"Those that succeed now will do so by gaining market share from others via optimisation and innovation.\"","headline":"Luxury brands turn on the charm in China to kindle nascent spending recovery","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/luxury-brands-turn-charm-china-kindle-nascent-spending-recovery-2025-10-27/","message":"Firms like LVMH (LVMH.

She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"While Copeland has hung up her shoes for the moment, she told the Associated Press after her announcement that she hasn't ruled out a return: \"You know, I've become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying 'thank you' to the company. So, it's a farewell. (But) it won't be the end of me dancing… Never say never.\"\"Is it hard to think that one day you won't be dancing the way you have been?\" asks Kay. \"Not at all,\" replies Copeland, equally directly. \"I already feel like I'm kind of in this place where it feels really natural. I haven't been on stage in about three years. I know I'll be back on the stage at some point. And that may look very different from what it's been throughout my professional career.\"From on stage to on the page, Copeland has danced in hundreds of shows around the world; written children's books and an autobiography; launched two athletic clothing lines; founded a charitable organisation; and last year, became a mother to her son, Jackson, with her husband, attorney Olu Evans. (She has her own Barbie doll, too.)\"I have so many things in my life that kind of fulfil what ballet has been, and ballet is still in that: it's [also] the work I'm doing through my foundation, it's these incredible projects I'm creating with my production company, it's having a son. To me, this feels like a really natural evolution, that I'm just going with the flow,\" says Copeland. Calm and resolute, she adds, \"I'm so content and I'm so proud of the career that I've had.One day, she may perform again, but listening to her body and slipping off the pointe shoes, for now, \"just feels right\".\"I recently had another operation to relieve some of the pressure and it didn't do anything, so that's really the biggest battle that I'm facing, not so much my age. We're ever evolving as artists, as people, as women. You kind of have to just move and adjust with that, but when you're dealing with pain, that's a whole other story.\"\"There's so many mixed feelings around this image, because you don't typically see that many black people going into Lincoln Center. So, for what it represents, there's so many happy memories,\" says Copeland. Yet bitter recollection also tempers the sweet side: \"I also had six stress fractures in my tibia [from that performance], and pulled out of the season the next day.\"As she details the pain-laced memories on her way to becoming a principal dancer, Copeland's strength and determination shine through. Resilience is another core theme in Copeland's story. Kay asks her to reflect on a difficult childhood, and asks if she sought bodily autonomy via the strictures of ballet. \"I think it was more than the control over my body,\" she says. \"I think it was control over the situation. It was control over my life in some way. It was consistency. It was stability. It was an escape – a beautiful, artistic-expression escape.\"Now, Copeland is finding the escape of expression in other ways — ones that don't put her body on the line quite so much.Throughout the years, interviewers and fans alike have frequently asked Copeland about her experiences being one of few professional ballet dancers of colour – and this work is where she prefers to take the conversation. \"There are so many things that I think about in terms of disrupting the field and provoking the conversation to be really intentional about the lack of diversity,\" she says.When pushed to reflect on the body-judgment she faced as a ballet dancer who looked \"different\" from others in her company, Copeland puts the criticism into context. \"I was told I was too muscular, I was too short, my breasts are too big. And to me, that's all code for your skin is too dark, your skin is too brown.\"But she believes it is possible for ballet to be more inclusive. \"It's not about what the package is it's how you make people feel; it's how you deliver the performance, the character, and that can be done in a variety of ways\", she says, adding the works themselves fail to reflect modern society.\"I look at myself and my career is not me,\" Copeland says, when asked why she's influential. \"It's what I represent. It's all of the people that have gotten me to this place that I stand on the shoulders of. I just think of my life and my career as this very holistic thing, it's give and take, and it's not just about me. It's so much bigger than me.\"If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.Find out how the ornate ceramics known as Iznik tiles hold the key to a forgotten golden age of Turkish art.Ancient documents made with washi, the hand-crafted Japanese paper, are proof of its remarkable longevity.Passed down through generations in Gokayama, the Japanese tradition of Kokiriko honours the cycle of life.How America's first professional female tattooist broke through into an art form historically dominated by men.BBC Click visits a simulator lab that allows musicians to practice performance in real-world conditions.BBC Click heads behind the scenes of the Sydney Opera House to explore the tech powering the famous landmark.We find out how AI blurs the line between creation and automation, raising questions about the essence of art.The BBC's Katty Kay has spoken to successful change-makers to ask what made them pivot in their career.Zeinab Badawi heads to Athens to celebrate the centenary of the birth of opera soprano Maria Callas.Art critic Alastair Sooke travels to Doha to discover some of the treasures of the Museum of Islamic Art.Born from a desire to make boats go faster, today the hydrofoil is being revived as a cleaner form of water transport by helping boats rise above the waves.From red-leaf hunting in Japan to Scotland's \"big tree country\", here are four destinations to experience the season's vibrant show.Jump scares and gore might not seem like the most soothing watching, but scary films can actually be the ideal therapy during anxious times.Italy's sleeper from Milan to Sicily ends with a rare rail-ferry crossing that's threatened by a new mega bridge.","headline":"Ballet legend Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to move past dance","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231214-misty-copeland-interview-influential-katty-kay","message":"The ballet legend told the BBC's Katty Kay she hadn't been on a stage in years – and now, after listening to her body, she's evolving her professional aspirations accordingly.

An autopsy revealed “no signs of trauma or foul play,” but the cause and manner of McKissic’s death remain pending, according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.“That was probably the biggest deal…that’s when college students started getting really worried,” Houston Council Member Letitia Plummer said.Alarmed by the chain of bodies pulled out of bayous, some Houston residents took to social media to try to make sense of the deaths, with posts pushing theories of a serial killer garnering thousands of likes. Family members of some of those found in the waterways have also shown skepticism over the death investigations and called for more answers.“He did not fall in that bayou,” the father Kenneth Cutting Sr. told CNN affiliate KHOU. “I don’t know if there’s a serial killer but the way that they’re dealing with these bodies is ridiculous.”Meanwhile, local officials like Plummer and Council Member Carolyn Evans-Shabazz advised community members to be vigilant and walk in pairs along the bayous as they pressed for answers to quell unease and pondered a task force that could be formed to investigate the deaths.But the Houston Police Department and Mayor Whitmire have vehemently refuted the serial killer conspiracy theories and insist the deaths aren’t connected. None of the fatalities have been ruled homicides.“It’s a typical human response to this sort of kind of incident,” said Robert Spicer, a communications professor at Millersville University who has researched conspiracy theories.A variety of factors could have contributed to the deaths – and the rumors enveloping the lack of answers, experts say.Authorities and experts say there are no connections between the victims that would lead them to believe a serial killer was involved.“We weren’t able to find any kind of typical pattern,” said Houston Police Captain Salam Zia at the September news conference. “It runs the gamut – genders, ethnicities, age range.”“There’s not one specific type of person. It’s really sort of a bunch of different people that are unfortunately losing their life related to these bodies of water,” said Krista Gehring, a criminal justice professor at the University of Houston.All but one of the deaths happened within the city of Houston. At least five of the deaths were confirmed in Brays Bayou, where McKissic was found. Three others were in Buffalo Bayou and one was in White Oak Bayou.The cause and manner of death in the cases included accidental drownings, a suicide, drug toxicity, blunt force trauma and cardiovascular disease, according to the medical examiner data.For eight of the deaths, the cause was undetermined, meaning “it is impossible to establish, with reasonable medical certainty, the circumstances of death after thorough investigation,” according to the medical examiner. The cause of death is pending in another eight cases, meaning they need further information.Multiple of the deaths reported in the bayous last year are still listed as undetermined as well, according to medical examiner data.“There’s been a lot of bodies found,” Kenneth Cutting Sr. told KHOU, highlighting that like his son, multiple have undetermined as a cause of death.It’s common for the cause of death to be undetermined when people die in waterways, says Jay Coons, a criminal justice professor at Sam Houston State University who served with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office for over three decades.“The putrefaction process of the human body and water is just horribly destructive,” Coons said. “When you put a body in the water…evidence can be washed away, but also with our hot, humid environment, pretty quickly the body can putrify to the extent that you’re left with very little.”The only evidence left would be obvious injuries inflicted from a stabbing, strangulation or shooting, he said. Medical examiners would also conduct a chemical analysis during an autopsy to test for poisons and medical conditions.To determine the presence of a serial killer, investigators would have to take two steps: First, the medical examiner would have to rule the death a  homicide. Second, they would have to find commonalities between those cases, such as gender, profession or the type of injuries they sustained.Drownings are also uncommon in serial killer cases. “Typically serial killers tend to kill their victims with very sort of intimate, close-up ways, whether it’s strangulation or bludgeoning or stabbing,” Gehring said.Even if there was a serial killer disposing of bodies in the bayous, that would be highly unusual, she added. “You’re risking carrying a body and dumping it into water and people in the public seeing you do it.”While there are no indications that a serial killer is behind the deaths, that doesn’t rule out the possibility entirely, Coons said. Seeing any evidence of ritualistic activity would be of particular concern, and in that case, investigators would reach out to other homicide units to check if they’ve seen similar crimes, he added.Concerns among the community about the bayou deaths heightened when McKissic and others were unexplainably found dead within weeks of each other.Plummer, who lives off of a bayou, said she started getting calls from community leaders asking for more information about the deaths. That’s when Plummer said she asked Mayor Whitmire and Houston Police Chief J. Noe Diaz to provide details on the deaths.“It was a misstep to not…take the fear, take the comments of our community to heart and act on it with more decisive information and in a more timely manner,” Plummer said.But the news conference held by Whitmire and Diaz just “caused more confusion” because the mayor without evidence linked the deaths to homelessness, Plummer said, though many of the deaths are still under investigation.Experts say there may be some truth to that theory. A movement within Houston to relocate a lot of the homeless population from downtown could lead them to set up camp along bayous, according to Gehring and Coons. Other factors may be substance abuse, mental health issues and unstable bayous causing falls, they said.“If you have a body of water, you’re going to have deaths that are related to that body of water,” Gehring said.“The less information you give to people, the more people make assumptions,” Plummer said. “People start creating their own ideas of what’s going on.”Having the demographic data, like gender and race, helped alleviate some of the unease residents were feeling and dispel some of the conspiracy theories, Plummer said.“Until I am given different rationale or reason behind these bodies, I’m going to try to just keep people from panicking,” Evans-Shabazz said.A growing obsession with true crime in the media, a mistrust of authorities in the US and a history of conspiracy theories in American culture likely contributed to rumors and misinformation about the bayou deaths, Spicer said.Another video on YouTube took it further: “Whoever is committing these murders know that once a body is in a bayou, most evidence will be destroyed.”The increased attention to the bayou deaths may also be fueling much of the fear that residents are feeling, according to the experts.“Something can fly pretty much under the radar until it’s publicized somehow or it catches the public’s interest and all of a sudden it just explodes,” said Coons, comparing the speculation to a game of telephone.“It’s easier to sort of attribute these deaths to a boogeyman serial killer as opposed to confronting the real possible reasons that these deaths are happening,” she said, pointing to mental health, substance abuse and housing issues.But Plummer said she’s working on putting additional safety measures in place along the bayous that could help, including improved lighting, rain signage, call boxes and increased security. Evans-Shabazz says it would be difficult to install cameras along the bayous, but urged residents to check their camera footage for unusual activities.A task force may also be formed to investigate the deaths once the medical examiner’s findings on manner and cause of death are available, Plummer said.But it may take several weeks to months for a final report to be issued on each death following an autopsy, according to the medical examiner’s office.“There’s still work that detectives can do while that ruling is coming forth: interview witnesses, document what the scene looked like, try to recover some surveillance footage, any digital evidence that we can find,” Zia, the police captain, said.It’s been over a month since McKissic died, leaving loved ones hurting and waiting for answers about why they lost her.Community members streamed to vigils honoring the student, who was described by the university as “a friend to many in our community.” Others paid tribute to her in her obituary, remembering her “intelligence and humor.”Another victim, Rodney Chatman, was found dead in a bayou the same day that McKissic was. The cause and manner of his death remain pending, according to the medical examiner.“Something has to be done,” his sister Xzaviere Chatman told KHOU. “We will never see our loved ones again.”","headline":"Bodies keep being recovered from the bayous around Houston.

When deputies went to Melodee Buzzard’s home to investigate, her mother was there – but the young girl was nowhere to be found.Now, officials are investigating why her mom drove them in a rental car from California to Nebraska and why the 9-year-old was apparently wearing a wig in surveillance photos captured earlier this month.The last person who was with Melodee was her mother, Ashlee, on October 7, possibly during the road trip to Nebraska, investigators have said.But Ashlee “has been uncooperative with investigators” throughout the search for the missing child, authorities say.Melodee’s disappearance has sparked an investigation into the child’s whereabouts as the search approaches its second week.“We are hopeful that Melodee might be with someone – perhaps an extended family member or friend – who may not be aware of the circumstances of her disappearance,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.With only years-old photos of Melodee and an allegedly uncooperative mother, officials are working with scant details about the young girl. But detectives have narrowed the “critical timeline” to three days in early October.On October 7, the first day of investigators’ three-day timeline, the young girl was spotted in surveillance photos wearing what appeared to be a wig to disguise her natural hair, as well as a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled over her head, authorities said. The surveillance photos were taken at a local car rental agency, according to authorities.“Detectives are now focused on determining where Melodee was during those three days and where she may be now,” the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said.Family members held a vigil in Lompoc on Friday near the home where investigators first went to look for Melodee, according to The Lompoc Record.“If she’s listening, we love you. We’re here for you, and we just want you to be happy,” her grandmother, Lilly Denes, told CNN affiliate KSBY. “Call me. There are numbers on the TV that you can call, and I will come pick you up.”“Our detectives are following every lead in this case. We continue to seek information from the public that could help us find Melodee,” said Brown. “We remain determined to bring her home safely.”In an interview with NewsNation that aired Friday, Melodee’s aunt said she had not seen her niece in four years.“She was just a little 4-year-old girl when we knew her, but that nose definitely reminds me of her dad’s, so yeah, it does look like her,” Lizabeth Meza told NewsNation.","headline":"Search for missing 9-year-old centers on road trip with mother, who police say is ‘uncooperative’","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/26/us/missing-child-search-melodee-buzzard","message":"A school administrator reported a 9-year-old girl missing after she hadn’t been seen in months.

For decades, Tomas - who lives in the small village of Nueva Oceania - had been practically a neighbour to these nomadic people, who shun contact with outsiders. However, until very recently, he had rarely seen them.The Mashco Piro have chosen to be cut off from the world for more than a century. They hunt with long bows and arrows, relying on the Amazonian rainforest for everything they need.\"They started circling and whistling, imitating animals, many different types of birds,\" Tomas recalls.\"I kept saying: 'Nomole' (brother). Then they gathered, they felt closer, so we headed toward the river and ran.\"It claims the biggest risks are from logging, mining or drilling for oil. Uncontacted groups are extremely vulnerable to basic disease - as such, the report says a threat is posed by contact with evangelical missionaries and social media influencers looking for clicks.The area is not recognised as a protected reserve for uncontacted groups, and logging companies operate here.Tomas says that, at times, the noise of logging machinery can be heard day and night, and the Mashco Piro people are seeing their forest disturbed and destroyed.In Nueva Oceania, people say they are conflicted. They fear the Mashco Piro's arrows but they also have deep respect for their \"brothers\" who live in the forest and want to protect them.\"Let them live as they live, we can't change their culture. That's why we keep our distance,\" says Tomas.The people in Nueva Oceania are worried about the damage to the Mascho Piro's livelihood, the threat of violence and the possibility that loggers might expose the Mashco Piro to diseases they have no immunity to.While we were in the village, the Mashco Piro made their presence felt again. Letitia Rodriguez Lopez, a young mother with a two-year-old daughter, was in the forest picking fruit when she heard them.\"We heard shouting, cries from people, many of them. As if there were a whole group shouting,\" she told us.It was the first time she had encountered the Mashco Piro and she ran. An hour later, her head was still pounding from fear.\"Because there are loggers and companies cutting down the forest they're running away, maybe out of fear and they end up near us,\" she said. \"We don't know how they might react to us. That's what scares me.\"The Peruvian government has a policy of non-contact with isolated people, making it illegal to initiate interactions with them.The policy originated in Brazil after decades of campaigning by indigenous rights groups, who saw that initial contact with isolated people lead to entire groups being wiped out by disease, poverty and malnutrition.\"Isolated indigenous peoples are very vulnerable - epidemiologically, any contact could transmit diseases, and even the simplest ones could wipe them out,\" says Issrail Aquisse from the Peruvian indigenous rights group, Femanad. \"Culturally too, any contact or interference can be very harmful to their life and health as a society.\"As Tomas shows us around the forest clearing where he encountered the Mashco Piro, he stops, whistles through his hands and then waits in silence.\"If they answer, we turn back,\" he says. All we can hear is the chatter of insects and birds. \"They're not here.\"Tomas feels the government has left the residents of Nueva Oceania to handle a tense situation by themselves.He plants food in his garden for the Mashco Piro to take. It is a safety measure he and other villagers have come up with to help their neighbours and protect themselves.\"I wish I knew the words to say, 'Here have these plantains, it's a gift,'\" he adds. \"'You can take them freely. Don't shoot me.'\"The Mashco Piro appear regularly, sometimes several times a week. They are a different group of people from those near Nueva Oceania, and the agents don't believe they know each other.\"They always come out at the same place. That's where they shout from,\" Antonio says, pointing across the wide Manu River to a small shingly beach on the other side. They ask for plantain, yucca or sugar cane.\"If we don't answer, they sit there all day waiting,\" Antonio says. The agents try to avoid that, in case tourists or local boats pass by. So they usually comply. The control post has a small garden they grow food in. When it runs out, they ask a local village for supplies.If these aren't available, the agents ask the Mashco Piro to come back in a few days' time. It has worked so far, and there has been little conflict recently.They name themselves after animals. The chief is called Kamotolo (Honey Bee). The agents say he is a stern man and never smiles.Another leader, Tkotko (Vulture) is more of a joker, he laughs a lot and makes fun of the agents. There is a young woman called Yomako (Dragon) who the agents say has a good sense of humour too.The Mashco Piro don't seem to have much interest in the outside world but are interested in the personal lives of the agents they meet. They ask about their families and where they live.When one agent was pregnant and went on maternity leave, they brought a rattle made from the throat of a howler monkey for the baby to play with.They are interested in the agents' clothes, especially sports clothes in red or green.  \"When we approach, we put on old, torn clothes with missing buttons - so they don't take them,\" Antonio says.\"Before, they wore their own traditional clothing - very beautiful skirts made with threads from insect fibres that they crafted themselves. But now some of them, when tourist boats pass, receive clothes or boots.\" says Eduardo Pancho Pisarlo, an agent at the control post.\"Once, I asked how they light their fires,\" says Antonio. \"They told me, 'You have wood, you know.' I insisted, and they said, 'You already have all these things - why do you want to know?'\"If someone doesn't appear for quite a while, the agents will ask where they are. If the Mashco Piro say, \"Don't ask\", they take it to mean that person has died.After years of contact, the agents still know little about how the Mashco Piro live or why they remain in the forest.Experts think the Mashco Piro may be closely related to the Yine, an indigenous people from south-eastern Peru. They speak an antiquated dialect of the same language, which the agents, who are also Yine, have been able to learn.But the Yine have long been river navigators, farmers and fishermen, while the Mashco Piro seem to have forgotten how to do these things. They may have become nomads and hunter-gatherers to stay safe.\"What I understand now is that they stay in one area for a while, set up a camp, and the whole family gather,\" says Antonio. \"Once they've hunted everything around that place, they move to another site.\"\"They ask for bananas and cassava to diversify their diet, but some families disappear for months or years after that,\" he says.The Mashco Piro in this area are well protected but the government is building a road which will connect it to an area where illegal mining is widespread.\"We need them to be free like us,\" says Tomas. \"We know they lived very peacefully for years, and now their forests are being finished off - destroyed.\"Born from a desire to make boats go faster, today the hydrofoil is being revived as a cleaner form of water transport by helping boats rise above the waves.Oxford City Council says it is the first authority to try to \"close the gap\" with global guidelines.A green advisor to the Welsh government criticises carbon capture investment over cutting energy bills.Platforms, including Open AI's Sora, have gone viral due to their ability to make hyper-realistic videos.","headline":"'Brothers in the forest': The fight to protect an isolated Amazon tribe","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw92x915xlo","message":"Tomas Anez Dos Santos was working in a small clearing in the Peruvian Amazon, when he heard footsteps approaching in the forest. \"One was standing, aiming with an arrow,\" he says.  \"And somehow he noticed I was here and I started to run. \"He had come face to face with the Mashco Piro."},{"details":"President Donald Trump said that he received an MRI scan during a recent trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center – marking the first time he has provided a reason for his second medical exam this year and raising new questions about the president’s health.“I gave you the full results.

Treatment may involve medication or, in later stages, medical procedures.Trump has also faced scrutiny over regular bruising on his right hand that he’s appeared at times to cover up with heavy makeup.The White House physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has attributed it to a combination of “frequent handshaking” and aspirin use, which can increase bruising.","headline":"Trump says he received an MRI during trip to Walter Reed medical center","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/donald-trump-mri-health-walter-reed","message":"President Donald Trump said that he received an MRI scan during a recent trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center – marking the first time he has provided a reason for his second medical exam this year and raising new questions about the president’s health. “I gave you the full results.

His fishing boat had capsized.\"The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,\" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association.Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to \"stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters\".On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.\"I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,\" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. \"The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\"A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.\"Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,\" he said. \"If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.\"\"Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,\" he told the BBC.Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.\"The haul is basically worthless,\" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.\"The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,\" Park continued. \"I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.\"Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as \"a vicious and tragic cycle\".When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, \"you have a higher chance of meeting disaster\", she explained.\"It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,\" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. \"Ultimately it is their call when to go out,\" she said.As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. \"Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,\" she said.Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. \"Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.\"The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.Because the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.\"Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.\"Born from a desire to make boats go faster, today the hydrofoil is being revived as a cleaner form of water transport by helping boats rise above the waves.A green advisor to the Welsh government criticises carbon capture investment over cutting energy bills.","headline":"South Korea's fishermen keep dying.

We didn't do that because it seemed unreasonable,\" Bisharo Abdirahman Omar said.The reaction was unsurprising as the Somali-speaking nomadic community earn their living by raising livestock, which are often threatened by predators such as cheetahs, leopards, lions, and hyenas.\"But I decided that since people are killing these animals, maybe we should raise them instead and be different.\"The family cared for the cub for two years and three months, during which it became an inseparable part of the family.\"The animal was troublesome at first, but in the end, it became tame and became one of the children,\" he said.The family have been praised by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) for their generosity in looking after an animal which is often killed or trafficked.Sharmaarke Mohamed, head of the Northeastern Conservancy Association (NECA), says cheetahs and wildlife across north-eastern Kenya are facing a growing crisis that has gone largely unnoticed.\"This young cheetah that was recently found was most likely orphaned, its mother was either killed or poisoned,\" he said.According to the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the smuggling of baby cheetahs is widespread in the region, with active trafficking routes running through northern Kenya, eastern Ethiopia, and Somalia.Ms Omar said the family were approached by people who wanted to buy the young cheetah but they refused to sell it.While KWS praised the family for looking after the cheetah, it pointed out that keeping wild animals as pets is against the law.\"We deeply appreciate the Good Samaritan's compassion and remind all Kenyans that true coexistence means protecting wildlife,\" the agency said.The fall of el-Fasher would cement the RSF's control of the west and reinforces a de facto split in the nation.The education minister says the movement of staff and students has been affected by the scarcity of fuel.President Samia Suluhu Hassan faces no real competition at the polls amid a climate of self-censorship and fear.The fall of el-Fasher would cement the RSF's control of the west and reinforces a de facto split in the nation.","headline":"'It became one of the children': Kenyan family on adopting orphaned cheetah cub","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gj4x4939qo","message":"A Kenyan family has told the BBC how a cheetah cub they adopted after finding it lying next to its dead mother became almost like one of their children.

And they’re increasingly hammering President Donald Trump for his failure to sit down to negotiate with Democrats, while instead embarking on his second foreign trip so far during the shutdown.“This is all Trump,” a visibly frustrated Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont told CNN. “Trump’s not engaged. Republicans won’t negotiate,” Welch said, arguing that Trump’s trip to Asia this week as “an indication of how he could care less.”A fired-up Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia was even more blunt, calling it “outrageous” that Trump would take another foreign trip with the government shut down.“The message is, frankly, President Trump: ‘Stay in America. Put America first. Sit down with us and work this out’,” Warner said.The US Department of Agriculture said Sunday it will not use its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food stamp benefits next month as the government shutdown continues.When asked Friday whether he would direct the USDA to fund food stamps next month, Trump told reporters: “Yeah, everybody is going to be in good shape, yep.”The president did not provide further details, but his comments seem to conflict with the agency’s statement.Behind the scenes, GOP lawmakers and senior aides believe the White House is eager to find some way to keep those SNAP payments flowing to the poorest Americans. Members of both parties — including GOP and Democratic governors — have been furiously pushing the White House to find a way to avoid that outcome, according to two people familiar with the discussions.“Not a single American should go hungry. And the challenge that we confront right now is that Donald Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill are trying to weaponize hunger in order to jam their extreme right wing policies in their spending bill down the throats of the American people,” Jeffries told reporters on Friday, arguing that the Trump administration has roughly $5 billion in an emergency contingency fund that could be used for the SNAP program.As part of their pressure campaign, dozens of Democrats signed a letter to Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Friday, arguing that the administration has the existing funds and authority to fully fund SNAP benefits.One GOP lawmaker — Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley — is so concerned about SNAP that he has introduced legislation to fund the program for the duration of the shutdown. Leavitt said Thursday the administration would support the bill, but it’s not clear whether it will come up.Asked on Thursday whether Trump should work to alleviate some of the pressure points in the shutdown, like SNAP benefits, another GOP senator suggested there may be some procedural hurdles to doing so.“I think it’s simpler said than done,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall responded, adding, “On the one hand, there needs to be some pressure to put on the Democrats to come to the table and do something.”Marshall, who is also an obstetrician-gynecologist, said he had a “lot of concern” about the SNAP and WIC program. He observed, “It is very important to my practice. Lots of pregnant women, breastfeeding women use that program as well. I think it’s a good pressure point for them.”GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri said the solution for the shutdown’s various pressure points was “for the Democrats to vote to fund the government.”","headline":"Democrats unflinching in shutdown strategy, blaming Trump with millions at risk of losing food aid","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/politics/government-shutdown-snap-food-stamps","message":"But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are signaling that there will be no change in strategy: Democrats won’t provide the votes to reopen the government unless their demands over health care are met.

That’s even as the push adds a late dose of uncertainty to the governor’s race, with Republicans crying foul about the impact on the last full week before the November 4 election.Earle-Sears blasted the Democrats’ effort at a weekend campaign event hosted by the Conservative Political Action Conference Latino coalition.“That’s not what we do here,” she said. “We need to be really making the case to all of the voters of Virginia.”Jared Leopold, a strategist who works with Democrats across Virginia, saod President Donald Trump’s national push to redraw US House maps in his favor ahead of the midterms requires swift Democratic action. In Leopold’s view, statewide Democrats should lean into having another mechanism to fight back against the administration.“Policy-wise, I think everybody wants it,” said one Democratic operative working on the statewide races. “But is this what we want the closing argument to be on the campaign?”Once roommates, now candidates for governor: Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill try to lead a Democratic revivalVirginia Democratic leaders haven’t explicitly said they are calling back lawmakers on Monday to discuss redistricting. Their plans, first reported by the Virginia Scope newsletter, were confirmed to CNN by two sources familiar with the matter discussing internal deliberations.To bypass the nonpartisan commission that governs the drawing of US House lines in the state, Virginia lawmakers have to take the issue to voters.The Virginia House and Senate, both of which have narrow Democratic majorities, would have to pass a constitutional amendment in the special session and again in a new session after the November 4 election. It would then go on a ballot next year.Alex Keena, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, described the maneuvers as “super lengthy and unrealistic.”“We’re talking like a yearslong process of two separate general assemblies approving it, and then the voters approving it. That’s not an easy or quick thing,” Keena said.In a virtual news conference Thursday, state House GOP leader Terry Kilgore said he was told by reliable sources that redistricting is the intended purpose of the session resuming this week.Republicans such as conservative radio host John Fredericks said Earle-Sears should lean into the redistricting effort with a news conference in Richmond on the first day of the special session.“If you want unfiltered, raw power grabs that cost money that have nothing to do with making life better for Virginians, here it is,” said Fredericks, who argued Virginia Democrats’ effort won’t land the same way as in California, where voters go to the polls next month to vote on temporarily redrawing the state’s maps at Gov.

And we get upset when someone doesn’t have the same game plan,” said Thomas Faupl, a licensed family and marriage therapist who specializes in financial therapy.Not to mention that everybody’s money behaviors are influenced by their experiences around money growing up.But you can defuse your disagreements so that they are not perpetually difficult — or fatal — for your relationship.Start by recognizing that money fights are usually about something bigger. Then explore what those bigger issues are so that you each can better hear where the other is coming from.That’s just some of the advice Heather and Douglas Boneparth — an attorney and certified financial planner, respectively — offer in their new book “Money Together: How to Find Fairness in Your Relationship and Become an Unstoppable Financial Team.”The specifics of couples’ disputes differ. But Faupl finds the most common types of money disagreements revolve around:Saving and spending: One partner may have a much higher bar to feel financially secure, while the other may prioritize living life for today.The question is whether each partner can appreciate where the other is coming from and find a middle ground that works for them both.High levels of debt: Whether a couple gets into a lot of debt together, or one partner amasses it, it is fertile ground for a fight over how to manage it and how long to tolerate it, he said.A couple with kids, for instance, has to make a lot of ongoing money decisions around that debt: Should we take a family vacation? Should we get a bigger house? Where should we cut back? Who should give up what?Disparities in wealth: One spouse might come from wealth or may have amassed it in their career, while the other hasn’t. Or there could just be a big disparity in partners’ salaries, which can lead to a lot of uncomfortable discussions about divisions of labor and who has more say over money decisions.When you’re on the verge of a money fight with your partner, try asking yourself the following questions before going off:Douglas Boneparth recalled one couple they interviewed where the wife had a meltdown after her husband bought an extra croissant at a 7-Eleven. Turns out, the croissant was innocent. The problem for the wife was that she felt her husband was not living up to their years-earlier agreement to split expenses evenly. The blowup taught them that the old arrangement wasn’t working for either of them.Understanding the current context for your partner’s actions can help too. Why did the wife lose it at that particular moment? Her outburst coincided with her concerns that she might lose her job.Going in to a contentious money discussion with criticisms about your spouse — or you as a couple — isn’t a winning approach.Instead, he suggested, start with what your spouse — and you together — have been doing right. “You’ll have a much easier time staying engaged.”While you and your partner may always approach money differently, you still need to make joint financial decisions you both can live with. To get there, keep your eye on the prize.Take investing, for example. If one of you is risk averse and the other isn’t, consider what your shared goals are.There are a lot of ways to get there. And what works for you as a couple may not be as binary or extreme in risk-taking as you expect. “It could be incremental — maybe not as much as one partner wants but more than you ever would do,” Heather Boneparth said.Lastly, she noted, remember that while the unknown is scary and appetite for risk is individual, “our capacity for risk is joint because we’re together.”","headline":"Fighting over money with your partner?

Ongoing transmission in the United States puts it among a group of countries that also face scrutiny from international leaders and are at risk of a similar fate.In early November, the Pan American Health Organization, a regional WHO office, will convene an annual meeting of its Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission to formally determine the status of measles elimination across the region.“A country is no longer considered to be measles free if the virus returns and transmission is sustained continuously for more than a year,” WHO said in a statement. “There are no formal consequences of losing measles elimination status, however having measles again as an endemic disease will have a profound negative impact on communities, including preventable deaths among some of the most vulnerable populations.”Countries that lose elimination status will be asked to submit a corrective action plan, which may include efforts focused on intensified vaccination activities, strengthened surveillance and rapid outbreak response.“Immunization coverage across the Region is insufficient to stop outbreaks from occurring, and also hides pockets within countries that have even lower coverage. The Region needs to sustain high coverage, quality surveillance and rapid response at all times,” WHO said.The potential to lose elimination status “highlights the severity of the measles outbreak,” Bowdish said. “If you look at the other countries that also have circulating measles, you see that they are countries without strong public health like Canada and they are countries that have been torn apart by war or civil unrest. It is an eye-opener about how you need to have constant vigilance and consistent support for public health in order to fight infectious disease.”And Canada isn’t the only country posing a risk to the region. Six others — including the US and Mexico — have active measles transmission situations that will be discussed at the PAHO commission meeting. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January to withdraw the US from WHO, but PAHO says that it expects US officials – both from the CDC and the National Sustainability Commission – to attend the commission meeting on measles elimination next month.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the elimination of measles an historic achievement, credited to a “highly effective vaccination program” in the US and better measles control across the Americas region.Researchers from McMaster University say that vaccine hesitancy is fueled by a “complex blend of personal, social and environmental factors.”Individual behaviors are influenced by community, both in physical proximity and through social media, they said.","headline":"Canada is poised to lose its measles elimination status — and the US could, too","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/27/health/measles-elimination-canada-us-who","message":"Monday marks a full year of continuous measles transmission in Canada, a milestone that’s poised to set the country back decades on a global health commitment.

Building incentives will help me exercise more. Good friendships will help me live longer.As a wellness writer, I spend a lot of my days reporting on new research findings in the health and wellness field, vetted by outside experts, usually including advice on how to live better.Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Alberta are looking for a large pool of participants for a new study. With CNN having covered so many studies like this one, the researchers are hoping readers will want to participate — and CNN is following along to report on the research process from the ground floor.All you have to do is take a daily quiz on the research team’s website to assess what you know about healthy habits.WANT TO JOIN ME? You can sign up for the quiz here on the researchers’ website and get started right away.“This is actually an opportunity for folks to contribute to research by joining our website,” said lead researcher Dr. Katie Mehr, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Alberta. “After the study concludes and we’re able to analyze all the data, we will share what we found with the readership.”Researchers can’t share exactly what questions they are investigating because that could risk skewing the results. But the study team hopes the experience will be a way for people to engage with science and pull back the curtain on how the questions about human behavior are answered, Mehr said.“Sometimes there’s these questions where, if we could get a large sample of people who were dealing with this in their life to engage science, we could learn a lot,” said behavioral researcher Dr. Katy Milkman, James G. Dinan Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “Sometimes it’s hard to figure out where do you meet those people.”This study is “a fun opportunity for people to be part of what they’re constantly reading and … get to be part of the news,” Milkman said. “They will change the news like citizen scientists.”Focusing on what behaviors can actually help is an important first step toward a healthier life, Milkman said. That is especially true in a time when science isn’t at its most popular and influencers often share information not backed by research.You might not know that the research suggests that the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest ways of eating, but you heard from an influencer that cutting out carbs and only eating red meat is key to longevity.If you set a goal of bettering your nutrition but don’t have the information to guide you toward the best path to accomplish it, you might be working against yourself, Milkman said.You may think you know what you need to do to achieve your health goals and are just struggling with implementing the change, Milkman said. But these upcoming results may help you do an even better job working toward increasing your health and longevity.Once you have the information about where you can make improvements to your health, the next step is to define your goal, Milkman said.Most people would say they would like to be healthier, but an effective goal — say one more hour of sleep each night or two sessions of strength training per week — is more specific than that, she added.If you know you want more balanced nutrition, set a goal with the kinds of food you want to incorporate, and then make a realistic plan that covers how many meals or how many days a week you will build them into your routine, Milkman said.“Ideally, those goals even include when you will do it, where you will do it, and how you will get there,” she said.A lot of people get tripped up in the follow-through, so using strategies to keep you on track is critical, Milkman said.In her research, Milkman has found that figuring out a way to make the behavior you’re incorporating instantly gratifying, rewarding and fun helps you look forward to it instead of harboring a sense of dread.One method is temptation bundling, in which you pair your goal behavior with an activity you enjoy –– like watching your favorite TV show while you are on the elliptical, Milkman said.Timing your goal setting with a moment that feels like a “change of chapter” can also be helpful, and those times can include the new year, a birthday or the start of the school year –– whether or not you have kids going to school, Mehr said.“Those new beginnings tend to be moments when we’re more willing to sort of step back and think big picture,” Milkman said. “It is a fresh-start moment in the fall.”","headline":"Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies.

But news media reports, including a New York Times article citing state Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, have said Democrats would stand to gain at least two additional U.S. House seats.California's redistricting plan, which voters must still accept or reject in a special ballot on November 4, is designed to flip five Republican seats to the \n Democrats' column.The redrawn Texas map could yield as many as five more Republican seats, with the party seeking to gain one additional seat each in Missouri and North Carolina. Other Republican states, including Ohio, Kansas and Indiana, are either planning or considering similar moves.The U.S. Senate is considered more of a long shot for Democrats, who will be defending several seats seen as politically vulnerable while trying to win in solidly Republican states to capture a majority.Democrats' redistricting ambitions in Virginia face several hurdles that must be surmounted in short order.Virginia law requires a majority of both houses of the General Assembly to vote in two consecutive sessions - this year and next - to alter the state constitution, then submit the plan to voters for approval in a referendum early next year.Redistricting, the periodic reshaping of political boundaries dividing legislative seats, traditionally is conducted just once a decade following the U.S. Census to account for population shifts.The widening coast-to-coast redistricting scramble, set off by Trump pushing for Texas to redraw its maps this year, is unprecedented in modern U.S. politics.Lawmakers in some states have increasingly redrawn congressional maps to favor one party over another in recent decades, a practice known as gerrymandering. Redistricting in other states, including Virginia and California, however, has been turned over to independent, non-partisan commissions by constitutional amendment.Hence, the need for Virginia and California legislators to approve a constitutional amendment allowing their states to revert to legislature-drawn maps.","headline":"Virginia Democrats weigh plan to counter Trump's redistricting campaign","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/virginia-democrats-weigh-plan-counter-trumps-redistricting-campaign-2025-10-27/","message":"Democratic leaders have summoned Virginia legislators into a special session starting on Monday where they are expected to consider a plan to counter Republicans' intended gains in the U.

But it’s very much their own thing.”“It’s literally the farmer supporting the land, and supporting the state and the nation,” said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian modern and contemporary art at Christie’s. “This is Husain’s way of saying that, while we may be modernizing, post-independence, and entering this new era, it’s very important not to forget that the basis of the country is its rural folk.”Despite the public attention Husain’s later work attracted, his most valuable paintings emerged during this early period, Avari said. “He’s playing this critical role of defining what it is to be an Indian artist in the new country of India, and what Indian modern art really means,” he added. “He’s a linchpin figure in defining this moment.”Husain maintained that he never intended to degrade these deities. His subjects were not the goddesses themselves, but their iconography — how they appeared in temple art, sculptures and friezes. Their nudity was drawn from Indian art history, not his imagination, though the paintings were nonetheless viewed by some critics as a “kind of desacralizing act,” said the University of Oxford’s Gujral.“In Hindu nationalist politics, the bogeyman is the Muslim invader who outrages the modesty of the Hindu woman,” she said. “For a lot of your average Indian viewers who didn’t have an enduring understanding of the nude and its art historical heritage… he becomes the Muslim disrobing the Hindu woman.”“It reignited old ideas of the Muslim taking what isn’t his,” she added. “But the idea for Husain is that this heritage belongs to all of us.”That year, a court in Indore issued an arrest warrant for Husain. The offending image, this time, was a more recent painting that reimagined the map of India as a naked woman on her knees, city names marking her body. The artist publicly apologized for causing offense and denied giving it the name “Bharat Mata” — or Mother India, a personification of the nation — claiming the work was untitled. This did little to appease his critics.Husain spent most of his final years in Dubai, Doha and London. Upon surrendering his Indian passport to apply for Qatari citizenship, he is reported to have said: “India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country. What I have surrendered is just a piece of paper.”He also often spoke of his desire to return home — including to his friend Abhishek Poddar, a prominent collector and founder of Bangalore’s Museum of Art & Photography, who regularly mailed Husain his favorite Indore newspaper. “His love was India, and he always missed India,” said Poddar. “I once said, ‘What is it that you miss? And he said, ‘What I really miss is the earth there. The mud.’”“There would have been at least a dozen occasions when he’s sitting with me and he’s drawing somebody’s portrait,” added Poddar, who holds several Husain works in his museum’s collection.Husain painted anywhere and everywhere. Renowned as a showman, he even painted during live performances and immediately auctioned off the resulting works. Taking commissions from Gulf royals and industrialist billionaires, he was something of an art-world celebrity, his distinctive appearance, designer suits and reputation for walking around shoeless all part of his own icon-building.“He was known as the barefoot artist,” said Avari, the Christie’s specialist. “He made that a thing. He would walk around with this very long paint brush, using it as a cane. There was no mistaking the figure of Husain wherever he went.But if Husain was, to use Poddar’s words, a “brilliant marketing man,” is it plausible that he had attempted to exploit religious outrage to serve his own ends? Gujral described the painter as a “contrarian” who “definitely liked controversy,” though she suggests he would neither have intended nor anticipated the reaction his work provoked. “He was interested in mass images,” she explained.“If there were a pantheon of figures associated with Islam, I don’t think he would have looked at that any differently from the way he looked at Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism or whatever else,” said Poddar.","headline":"Why ‘India’s Picasso’ is breaking auction records – and enraging the Hindu right","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/style/india-mf-husain-art-intl-hnk-dst","message":"Known for bold, colorful explorations of folk and pop culture, Husain was lauded as a pioneer of Indian modernism and often dubbed “India’s Picasso. ” His paintings played with icons in all their forms, from Mother Teresa and Indira Gandhi to Bollywood stars and mythological figures from literary epics. “The reception of Husain is such a good litmus test for Indian cultural politics, because there are times when it wasn’t controversial,” she added, calling the reactions a “way to take the temperature of the country. ”Hailing from an Indian branch of the Sulaymani Bohras, a Muslim sect residing primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, Husain was exposed to both Hindu and Islamic art from a young age."},{"details":"An Italian appeals court in Bologna ordered that the suspect, identified only as Serhii K. under German privacy laws, should be transferred to Germany, confirming a ruling that it had issued last month.The lawyer said that the Supreme Court hearing was expected to take place within about a month, and that the suspect will remain in Italy for the time being.\"The defence reiterates that it will not stop until a court has fully examined the international law and human rights implications of the case,\" lawyer Nicola Canestrini said in a statement.The Ukrainian won a temporary reprieve against transfer earlier this month when the Court of Cassation in Rome, Italy's top court, sent the case back to the appeals court in Bologna for further review.No one has taken responsibility for the blasts and Ukraine has denied any role.

Jackson bought it sight unseen. Despite never having been there, he was ready for a change, so he moved to his new digs in Topeka, the state capital.Next, he painted the house’s exterior in rainbow stripes to make it look like a Pride flag. The act was intentional, agitprop for the social media age. It was a response to the the church’s anti-gay rhetoric, and it was right in front of their living room windows, impossible to ignore.Photos of the home went viral, but Jackson thought people would see a picture, have a laugh, and then move on.A few years later, Jackson bought a second home on the street and painted it in pink, white and blue stripes to resemble the trans pride flag.Jackson doesn’t call the Equality House a “spite” house, but he knows that a lot of people disagree. The house is part of a wider nonprofit he’s established called Planting Peace, which has launched other initiatives including orphanages and elephant rescue efforts.“The Equality House is a symbol of compassion, peace, and positive change,” the organization’s website says. But its location, facing the infamous church, makes a case for its “spite” house label.It’s sometimes mistakenly linked to “nail” houses, where owners refuse to sell to developers, leaving a single structure marooned amid new constructions. Sometimes owners are holding out for a bigger payday. Others stay put out of stubbornness — think of the little house at the beginning of the movie “Up.”But spite houses are different. They’re built not to resist developers but, as their name suggests, they’re intentionally designed, with a degree of malice, to annoy someone specific.Ten feet wide and four stories tall, it rises from the city’s historic North End. According to a real estate agent who once sold it, two brothers owned the plot. One built a grand home for himself while the other was away fighting in the Civil War. When the soldier returned, furious that his brother had left him a smaller portion of the plot, he built a narrow tower to block the mansion’s view and sunlight.Today, a plaque outside the diminutive 44 Hull Street property reads “Skinny House,” with “Spite House” in parentheses. Although it’s still a private residence, it has become a tourist attraction in the tony Boston neighborhood, which also contains the Old North Church, the city’s oldest, and a statue of Paul Revere.On Google Maps, it’s labeled “Boston spite house.” Instagram is full of photos of tourists visiting the house, with “stretching my arms out between this house and the one next door” by far the most popular pose.While spite houses aren’t an exclusively American phenomenon, they do flourish in the United States. The mix of private-property culture, individualism, and the country’s fragmented zoning laws creates ideal conditions for personal grudges to solidify into real estate.“Hostile architecture is very American,” says Paavo Monkkonen, assistant professor in the University of California, Los Angeles’ Department of Urban Planning. “Your house represents more here than it does in other countries. It’s a more personal symbol because it’s a home ownership society. There’s more neighbor-to-neighbor conflict.”Spite houses are a kind of hostile architecture, but usually on a local scale —built for the irritation of a particular person or family. Broader “hostile architecture” includes things like uncomfortable park benches meant to keep homeless people from sleeping on them.“The US approach to urban design is often not people-centric,” says Monkkonen. “In the sense that in certain parts of the city you want to build things that no one will go to, plazas that will be empty, because you want to protect your own peace and quiet.”Today, the structure is home to a traditional Bosnian restaurant, but to locals it will always be the House of Spite or House of Contempt – a moment of David defeating Goliath, and a symbol of Bosnian pride.In New York City’s West Village, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the United States, a small, easily missed corner of pavement has become an unlikely tourist attraction.When a survey showed the city’s measurements of the land were slightly off, the family refused to surrender the remaining two-foot sliver. Instead they tiled their protest into the ground.For Aaron Jackson’s Equality House project, going viral had pros and cons. He was happy that the wave of attention got people to learn about Westboro Baptist Church and educate themselves on LGBT issues.However, it got to the point that he no longer wanted to live in the house day-to-day. Instead, Jackson is converting the home into a museum and library so that people who visit can do more than just take a picture.Some guests, Jackson says, want to show support when they visit the Equality House. Others want to argue. Some consider it a spite house, while others think it’s an activist experiment.","headline":"Saying ‘screw you’ through architecture: America’s spite houses","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/24/travel/spite-houses-hostile-architecture","message":"The Church, which is considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, is best known for organizing pickets at soldiers’ funerals and emblazoning anti-LGBT slogans on protest signs and billboards.

Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.This year, she led a study that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.“It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”Other researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, has successfully grown dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.","headline":"Scientists are racing to grow human teeth in the lab","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/science/lab-grown-human-teeth-spc","message":"It’s not surprising that many people fear the dentist.

The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.“The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”“Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

He made no comment on Turkish involvement.Rubio added that Gaza's future governance still needed to be worked out among Israel and partner nations but could not include Hamas.Rubio later said U.S. officials were receiving input on a possible U.N. resolution or international agreement to authorise the multinational force in Gaza and would discuss the issue in Qatar, a key Gulf mediator on Gaza, on Sunday.\"Israel is aware that Hamas knows where our deceased hostages are, in fact, located.

But for some species, costumes are an everyday essential, and the stakes are much higher than scoring a king-size Snickers bar.Animal mimicry is the evolutionary process in which one species develops the ability to resemble another to gain a survival advantage. Mimicry can take all shapes and sizes, and, just like Halloween costumes, success can vary.In the spirit of the season, we’ve rounded up some of the best costumes in the animal world. Each category highlights a different form of visual mimicry. And we’d like your help determining the winners.Sometimes a harmless species will mimic a dangerous species, or prey will make itself look suddenly unappetizing. It’s a survival strategy called Batesian mimicry, and these are some of its cleverest practitioners.Cheetah cubs, before gaining all their speed and ferocity, rely on mimicry to stay safe in the savanna. The lighter fur along their backs, paired with darker fur on their bellies, can make them appear like a mammal no one wants to mess with: the honey badger.These tiger moths (Sphecosoma cognata) have perfected their wasp costumes to the point where wasps themselves sometimes get confused. One key accessory is their translucent wings, which are fairly uncommon in moths.These species may look friendly, but proceed with caution. Aggressive mimicry is when a harmful species or predator will mimic a harmless species, often to lure unsuspecting prey.The alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) might run into some challenges trying to catch a fast-moving fish. So this species employs lingual luring to attract its favored meal. Its tongue looks like a worm and can bring fish within striking distance, without any need for a chase.The fang blenny (Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos) mimics the appearance and dance of a cleaner wrasse, which tends to be tolerated by larger fish because of its ability to clean parasites off their scales. But a blenny uses its sneaky sharp lower teeth to go directly after big fish.Sometimes it’s a plus when everyone shows up wearing the same costume. Müllerian mimicry is when distinct species evolve to display similar warning signals, broadcasting that potential predators should stay away from all creatures with that look.The mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) has the same bright colors and bold patterns of other poisonous frog species found in eastern Peru, such as Ranitomeya fantastica and Ranitomeya variabilis. Almost as if eating Halloween candy granted superpowers, these frogs derive their toxicity from a diet of ants and mites.Heliconius butterflies are a diverse group of butterflies with splashes of color on black wings. DNA analysis has helped determine that some of them that fly together are actually different species that have converged in their wing patterns, warning predators of their bitter taste. “Not only do they look identical,” said Owen McMillan, a staff scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, but, over successive generations, “when one changes to look like another, the other changes in the same way.”These animals aren’t out to gain attention for their costumes. They’d prefer if you didn’t notice them at all, harnessing the power of camouflage to expertly blend into their environments.This giant stick bug (Acrophylla alta) is potentially the heaviest insect in Australia and also the newest discovered species of our contest, first described in February. You might be wondering how the biggest bug down south could go undiscovered for so long? Because they look like a stick and also live in very tall trees.It’s sort of like showing up in a costume that is so last year. Animal mimicry can lose its survival advantages when the model for that look disappears.The non-poisonous king snake evolved to mimic the color patterns of the poisonous coral snake. But in some areas — such as the North Carolina Sandhills — coral snakes are gone and predators no longer need to worry about avoiding the mimic.The white-tailed jackrabbit uses seasonal camouflage: a brown fur coat in the warmer months, a white one in the winter. But as climate change reduces snowfall in many regions, white hares stand out starkly against brown landscapes, making them easy targets for predators. Their once-perfect costume has become a liability in a rapidly changing environment.Some animals use multiple types of mimicry to fool and surprise. As some species grow, their costumes change to mimic different species entirely, and some have multiple costumes from which to switch given the environment around them. Their survival depends on their versatility.The mimic octopus (Thaumoctopus mimicus) is the only species in our contest that employs dynamic mimicry, or the ability to shift between different Batesian imitations to appear more dangerous depending on what, or who, is around. It can stretch its arms to appear snake-like, or form a flat, tapered shape reminiscent of a banded sole. It’s also known to splay its arms in all directions to mimic the spines of the invasive and toxic lionfish.The spicebush swallowtail caterpillar also doesn’t have just one costume — it has a whole mimicry wardrobe. As a young caterpillar, it mimics bird droppings with a dark, shiny and bumpy appearance. As it ages, the costume gets scarier, developing fake eyespots that mimic a juvenile green snake. Even its chrysalis takes on a mottled brown appearance that looks just like a curled dead leaf or broken twig, staying undercover until it’s ready for its final reveal as a butterfly.Survival often relies on deception, and now you’ve had your say. Whether you voted for the cheetah cub’s badger outfit or the stick bug’s expert disguise, it’s clear that these contestants, win or lose, have honed genetic adaptations far more impressive than anything we’ll see this October.Design, development and illustrations by Hailey Haymond.

While it gives the elephants a powerful and distinctive appearance, it also makes them vulnerable to poaching.Most of the surviving super tuskers, also known as “great tuskers,” are found in southern Kenya, where Italian-born photographer Federico Veronesi has spent years tracking and photographing them. His new book, “Walk the Earth,” the culmination of years of work in Kenya and beyond, pays tribute to the elephants he calls “the last witnesses of a world before humans took over the Earth.”As a child growing up in Italy, Veronesi was captivated by African wildlife. That fascination led him to Kenya, where he eventually settled and began photographing the animals he had admired for so long.“Photography is almost like a medium through which I get to stay among the animals and express my love for them,” said Veronesi.Elephants became his central focus, not just for their grandeur, but for the way they seemed to embody the soul of Africa for him. “When you see an elephant walking through a savanna,” he reflected, “it’s so evocative, like everything about Africa is in that one scene.”“We were waiting as the elephants made their daily walk from the woodlands to the marsh,” he remembered, “when this massive bull appeared with tusks so long, they nearly touched the ground.”“Through the book I also wanted to show different aspects of elephants’ lives,” Veronesi said, “such as courtship with Tim, fighting, mud-bathing, swimming, reaching up for branches and social relationships.”Veronesi also sought to highlight the diversity of habitats where elephants live across Africa, from the deserts of Namibia to the Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater and Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe.Veronesi’s favorite image is one of Balguda, “probably the greatest tusker alive at the moment,” as described in his book. Balguda was only known from occasional sightings during aerial patrols and Veronesi spent years looking for him.“Walk the Earth” is Veronesi’s third photography book, and he has been working on it for the past five years. It highlights the threats elephants face today: habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and the continued danger of trophy hunting, especially for the few remaining great tuskers.Veronesi has long used his photography to help protect wildlife. He says he donates images to conservation organizations, contributes to awareness campaigns and has spoken internationally, including in China, where he presented his wildlife photos to raise awareness about ivory demand.Veronesi strives to not only document elephants as specimens, but to portray them as individuals. “The goal is always to make the viewer connect with the animal, to look into its soul somehow,” he said.That connection requires patience and perspective. He often positions his camera low to the ground, so the elephant seems to tower over the frame. Many of his most powerful images are in black and white.“Elephants have this incredible aura of calm patience,” he said. “They convey a sense of wisdom, of knowledge. And at the same time, they’re extremely social and caring for each other.","headline":"Stunning images spotlight vanishing ‘super tusker’ elephants","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/super-tusker-elephant-photos-federico-veronesi-spc","message":"This rare trait is the result of a genetic variation that causes the tusks to grow faster and longer than usual.

Voigt meanwhile made a surprise return to the pageant as a host for the official online broadcast, having co-hosted one of the preliminary competitions on Wednesday.Her resignation letter, later seen by CNN, alleged a “toxic work environment” that “at best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.” Voigt also claimed the pageant’s organizers had failed to provide an “effective handler,” resulting in her being sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Florida while alone with an unnamed person in a car. Miss USA’s then president, Laylah Rose, has consistently denied allegations of wrongdoing.The Miss Universe Organization later issued a statement confirming Brodeur’s acquisition, calling it a “new chapter” in the pageant’s “storied history.” Miss Universe’s co-owner JKN Global Group then filed a lawsuit against Rose’s company VVV Global, alleging the firm had breached its contract and brought the Miss USA brand “into disrepute.” The suit also reiterated Voigt’s earlier claims, while accusing Rose of “mistreating pageant contestants, winners, staff and volunteers.”About a week after JKN’s complaint was filed, Brodeur wrote on Instagram that he had “officially regained access” to Miss USA’s social media accounts.

But identifying fossils in an area accurately dated to just before the extinction event is rare.A key site of interest for paleontologists has been the well-studied Hell Creek and Fort Union Formations, located in what is now Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.Hell Creek has preserved evidence of multiple species of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, as well as rocks, dated to the end of the Cretaceous Period, or just before the dinosaurs went extinct. But the dinosaur community there completely lacked any long-necked species, causing scientists to wonder if those had already disappeared.Now, new research has dated rocks in the Naashoibito Member to the same time period as the Hell Creek Formation, revealing what kinds of dinosaurs lived in different parts of North America just a few hundred thousand years before going extinct.Among the dinosaurs that lived in the Naashoibito Member was Alamosaurus, one of the largest long-necked dinosaurs that ever lived, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.“What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,” lead study author Andrew Flynn, assistant professor in the department of geological sciences at New Mexico State University, said in a statement. “They’re doing great, they’re thriving, and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.”But dating the rock layers containing the fossils is more complicated, Flynn said. First, the layers need to be exposed so they can be studied, and then the rocks themselves must be dated.Dinosaur eggs from China found to be around 86 million years old, according to ‘atomic clock’ dating“Species might have failed to enter the fossil record, they might have been preserved as fossils but not yet discovered, or they might have been discovered but lack essential context, such as precise estimates of geological age,” wrote Dr. Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a related article published with the research. Zanno was not involved in the study.The Naashoibito Member site is problematic because erosion has stripped it of the perfect layers of rock found at other sites in North America, making it difficult to determine when the layers were created, Flynn said.One way the team was able to date the rocks was by comparing the samples with Earth’s magnetic field, which periodically changes direction.For instance, right now, magnetic north aligns with the direction of north. But sometimes, magnetic north can align with the direction of south. Scientists have a clear understanding of when these reversals have occurred over time. By measuring the direction of the magnetic field when the rock layers were created, researchers can narrow down the time frame.“The end-Cretaceous mass extinction, fortunately for us, took place during a relatively short period of reversed polarity, which makes it much easier to say what our data correlates to,” Flynn said.The team also used radiometric dating — or measuring the decay of certain elements in rocks to determine their ages — on sand grains from sandstone in the Naashoibito Member.The new study paints a portrait of two very different dinosaur communities divided between the north and south regions of the continent.Both areas had dinosaurs in common, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Torosaurus. Fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs were also found at each location, but they belonged to different groups. There were no giant, long-necked sauropods to be found in the north, which for a long time led some paleontologists to think that after millions of years of pushing the boundaries of evolution with their humongous sizes, they had gone extinct, said study coauthor Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.“I can imagine the scene, one minute a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid,” Brusatte said.Part of the reason for the differing groups divided between north and south was likely due to climate conditions, Flynn said.The Naashoibito Member site was like a warm and humid tropical forest, similar to conditions in modern Panama, while the Hell Creek area was at a much lower elevation and included the cooler conditions of an inland sea coastal plain.The new evidence about diverse, late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is exciting, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the School of Earth Sciences at the UK’s University of Bristol. Benton was not involved in the new study, and his previous research has suggested a decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid strike.“However, this is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world,” Benton wrote in an email.But Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor within the department of Earth, energy, and environment at the University of Calgary, said she﻿ believes the new findings could change how researchers think about dinosaurs in North America before the mass extinction event.Zelenitsky was not involved in the new research, but her team’s ongoing work in Alberta uncovering fossil eggshells linked to diverse dinosaur species aligns with the findings about stable dinosaur populations.“The research team uncovered compelling new evidence (…) that dinosaurs were still going strong ‘til the very end,” Zelenitsky wrote in an email.The new study may focus on dinosaurs, but the fact that 75% of species on Earth disappeared at the same time contains a lesson that remains applicable today, Brusatte said.“Sudden climate and environmental change can catch animals and ecosystems unaware,” he said, “and can defeat even the strongest and most iconic of species.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

The move comes just weeks after US soybean farmers blasted a separate deal with Argentina that they fear will give South American producers a competitive edge in that market.But Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle farmer and the senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan farm organization, said: “If Trump goes through with what he outlined, I do believe it’s a betrayal of the American rancher. It’s a feeling that you’re selling us out to a foreign competitor.”“It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” he added.In a statement, Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade association for beef producers, said the organization and its members “cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.”Becca Jablonski, an agricultural economist who teaches at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Business, said the price increase is fueled by multiple factors.A recent, multi-year drought decreased the amount of grazing land for cattle and made feed grain significantly more expensive, resulting in a shortage of cattle, she said.The shortage has also been made worse by an infestation of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, just across the border in Mexico, significantly curtailing beef imports from that country.Jablonski said that historically the livestock sector barely makes money, but is having a rare positive year, which allows farmers to pay down debts they accrued during unprofitable years.In a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the president is keeping his promises to defend farmers and consumers.“President Trump pledged to protect America’s ranchers and deliver economic relief for everyday Americans. The Administration is accomplishing both by expanding beef imports from Argentina to lower consumer prices in the short term while rolling out a new USDA initiative that will support ranchers and expand cattle herd sizes to keep prices lower in the long term,” Kelly said.“It is not uncommon for folks in farming to have a year where they report a loss,” he said. “You cannot look at cattle producers that had one good year and say, ‘Oh my gosh, they are just making out like bandits.’”Lovell blamed price increases on the large meatpacking corporations that buy product from US ranchers and package it for grocery stores.An influx of imported beef would hurt US farmers, he said, because the large meat packers are not required to label what country their beef comes from.But soybean farmers were among the first to feel the pain of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs with China. Since May, China has effectively boycotted American soybeans as a response to Trump’s tariffs.John Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer and the founder of The National Black Farmers Association, said he had never had a problem selling his soybeans until recently.“Now nobody’s buying it,” Boyd said. “The largest purchaser of our soybeans was China, and they haven’t placed any orders. Zero.”“The president thinks his tariffs are the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s putting America’s farmers out of business,” he added.A text message, seen by CNN, sent by Secretary Rollins to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that Argentina then used that financial lifeline to strike a deal with China on soybeans.“We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said.“Here we are losing our farms, and the president is helping out a foreign country,” Boyd said of the deal.Earlier this month, sources told CNN the White House was planning to extend a multibillion-dollar bailout for farmers. With the government shutdown stretching past its third week, no plan has materialized yet.Although the USDA has been largely shuttered during the government shutdown, the agency on Wednesday announced a plan it said would “strengthen the American beef industry.”The plan includes expanding ranchers’ access to federal land for grazing and prioritizing grant applications from military veterans looking to enter the industry, among other measures.Lovell said that while the plan may be welcome news to many farmers, he felt it didn’t go far enough to protect the industry.“What US ranchers need is a fair market with the right incentives. We’ve got to encourage rebuilding the cow herd here in the US,” he said.  “This seems to be a quick attempt to control the damage.”","headline":"Trump’s Argentina beef deal angers America’s struggling farmers: ‘You’re selling us out’","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/trump-argentina-beef-deal-farmer-impact","message":"Trump is facing criticism from many US cattle ranchers after signaling support for increasing low-tariff beef imports from Argentina to ease record beef prices in the United States.

The package includes historic reductions to America’s safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and food stamps, and at the same time slashes taxes, resulting “in a massive transfer” of resources from the poorest households to the richest.Higher pension levels, better child allowances and minimum wage legislation also have a “statistically measurable impact” in reducing the likelihood of a vote for the far right.“Thousands of people in poverty I speak with tell me they feel stigmatized and monitored rather than supported,” De Schutter said. “Unless social protection is taken seriously as a human right, far-right populists will continue to reap what has been sown.”","headline":"Welfare cuts are fueling the rise of the far right globally, the UN finds","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/22/business/welfare-cuts-fuel-rise-far-right-intl","message":"Cuts to social protection for people living in poverty have created “fertile ground” for far-right movements around the world, according to a United Nations report.
