[{"details":"After weeks, months, years and even decades of scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.Unlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself.It's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.The sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.All that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.After more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.It makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.This announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.But it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.And the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"For the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years, the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.Andrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.A few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.There might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story, people might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.Who knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?But this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King.While other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.There seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged, showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.It no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.Instead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.It's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.Parliamentary committee demands answers about whether the lease arrangements are \"achieving the best value for money\".","headline":"Is this finally rock bottom for Mr Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62elnjnqqxo","message":"After weeks, months, years and even decades of scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed.

A day later a senior UN official said the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.\"We left el-Fasher four days ago. The suffering we encountered on the way was unimaginable,\" Ezzeldin says.\"We were divided into groups and beaten. The scenes were extremely brutal. We saw people murdered in front of us. We saw people being beaten. It was really terrible.\"I myself was hit on the head, back, and legs. They beat me with sticks. They wanted to execute us completely. But when the opportunity arose, we ran, while others in front were detained.\"Ezzeldin says he joined a group of escapees who took shelter in a building, moving by night and sometimes literally crawling along the ground in an effort to remain hidden.\"Our belongings were stolen,\" he says. \"Phones, clothes - everything. Literally, even my shoes were stolen. Nothing was left.\"We went without food for three days while walking in the streets. By God's mercy, we made it through.\"Those in Tawila told the BBC that men making the journey were particularly likely to be subjected to scrutiny by the RSF, with fighters targeting anyone suspected of being a soldier.A freelance journalist based in Tawila, working for the BBC, has conducted among the first interviews with some of those who made the journey.He says his eye was injured in an artillery strike, and he left the city on Sunday after receiving treatment in hospital.\"Four of them - they killed them in front of us. Beat them and killed them,\" he says, adding that he was shot three times.Ahmed describes how the fighters demanded to see the phones of the three who were left alive and went through them, searching their messages.In the next tent in the clinic run by medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Yusra Ibrahim Mohamed describes making the decision to flee the city after her husband, a soldier with the Sudanese army, was killed.\"My husband was in the artillery,\" she says. \"He was returning home and was killed during the attacks.\"We left three days ago,\" she says, \"moving in different directions from the artillery areas. The people guiding us didn't know what was happening.\"If someone resisted, they were beaten or robbed. They would take everything you had. People could even be executed. I saw dead bodies in the streets.\"\"So they are really suffering a lot. And we are trying to just give them some support and some medical care.\"Those arriving this week in Tawila join hundreds of thousands there who fled previous rounds of violence in el-Fasher.Those trapped inside were bombarded by a barrage of deadly artillery and air strikes as the army and the paramilitaries battled for el-Fasher.Hundreds of thousands were displaced in April when the RSF seized control of the Zamzam camp close to the city, at the time one of the main sites housing people forced to flee fighting elsewhere.Some experts have expressed concern at the relatively low numbers arriving at places like Tawila now.\"This is actually a point of worry for us,\" says Caroline Bouvoir, who works with refugees in neighbouring Chad for the aid agency Solidarités International\"We see the conditions that those who have arrived are in. They are highly malnourished, highly dehydrated, or sick or injured, and they are clearly traumatised with what they have seen either in the city or on the road.\"We believe that many people are stuck currently in different locations between Tawila and el-Fasher, and unable to move forward - either because of their physical condition or because of the insecurity on the road, where militias are unfortunately attacking people who are trying to find safe haven.\"For Ezzeldin the relief of having reached safety is tempered by the fears for those still behind him on the journey.\"My message is that public roads should be secured for citizens,\" he pleads, \"or humanitarian aid sent to the streets.Opposition supporters are angry that the president's main challengers are in jail or have been disqualified.WHO chief \"appalled and deeply shocked\" after doctors say RSF killed \"patients, their companions, and anyone else present\".RSF troops executed a number of unarmed people after seizing el-Fasher, videos reviewed by BBC Verify show.","headline":"'We saw people murdered in front of us': Sudan siege survivors speak to the BBC","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr4qqgdlkjo","message":"Shaken, scratched and left with just the clothes he is wearing, Ezzeldin Hassan Musa describes the brutality of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the wake of the paramilitary group taking control of el-Fasher city in the Darfur region.

In this context, it is difficult to estimate the number of civilians killed. Despite commitments to protect civilians, the reality is that no one is safe in el-Fasher,” she said. “There is no safe passage for civilians to leave the city.”Residents in the city were being subjected to “horrors” the United Nations’ humanitarian chief said.The city was “already the scene of catastrophic levels of human suffering, [but] has descended into an even darker hell,” Tom Fletcher told the UN Security Council.There were “credible reports of widespread executions after Rapid Support Forces fighters entered the city”, Fletcher said.“We cannot hear the screams, but – as we sit here today – the horror is continuing. Women and girls are being raped, people [are] being mutilated and killed with utter impunity.”“There was a lot of shelling,” Fatima Abdulrahman, a woman displaced from el-Fasher, told Al Jazeera from Tawila. “I myself have been affected by shells. Shelling killed my daughter, injured my other daughter’s eye and paralysed my son. My body is full of wounds and is swollen.”“Shelling and drone attacks were happening all the time,” Aisha Ismael, a woman displaced from el-Fasher, told Al Jazeera from Tawila. “They hit us with the backs of their rifles day and night unless we hid in the houses.”Aid workers in Tawila fear conditions in the region will deteriorate as more internally displaced persons arrive from el-Fasher and food and medical supplies continue to dwindle.“The conditions are catastrophic, as we’ve been hearing,” Mary Brace, technical protection advisor for Nonviolent Peaceforce, told Al Jazeera. “The conflict is ongoing, and there is no guarantee of safe passage for civilians as they try to come towards Tawila.”Aid workers’ immediate concerns are providing those fleeing el-Fasher with food, water and emergency medical attention.“The last months have been absolutely harrowing,” Brace told Al Jazeera. “People were talking about just the extreme fear of constant bombardment. The numbers of displaced people here, it’s just absolutely astounding. There’s just extreme levels of trauma.”In a grim speech to the UN Security Council, Al-Harith Mohamed called the events unfolding in el-Fasher a “genocide by all legal standards and definitions”.“Women and girls are attacked in broad daylight,” he said, adding that Sudan is wondering “Where is the Security Council?”The Sudanese ambassador called on the UN to condemn the RSF’s actions and designate the group as a “terrorist” organisation, demand the paramilitary group leave el-Fasher, enforce a year-old arms embargo related to the conflict, and sanction any outside forces supporting the RSF.Last year, the UN called on countries to stop supplying weapons to parties in the conflict in Sudan. A Security Council committee previously also sanctioned two generals from the RSF for destabilising the country through violence and human rights abuses.","headline":"UN officials condemn ‘horrifying’ mass killings in Sudan as RSF advances","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/un-officials-condemn-horrifying-mass-killings-in-sudan-as-rsf-advances","message":"United Nations officials have condemned mass killings by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s el-Fasher and warned the UN Security Council that the city has “descended into an even darker hell”.

Andrew has always denied the claims.Reacting to the latest developments, Ms Giuffre's family said she \"brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage\". Giuffre took her own life earlier this year.In its statement, the Palace said the King \"has today initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of Prince Andrew\".As well as the title, the Palace said \"formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease\" on Royal Lodge.He will be moved into private accommodation in Sandringham Estate, which is understood to be privately funded by King Charles.\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the statement continued.Andrew's two adult daughters, Eugenie and Beatrice, will retain their titles as princesses and Andrew is still eighth in line for the throne.It is understood that Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, will also move out of Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.Until this month, she kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York - but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew voluntarily gave up the usage of the Duke of York title.It is understood that the government was consulted on the decision to strip Andrew of his prince title, and made clear it supported the decision.Reacting to the news on BBC Question Time, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it sent a \"very powerful message to the victims of grooming and sex offences\".\"This is a huge development and a big step for the King to take. I have to say, just, you know, as an initial response, I really support the step that he's taken.\"The scandal over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was reignited by sexual abuse allegations in Ms Giuffre's memoir.Details about Andrew's living arrangements have also come under the spotlight, with fresh questions being asked in recent days about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.Last week, more details emerged about how he could afford his mansion, after the lease agreement was revealed.The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a lease document seen by BBC News confirms.The deal meant that instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.For the Palace, Thursday's announcement is an attempt to draw a line under the scandals surrounding the former Prince Andrew - now simply Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.Parliamentary committee demands answers about whether the lease arrangements are \"achieving the best value for money\".Priests placed garlands of flowers around the necks of the royal couple when they arrived at the west London temple.Shaun and Sophie Oceans chatted to King Charles about their cocktail bar on his Staffordshire visit.","headline":"Andrew stripped of 'prince' title and will move out of Royal Lodge","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7m4yjkp74o","message":"Prince Andrew is to lose his 'prince' title and leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Unable to cope, her birth mother placed her in an orphanage in the South Korean capital, Seoul.Shirley grew up living a life similar to that of many young Americans. She went to school, got her driving licence and worked as a bartender.Shirley had children, got married and became a piano teacher. Life carried on for decades with no reason to doubt her American identity.She lost her Social Security card and needed a replacement. But when she went to her local Social Security office, Shirley was told she needed to prove her status in the country. Eventually she found out she did not have US citizenship.The reasons why so many US adoptees do not have citizenship are varied. Shirley blames her parents for failing to finalise the correct paperwork when she came to the US. She also blames the school system and the government for not highlighting that she did not have citizenship.\"I blame all the adults in my life that literally just dropped the ball and said: 'She's here in America now, she's going to be fine.'\"\"I settled into my life, always understanding that I was an American citizen. That's what I was told. I still believe that today,\" she says.\"I personally don't categorise myself as an immigrant. I didn't come here as an immigrant with a second language, a different culture, family members, ties to a country that I was born in… my culture was erased,\" she says.\"You are told that you have these rights as an American - to vote and to participate in democracy, to work, to go to school, to raise your family, to have freedoms - all these things that Americans have.\"And then all of a sudden they started pushing us into a category of immigrants, simply because they cut us from legislation. We should have all equally had citizenship rights because that was promised through adoption policies.\"For decades, intercountry adoptions approved by courts and government agencies did not automatically guarantee US citizenship. Adoptive parents sometimes failed to secure legal status or naturalised citizenship for their children.Advocates have been pushing for Congress to remove the age cut-off but these bills have failed to make it past the House.Some, like Debbie Principe, whose two adopted children have special needs, have spent decades trying to secure citizenship for their dependents.\"We'll just be lucky if they don't get picked up and deported to another country that isn't even their country of origin,\" Ms Principe said.Those fears for adoptees and their families have risen even further since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a vow to remove \"promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal law\".While many Americans support deportations of illegal migrants, there has been uproar over some incidents.Adoptee rights groups say they have been flooded with requests for help since Trump's return and some adoptees have gone into hiding.\"At the end of the day, they don't care about your back story. They don't care that you're legally here and it's just a paperwork error. I always tell people this one single piece of paper has essentially just ruined my life,\" she said.Despite adoptees being left in limbo for decades, Emily Howe, a civil and human rights attorney who has worked with adoptees across the US, believes it is just a case of political will that should unite people from across the political spectrum.\"It should be a straightforward fix: adopted children should be equal to their biological siblings of parents who were US citizens at the time of birth,\" Ms Howe said.\"These are people who literally were promised that they were going to be Americans when they were two years old.\"Shirley wishes she could get the US president into a room, so she and others like her could explain their stories.\"We were put on planes as little itty-bitty babies.

The philosophy of consumption policy also seems to have shifted from almost supply-centric to supply-and-demand balanced,\" Citi analysts said in a note.Structural imbalances have certainly deepened amid China's property market crisis and a trade war with Washington.This week, the Communist Party leadership pledged to \"reasonably raise the proportion of public service expenditure in fiscal spending to enhance residents' consumption capacity.\"They pledged to step up consumer-focused policies, improve income distribution to boost household income, and increase the central government's share of social spending to better support households.\"China's next five-year plan will give more prominence to households and consumption than ever before,\" Andrew Batson, China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, said.The five-year plan recommendations reaffirmed last week's official remarks that China will increase the proportion of government investment for people's livelihoods and raise the percentage of household consumption of GDP \"significantly\" over the next five years.\"The allocation of resources will shift more towards consumption, as large-scale expansion of traditional industries and infrastructure has reached its limit,\" said a policy adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Future investment will focus on high-tech industries and new infrastructure.\"China may aim to increase the household consumption rate by about 5 percentage points over the next five years, but policy advisers say it is unclear whether the government will set a specific target in the upcoming five-year plan.Attempts to boost consumption and related reforms over the past decade have been slow to take root in the real economy. Consumer confidence has remained low because of inadequate social welfare, slowing income growth and a property crisis that has eroded household wealth. The services sector has also taken time to develop.Analysts and investors are watching for measures that redirect funds and resources from businesses and government investment to households, which will be crucial for unlocking consumer demand.Alongside the consumption focus, the leadership reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a reasonable manufacturing share in the economy, prioritising emerging industries such as new energy, aerospace and advanced materials. Manufacturing accounts for around a quarter of GDP.The full five-year plan, with detailed economic targets, will be released at the annual parliament meeting in March.Capital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard said that fiscal policy will be key to boosting consumption, and the share of fiscal spending on investment - now at a three-decade high - could decline in the coming years.The government spends over 6% of GDP annually on investment, excluding significant funding from quasi-fiscal agencies like local government financing vehicles and policy banks, he said.\"But the wider policy agenda will limit how quickly this happens, and it will take a long time for the imbalances in China's economy to be fully addressed,\" he said.President Xi Jinping, in remarks published on Tuesday, underscored the focus on boosting consumption, citing \"increasing downward pressure on the economy and insufficient effective demand.\"China's economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in a year in the third quarter as soft domestic demand left it reliant on exports amid U.S. tariffs. Economists are increasingly calling for social welfare and other reforms to address supply-demand imbalances and persistent deflation.\"Whenever we face international economic instability, we always rely on the domestic economy to respond to 'black swan' events,\" Yang Ping, head of the investment institute of the National Development and Reform Commission, the state planner, told reporters on Monday.\"We will promote a significant increase in the consumption rate through income distribution reform and other measures.\"","headline":"China signals sharper pivot to consumption as imbalances worsen","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-signals-sharper-pivot-consumption-imbalances-worsen-2025-10-30/","message":"Chinese leaders are signalling a sharper shift towards supporting consumption over the next five years as limited investment room and slowing exports have exposed vulnerabilities, though measures may take time to yield results. \"The suggestion explicitly pledged to raise the consumption share in GDP.

These do not carry an actual nuclear warhead [but likely a dummy], nor do they create a nuclear explosion,” he said.“The US already tests its own missiles periodically, both existing ones and ones in development, often splashing down in the Pacific. It does announce them but tends not to make a big deal of it, like North Korea and Russia,” he said.Trump, meanwhile, has called for the “total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme and says he does not want Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon. In June, the US and Israel also carried out air strikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities in part to slow its progress.Tehran has maintained that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only, and it has never carried out a nuclear test, according to the Carnegie Endowment’s Panda.“Iran has never done any nuclear tests. They’ve constantly been saying they are not intending to make a nuclear bomb,” Panda told Al Jazeera. “The only thing that Iran has which might be taken seriously is some highly enriched uranium.

The area in southern Gaza is under the control of the Israeli military.According to Netanyahu, Hamas had broken the agreement's clause pertaining to the return of hostage remains.Hamas denied any involvement in the deadly shooting and, in turn, accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal.“If Hamas continues to blatantly violate the ceasefire, it will experience powerful strikes, as it did the day before yesterday and yesterday,” Netanyahu said Thursday during a graduation ceremony for military commanders in southern Israel.“At the end of the day, Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised. If foreign forces do this, all the better. And if they don’t, we will do it.”Reports say the guarantors of the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza told Hamas that Israel will begin military operations on targets inside the Israeli-occupied zone of the Palestinian territory and that they will not protest after a deadline for militants to leave the area expired Thursday.","headline":"Israel receives remains of two more hostages returned by Hamas","level":"euronews","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/10/31/israel-receives-remains-of-two-more-hostages-returned-by-hamas","message":"The Cube is a team of specialist social media journalists who find, verify and debunk the biggest stories in real-time.

But the leader of one global powerhouse is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump.The US president flew out of South Korea Thursday, moments after his landmark meeting with his Chinese counterpart that appeared to de-escalate the protracted trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies.With Trump choosing to skip the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation – which groups together countries accounting for more than half of global trade – Xi steps into the limelight and will hold high-profile meetings, including with Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi and Canada’s Mark Carney.Despite his absence, Trump’s protectionist trade policies and punishing global tariffs loom over the two-day event in the city of Gyeongju. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is standing in for Trump during the discussions.“The world is undergoing rapid changes unseen in a century,” Xi told the forum. “The more turbulent the times are, the more we must stand together in solidarity.”Decisions made in Gyeongju are non-binding — and leaders have faced difficulty reaching consensus in the past including on thorny issues like Russia’s war in Ukraine. But a major focus for the forum this year is on strengthening supply chains and encouraging cooperation as economies worldwide reel from Trump’s tariff offensive.“We are standing at a critical inflection point with a rapidly changing global economic order,” South Korean president and APEC chair Lee Jae Myung said in his address to the summit Friday. “As the free trade order undergoes dramatic changes, global economic uncertainty is deepening, and trade and investment are losing momentum.”Trump’s three-leg tour of Asia, which stopped in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, was generally regarded as a success for all parties, with Asian leaders putting on a masterclass in hospitality and flattery as they sought to get the president on side — and ease trade negotiations in the process.In Japan, Trump and freshly appointed Prime Minister Takaichi embarked on a “new golden age” of relations and signed a critical minerals agreement. And a new trade deal reached with Lee would see South Korea invest billions of dollars in the US, including in shipbuilding, aerospace and technology, according to the White House.On Friday, Xi is expected to hold talks with Japan’s Takaichi, a staunch conservative who has criticized China’s growing military presence in the region and called for cooperation with Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. Takaichi faces a tough balancing act in her meeting with Xi. China remains Japan’s largest trading partner and Takaichi inherited a country facing mounting economic woes.Xi is also expected to meet Carney, who is involved in an escalating trade war with Trump, and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.In comments that echoed Xi and Lee’s addresses to APEC, Carney told the forum that the world was “facing another hinge moment in history.”“Our world is undergoing one of the most profound shifts since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. “That old world… of steady expansion of liberalized trade and investment… that world is gone.”Canada, he said, was aiming to double non-US exports over the next decade in an effort to diversify away from the US.","headline":"China’s Xi in the limelight at Pacific summit with Trump conspicuous by his absence","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/apec-summit-xi-trump-intl-hnk","message":"Leaders of Pacific countries and territories, including China’s Xi Jinping, are gathering in South Korea for a major summit Friday.

And following this logic, the Balkans should belong to Russia’s sphere.”“Trump is very much interested in authoritarianism. In Europe, he likes ‘strongmen’ like Orban or (Slovak PM Robert) Fico,” Bindenagel said.Trump accepts the argument that EU enlargement strengthens Europe and weakens Russian President Vladimir Putin, he added. “But here’s the point: Trump doesn’t want to weaken Putin.”The only place where EU enlargement got somewhat special attention from the Trump administration is Ukraine.The candidate country against which Russia unleashed a full-scale war more than three years ago is still fighting for its very survival as an independent country.While he has acknowledged Ukraine’s strategic importance and its European orientation, Trump has not publicly laid out a position specifically stating whether he supports or opposes Ukraine’s membership in the EU.Still, a report by Bloomberg published in August suggested President Trump raised the issue of Ukraine's membership with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and asked about the reason behind his opposition to Kyiv's candidacy.“You (Ukraine) can forget about NATO,” Trump said at a cabinet meeting in February. “I think that’s probably the reason the whole thing started.”With the doors to NATO shut, Ukrainians could see joining the EU as an important “consolation prize” still relevant in the context of security guarantees.Deepening their security ties to EU members could indeed strengthen Ukraine’s ability to push back against Moscow’s imperialist project, Lokker said.“The Kremlin will need to think twice about attacking a country protected by the bloc’s mutual defense clause, especially given the massive rearmament now underway within the European Union,” he added.Helping to advance Ukrainian membership may be an attractive way for Washington to satisfy Kyiv’s persistent demands for security guarantees while simultaneously reducing its own share of the burden of European security.As the largest accession country - and with the US now holding a significant economic stake in its mineral sector - Ukraine’s economic success would bring substantial benefits to Washington.Advancing Ukraine’s EU integration would support that effort by unlocking significant funding to help transform its economy.According to Bindenagel, Trump sees Ukraine as part of a war with Russia that he desperately wants to end – but only to be celebrated as a peacemaker later on.The failed US-Russian summit in Alaska in the summer as well as the overhyped Trump-Putin meeting in Budapest that was eventually scrapped are a testament to that.“Trump is hard to read on this, because he doesn’t have a clear strategy,” Lokker said. “Just look at all the reversals on Ukraine since he took office.”","headline":"Spoiler or supporter?

Before she departed for the summit on Thursday, Takaichi told reporters that arrangements were underway to meet Xi.While relations between the historic rivals have been on a sounder footing in recent years, Takaichi's surprise elevation to become Japan's first female leader may strain ties due to her nationalistic views and hawkish security policies.One of her first acts since taking office last week was to accelerate a military build-up aimed at deterring the territorial ambitions of an increasingly assertive China in East Asia. Japan also hosts the biggest concentration of U.S. military abroad.The detention of Japanese nationals in China and Beijing's import restrictions on Japanese beef, seafood and agricultural products are also likely to be among sensitive issues on the agenda.Embroiled in a bitter trade dispute with the United States, Canada's biggest trading partner, Carney told a gathering of executives running parallel to the main summit on Friday that Ottawa aimed to double its non-U.S. exports over the next decade.Under the leadership of Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau, Canadians were detained and executed by the Chinese government and Canada's security authorities concluded that China interfered in at least two federal elections. Xi also publicly scolded Trudeau, alleging he leaked their discussions to the press.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is also due to meet Xi in the afternoon, Bangkok said, fresh from signing an enhanced ceasefire deal with neighbouring Cambodia on Sunday overseen by Trump.The U.S. president has repeatedly touted himself as a global peace broker. Xi told Trump on Thursday that China also played a major role in advocating for dialogue and reconciliation on various pressing matters.South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said on Thursday that he was hopeful leaders would issue a joint declaration when the summit concludes on Saturday.Huang has had a whirlwind week, with Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab becoming the first company to surpass a $5 trillion valuation but the issue of the U.S. chipmaker's sale of advanced AI chips in China was seemingly left out of Thursday's Xi-Trump summit.","headline":"Xi set to meet Canadian, Japanese leaders after Trump trade truce","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-meet-canadian-japanese-leaders-after-trump-trade-truce-2025-10-31/","message":"That agreement, struck just before Trump left South Korea, skipping the main two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, will suspend further curbs on China's exports of rare earths that threatened to jam up global supply chains. \"Changes unseen in a century are accelerating across the world,\" Xi told the assembled leaders at the closed-door opening session on Friday morning, according to China's foreign ministry. \"The rougher the seas, the more we must pull together,\" Xi added, in a speech calling for protection of the multilateral trading system and deeper economic cooperation.

Thousands of lives to remember on Russia's annual Remembrance Day for Victims of Political Repression.Nailed to the trunks of pine trees are portraits of the executed. Standing here you can feel the ghosts of Russia's past.Today, Russian authorities speak less about Stalin's crimes against his own people, preferring to portray the dictator as a victorious wartime leader.What's more, in recent years a string of repressive laws has been adopted here to punish dissent and silence criticism of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.Kremlin critics might not be denounced as \"enemies of the people\" like under Stalin. But increasingly they are being designated \"foreign agents\".More than three and a half years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities have two main objectives: victory abroad and conformity at home.Anyone here who publicly challenges, questions or even hints they doubt the official narrative that, in this war Russia is in the right, risks becoming a target.I get talking to Irina. Her daughter Diana is on her way here in a police car for a court appearance.\"I never thought anything like this could happen,\" says Irina softly. \"You can't imagine it. Until it happens to you.\"The \"mass gathering\" was an improvised street concert which the authorities claim obstructed pedestrian access to a Metro station.On the streets of St Petersburg, Stoptime have been performing songs by exiled Russian artists like Noize MC and Monetochka, singer-songwriters fiercely critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Ukraine.Many of these prominent musicians, now abroad, have been officially designated foreign agents by Russian authorities.Videos posted online show that Stoptime's street concerts have been attracting quite a crowd, with dozens of mainly young people singing along and dancing to the music.Whilst it is not forbidden in Russia to sing or play songs by foreign agents, in May a Russian court banned Noize MC's track Swan Lake Cooperative, claiming it contained \"propaganda for the violent change of the constitutional order\".But she is not free to go. The police take Diana back to the police station and prepare more charges.The next day she and her boyfriend Alexander are brought to Smolninsky District Court. I manage to have a word with them before they enter the courtroom.\"I'm very pleased, and it's important, that people have been supporting us, that many people are on our side, on the side of truth,\" Diana tells me.\"I'm surprised by how things have been exaggerated. We've been accused of lots of things we didn't do. All we were doing was bringing the music we like to a mass audience. The power of music is very important. What's happening now proves that.\"\"I think it's not the words, it's the music that is most important,\" guitarist Alexander Orlov tells me. \"Music says everything for people. It always has.\"Alexander reveals he proposed to Diana when the police van they were being transported in stopped at a petrol station.Civil society in Russia is under intense pressure. Yet supporters of Diana Loginova and Stoptime are trying to make their voices heard.\"I was on the street when Diana was singing and people were singing along so beautifully,\" says Alla outside the courthouse. \"For me it was important to be here to support Diana and show her some people do care. This should not be happening.\"To another of Diana's supporters I suggest that, in Russia now, displaying solidarity for anyone accused of discrediting the Russian army requires a degree of courage.\"It's people like Diana who are the brave ones,\" says Sasha. \"We're cowards. Some people are heroes. Others just follow behind.\"Despite the crackdown, young street musicians in St Petersburg continue to perform music by artists labelled foreign agents by Russian authorities.It's a chilly autumn evening. But passers-by have stopped to listen to a teenage band outside a St Petersburg Metro station. Among the songs they're performing are compositions by \"foreign agents\" Noize MC and Morgenshtern.She survived the Nazi siege of Leningrad (then the name for St Petersburg) and has carried with her all her life how devastating war can be.Earlier this year, on the third anniversary of Russia's \"special military operation\", Ludmila went on to the street to express her anti-war stance.\"I wrote on my placard: 'People! Let's stop the war. We bear responsibility for peace on Planet Earth!'\"Following her personal protest Ludmila received a letter from the police instructing her to report to the police station.\"They told me that I had discredited our soldiers. How? By calling for peace? I let them know that everything I'd wanted to say I'd already made quite clear on my placard and that I wouldn't be going down to the station. They threatened to take me to court. And in the end that's what they did.\"\"Why should I be scared?\" Ludmila asks me. \"Of what and of whom should I be frightened? I'm not scared of anyone. I speak the truth. And they know that.\"\"People are scared. But [the authorities] are more scared. That's why they're tightening the screws.\"Ludmila Vasilyeva's outspokenness is an exception, not the rule. Today few Russians engage in public protest. I ask Ludmila why that is: is it fear, indifference, or because of support for the authorities?\"When I go to the shops, I always strike up a conversation. No one has ever sneaked on me or put in a complaint about me.\"Once I was saying something down at the post office. Someone turned to me and said: 'Quiet, keep it down.' I replied: 'Why should I be quiet? What I'm saying, isn't it the truth? Truth must be spoken loudly.'\"It is necessary for the US to keep pace with weapons programmes in China and Russia, the president says.The experimental weapon is hailed as having a potentially unlimited range  - though Western experts have questioned its value.","headline":"How teenager gave a street concert and was caught up in Russia's repressive past","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91jyxj88ko","message":"In this part of Russia there are thousands of names to be read.

And in Pyongyang, just a few hundred miles away, it was like Trump’s trip never happened.There were no headlines. No television news reports. No mention of the US president’s offer to “work very hard with Kim Jong Un” to bring peace to the Korean peninsula. Even as Trump’s entourage rolled through Asia and speculation swirled about a possible reunion between the two leaders, North Korean state media stayed silent.American filmmaker and manager at Young Pioneer Tours Justin Martell just returned from an eight-day trip to Pyongyang, where he was attending an international film festival that happened to coincide with much of Trump’s Asia trip.He said most people he spoke with in Pyongyang didn’t even know Trump was in the region, and none were aware that Trump wanted to meet Kim again.“They weren’t negative about it,” he told CNN. “They weren’t overly hopeful either. They just kept repeating Kim Jong Un’s recent remarks — that while he has warm memories of President Trump, politics are different from feelings.”Martell said the tone wasn’t hostile, just detached. “It was more or less, ‘Here’s how we feel right now. If it happens, great. If not, it doesn’t really change much.’”Only last month Kim stood side-by-side with China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin in the heart of Beijing at a historic military parade in an unprecedented and historic show of unity against the West.Kim now has Moscow for weapons deals and oil, Beijing for trade, and a domestic narrative of resilience under sanctions and heroism on the battlefield in Ukraine.“We never were able to talk because… look I was so busy,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Thursday after departing South Korea and ending his Asia tour.North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was also away on a diplomatic mission of her own this week. She first flew to Russia for a meeting with Putin to discuss strengthening ties before speaking at an international forum in Belarus.Instead, North Korea test-fired cruise missiles to the west of the Korean peninsula ahead of Trump’s visit, during which he held a summit with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung.But as Martell’s conversations in Pyongyang suggest, timing may be only part of the story. North Korea simply may no longer feel strongly compelled to say yes.Kim has made his terms clear: he’ll meet Trump only if Washington abandons what he calls its “absurd obsession” with denuclearization. In a September speech, he said he still has “fond memories” of Trump, but that his country “will never trade away nuclear weapons to be free of sanctions.”In other words, the deal Trump offered six years ago – trading sanctions relief for disarmament – is no longer on the table. North Korea wants to be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.The North Korean elite in Pyongyang – whose support is crucial to maintaining national stability, despite Kim’s near-absolute power – appear to be enjoying a higher living standard than previously, with more access to modern technology and amenities. For the elite, at least, sanctions have done little to dent their lives.In an interview with me this week, Lee said he hopes Trump can act as a “peacemaker,” while Seoul plays “pacemaker” — creating the conditions for dialogue that remain “difficult” to achieve directly. “If the two leaders of the United States and North Korea could suddenly get together,” Lee said, “we would welcome such engagement.”“It used to feel much less developed compared to others in the region,” he said. “Now, honestly, Pyongyang feels very much like a modern city.”He described futuristic high-rises, residents paying with QR codes, new domestic apps for ordering taxis and food, and social media.“What used to take twenty minutes now takes forty,” he said, referring to the traffic. “We kept joking with our Korean guides that it was Pyonghattan” because it has developed so much.Inside the capital’s new Hwasong district, he dined at sleek restaurants offering both Asian and Western menus, with high-end liquor on display. He says all the restaurants were full of locals dining when he visited.Private car ownership was once rare and politically sensitive. Now, it’s common enough to cause occasional traffic jams in busy areas. “There seems to be a burgeoning middle class now,” Martell said.Even outside the capital, he saw evidence of growth. Traveling two hours north to Mount Myohyang, he noticed new housing under construction. “For farmers, too,” he said.Despite sanctions, he said, “the DPRK seems to be in a much different position than it was ten years ago.”Even North Korean cinema has evolved. At the Pyongyang International Film Festival, Martell watched Days and Nights of Confrontation, a new state-produced thriller dramatizing a real-life plot to assassinate Kim Jong Il.The film featured violence, modern production values, and even brief nudity — all unheard-of in North Korean films. “A character getting suffocated with a plastic bag — that’s something I’ve certainly never seen in a DPRK movie,” he said, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name.Despite the silence around Trump’s latest Asia visit, he has not been erased from Pyongyang’s official memory.Martell’s group was the first Western delegation in years to visit the International Friendship Exhibition, a sprawling mountainside museum that displays gifts and artifacts from foreign dignitaries. Taking photos inside the exhibition is strictly forbidden.“In the section devoted to Kim Jong Un, there were the expected photos — Putin, Lavrov, Xi Jinping, Dennis Rodman,” Martell said. “And President Trump was still there, displayed very prominently.”Based on my experiences traveling to the country, if the door were truly closed to future dialogue, that photo would probably have been removed.And Trump has indicated he still wants to meet Kim when he next comes to Asia. “We’ll have other visits, and we’ll work very hard with Kim Jong Un and with everybody on getting things straightened out,” he told reporters on Wednesday.","headline":"Trump has departed Asia without meeting Kim.

But it's less about the trade talks and more a bet on China's economic recovery, he said.For investors, there's ostensibly opportunity even if the two trade rivals compete fiercely while cooperating a bit.\"On both sides, they still have the mindset to strengthen the security of their own supply chains, and this brings opportunities for their domestic players in different sectors,\" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai, referring to U.S. quest to find alternate sources of rare earths and China's push for technological prowess.\"Maybe the competition will continue and at the same time, some kind of cooperation, and investors have already priced in this scenario. I think the chance for upside might be a little larger than the chance for downside.\"Analysts at BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs expect strong domestic drivers to push Chinese stocks higher.There are stubborn \"China Discounts\" to peer markets in the valuations, suggesting \"investors aren’t overpaying for the right tail from further AI optimism and liquidity overshoot in China,\" they said.\"The combination of easing Fed policy and a weaker dollar may incentivize global funds to revisit their China investment case, and to repair their persistent underweight allocations to Chinese stocks.\"\"There's a not a lot of positivity getting priced in, as investors are still sceptical as to how long this unstable equilibrium sustains,\" said Devesh Divya, FX strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore.Uncertainty had reduced but it was still a very difficult environment for corporates and multinationals looking to expand or invest, he said.","headline":"After trade truce, China becomes a bit more investible","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/after-trade-truce-china-becomes-bit-more-investible-2025-10-30/","message":"Foreign money managers have so far been both measured and selective participants in a rally that has pushed Chinese stocks to multi-year highs, fearful of pressures from deflation, weak consumption in the world's second-largest economy and trade tensions.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.The accession of new countries to the European Union risks exacerbating the shortage of critical workers in the newer member states, aggravating a brain drain.While integrating the European Union can create business and investment opportunities, it can also fuel a massive relocation of workers looking for better salaries and jobs in richer member states once freedom of movement is established. As a result, enlargement can produce negative second round effects in local economies.“While the exodus of (skilled) migrants from the Western Balkans has been ongoing for decades, EU accession could exacerbate this phenomenon as we saw in the previous enlargement,” Lien Jansen, PhD researcher at the KU Leuven university, told Euronews.Schengen visa liberalisation has made mobility easier and accelerated this long-term trend too, with many workers using the opportunity to travel to the EU for seasonal work, said Jansen. \"EU membership tends to intensify this process further by removing the remaining labour market barriers,\" she added.Still, some experts believe the impact of joining the EU may not be as drastic in the next enlargement as some the candidate countries have been stuck in the process for decades and already experienced a wave of emigration into richer member states.“It is important to highlight that there are possible economic benefits from outmigration, including trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances from migrants' host countries,” Bruegel’s research said. “Our study shows that this could also be the case”.“For the first time, the EU is offering a partial entry to these countries into the single market prior to their full entry into the EU based on conditions and reforms,” Bruegel’s affiliate fellow Nina Vujanović told Euronews.One of the constraining factors, however, is that developed European economies also benefit in the short term from this emigration of skilled workers from the Western Balkans, particularly in sectors facing labour shortages such as healthcare, Jansen added.“Growth benefits from the EU entry outweigh the population losses,” Vujanović said. She added that all central and eastern European countries that have joined the bloc have experienced stronger economic convergence despite the brain drain effect.Vujanović also explained that entry into the EU single market opens growth potential for such small economies because it allows better integration into EU supply chains.Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Moldova are part of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA), a condition included in the Growth Plan, meaning that cross-border payments between the EU and their countries are much faster and cheaper.On November 4, the European Commission is expected to present its annual evaluation of the candidate countries to assess their progress and give recommendations in areas such as rule of law, fundamental rights and justice.Bernstein said that supporting measures to help retain and attract talent, such as linking funding to local employment or promoting circular migration, would also be needed.“Candidate countries could focus on reducing the push factors that drive skilled workers away, for example, by improving the path from education to work, strengthening key sectors, and offering better working conditions,” she added.Some countries, aware of the issue, have already started implementing reforms to incentivise the return of their citizens. In Serbia, for example, employers who hire returnees from the diaspora to work in innovation and qualified sectors receive a tax break.","headline":"Is risk of ‘brain drain’ overlooked in the EU’s enlargement process","level":"euronews","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/10/31/is-the-risk-of-brain-drain-overlooked-in-the-eus-enlargement-process","message":"The Cube is a team of specialist social media journalists who find, verify and debunk the biggest stories in real-time.

Donald Trump's five-day swing through eastern Asia, on the other hand, has been a display of the power of Trump - but also, at times, of that power's limitations.Trump's stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea over the course of the first four days were an exercise in pleasing a sometimes mercurial American president. It was an acknowledgement that Trump, with the flick of a pen, could impose tariffs and other measures that have the potential to devastate the economies of export-dependent nations.It was a meeting of equals on the global stage, where the stakes for both nations – for their economies, for their international prestige, for the welfare of their people - were enormous.With China, Trump may flick his pen, but such actions come with consequences. They come with a cost.Each stop was punctuated by a blend of traditional trade negotiations – deals made under the shadow of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs – and personal accommodations that at times bordered on the obsequious.In Malaysia, Trump secured access to critical minerals and made progress toward finalising trade arrangements with south-east Asian nations. He also presided over a treaty that should ease border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia – the kind of \"peace deal\" the American president loves to tout.In Japan, Trump's Marine One flew past a Tokyo Tower lit red, white and blue – with a top in Trumpian gold.President Lee Jae Myung held an \"honour ceremony\" for Trump during which he gave the American leader his nation's highest medal and a replica of an ancient Korean dynastic crown.Lunch with Lee featured a \"Peacemaker's Dessert\" of gold-encrusted brownies. Later that day, the Koreans served Trump vineyard wine at an intimate dinner in Trump's honour with six world leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit.In the US, Trump may be the subject of \"No Kings\" demonstrations by Americans who disapprove of his boundary-testing expansions of presidential power, but during his East Asia swing he was treated like royalty.There, the power dynamic between leaders of the world's two largest economies was decidedly different than the interactions Trump had with his foreign counterparts in previous days.Missing were all the pomp and the pageantry. No military bands, no honour guards, no carefully crafted menus celebrating mutual national affection. Instead, the two leaders and their top aides sat across a long white negotiating table in a nondescript military building just off the runway of Busan's international airport.It was perhaps a reflection of the high stakes that when Trump shook hands with Xi in Busan, he appeared tense. It was a far cry from his relaxed attitude when he told me the day before that he was optimistic he would have a good meeting.\"I know a little bit about what's going on because we have been talking to them,\" he said. \"I'm not just walking into a meeting cold.\"For months, Trump had been threatening higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the US – as a source of revenue for the American treasury as well as to pressure China to open its markets and control the export of chemicals used to make the drug fentanyl.If tariffs were a source of economic hardship for China, then Beijing would target America's vulnerabilities. It suspended purchase of US agricultural products and proposed export controls on its large supply of critical minerals - resources that the US, and much of the world, rely on for high-tech manufacturing.But it was a battle of wills and economic pain set the two nations on a path that ultimately led to Thursday's meeting and an agreement on both sides to de-escalate.The US lowered its tariffs, while China eased access to critical minerals, and pledged to resume importing US agricultural products and increase purchases of US oil and gas.While it may not have been a breakthrough, it was an acknowledgement by both sides that the existing situation was unsustainable.The international order that will take its place, however, is far from clear. As Xi acknowledged in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting, China and the US \"do not always see eye to eye with each other\".That may represent an improved outlook after months of tension, but it was also an sign that \"frictions\" are here to stay.Trump, for his part, has attempted to reorder American priorities abroad, using US economic might to pressure allies and adversaries alike. And it is those American allies – nations like Japan and South Korea that have long relied on American political, economic and military support -  that are scrambling to adjust to the new reality.Some of that scrambling comes in the form of  a bend-backward willingness to accommodate Trump in forms large and small. Gifts and dinnertime honours are easy, but multibillion dollar payments, increased military spending and permanent tariffs take a toll.And they could ultimately prompt a reevaluation of relations with America – and, as a result, with China.Trump may have received a king's welcome in South Korea, but, in what could be viewed as a bit of on-point symbolism, as he departed, it was Xi who was arriving. And the Chinese leader's Korean hosts had promised a diplomatic reception equal to that received by the Americans.Xi is fully participating in the Apec leaders meetings – proceedings that Trump chose to skip. If there is a vacuum created by America's international manoeuvres, it is a void China appears more than willing to fill.Trump may be returning to America with everything he wanted from this trip. But, in a twist on the Rolling Stones song that he used to play at his political rallies, it's not yet clear that he got what America needs.Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.Thousands of US adoptees do not have citizenship despite being brought to the country as babies decades ago. Now many fear deportation.","headline":"Trump's Asia tour sees deals, knee-bending and a revealing final meeting","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j8zn0ex9ro","message":"US presidential trips abroad have traditionally been an opportunity to display the power of the American nation on the world stage.

Earlier this month he was forced to stop using his title of Duke of York.Charles has now escalated his actions against Andrew by stripping him of all his titles, leaving him to be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.The Buckingham Palace statement said a formal notice had now been served on Andrew to surrender the lease of his Royal Lodge mansion on the Windsor Estate, west of London, and he will move to alternative private accommodation on the Sandringham estate in eastern England.The decision by the king, who is still undergoing regular treatment for cancer, marks one of the most dramatic moves against a member of the royal family in modern British history.\"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,\" the palace said. \"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"That year, he settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who died in April, which accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. Andrew has always denied her account, which has recently returned to prominence with the release of her memoir.A statement released by Giuffre's family members and carried by several media organisations said her family would \"continue Virginia’s battle\" and that all abusers and abettors connected to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell needed to be held to account.A palace source said that while Andrew continued to deny the accusations against him, it was clear that there had been serious lapses of judgement. The source said the decision was taken by Charles but that the monarch had the support of the wider family, including heir-to-the-throne Prince William.In a rare political intervention into the workings of the royal family, a British parliamentary committee had on Wednesday questioned whether Andrew should still be living in the house.","headline":"King Charles strips brother Andrew of titles and his mansion","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/king-charles-strips-brother-andrew-titles-his-home-2025-10-30/","message":"Andrew, 65, the younger brother of Charles and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has come under mounting pressure in recent years over his behaviour and his ties to the late sex offender Epstein.

Many say their lives remain in a limbo - effectively homeless and without a steady source of income.Anxieties grew further in July when the state's then Chief Secretary Prashant Singh announced that all relief camps would be shut down by December and its residents would be resettled.He added that those unable to return to their homes would be relocated to pre-fabricated housing units.The government, however, did not clarify where these units would be - whether near the relief camps or near displaced people's original homes  - worsening their concerns about future.On the ground, Manipur remains sharply divided: the Meiteis inhabit the Imphal Valley, while the Kukis live in the surrounding hill districts; and security forces continue to patrol the buffer zones that separate the two communities.A security official deployed in the area told BBC Hindi that his mandate was to \"ensure that Meiteis and Kukis remain in their respective areas and do not mix\".Experts say resettling people in their original neighbourhoods is crucial to prevent the violence from redrawing Manipur's social map.\"This is not good for a secular, democratic India. Resettling them in their original homes is most critical,\" said RK Nimai Singh, former secretary to the Manipur governor.He added that many displaced people feared that if they left the relief camps and moved into temporary housing, they might never be able to return to their homes.It's a thought that haunts Hatnu Haokip. For her, home means only one place - Imphal valley - and she yearns to go back.Ms Haokip added that she would feel safer if Kuki leaders were given autonomy to set up a separate federally-administered territory for the community.This sentiment was echoed by several other Kukis, who also feel apprehensive of returning to their homes.Irom Abung, who once ran a water supply business in Churachandpur, now lives in a relief camp near a buffer zone.His house was damaged during the violence, but Mr Abung says he will never give up on the place he once called home.\"My land remains. I will never sell it because I know I will return one day,\" he said. \"Efforts must be made to bridge the gap between our two communities so people can go back to their lives.\"The unease, coupled with uncertainty over where the new homes will be built, has raised doubts over whether the government would be able to close all relief camps by December.\"Eventually, we want to resettle people in the areas from where they fled, once they feel safe to return.\"The official added that while they understood people's concerns, it was also in the state's interest for them to return home - otherwise, the divisions would only grow deeper.As tens of thousands of people continue to live in relief camps, many complain about not getting the facilities the government promised them.After government doctors failed to help, she borrowed money to take him to a private hospital, but was unable to afford the treatment.Ms Lhungdim says the government sometimes organises health camps, but they have never treated her son. BBC Hindi has reached out to officials for a response.Inside the camps, residents say prolonged displacement and uncertainty are also taking a toll on people's mental health.Meanwhile, those moved from camps into temporary housing say that while they now have a roof over their heads, they still struggle to make ends meet as livelihood remains a concern.Chingakham Radha, one of the newly resettled residents, said she learned to make crochet dolls while living in the camp and now earns a small income from selling them. \"The money is very little, just enough to get by,\" she said.Before the conflict, Ms Radha was a homemaker and her husband worked as a labourer. They were not wealthy, but had a happy life.\"Some days my husband finds work, but other times weeks go by without any work,\" she said. \"I want to return home to Churachandpur, but those hopes are fading with time.\"Video released by India’s Southern Railways shows the moment a woman nearly fell in between a moving train and a station platform.","headline":"'Can't go back' - families in violence-hit Indian state fear resettlement deadline","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c364j8r7xjgo","message":"Thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes in India's north-eastern state of Manipur two years ago now face an uncertain future, as the government plans to shut down all temporary relief camps by December.

But Thursday's agreement is still a breakthrough.It steadies what has become a rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies and it assures global markets.But it is only a temporary truce. It doesn't solve the differences at the heart of such a competitive relationship.\"The US and China are going in different directions,\" says Kelly Ann Shaw, who was an economic adviser to Trump in his first term.\"It's really about managing the breakup in a way that does a limited amount of damage, that preserves US interests, and I think from China's perspective, preserves their own interests. But this is not a relationship that is necessarily going to improve dramatically anytime soon.\"It involves flattery - and most countries have tried it, including on his trip to Asia so far. South Korea gave him an enormous golden crown, while Japan's prime minister  nominated him for a Nobel Peace prize.But the Chinese leader offered only a meeting at a South Korean air base, where he and Trump would cross paths - as one flew in to the country, and the other departed.It didn't feel out of step with China's guarded but defiant response from the start of Trump's trade war. Just days after the American president increased tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing retaliated with its own levies.Chinese officials told the world that there would be no winners in a trade war. Like Trump, Xi too believed he had the upper hand - and he seemed to have a plan.He decided to use the country's economic weight - as the world's factory, as a massive market for its goods - to push back.That doesn't mean that Xi faces no pressures - he certainly does. He needs China's economy to grow, and create jobs and wealth so the Chinese Communist Party's power is not challenged by instability or discontent.And yet, despite the country's current challenges - a real estate crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer spending - China has shown it is willing to absorb the pain of Trump's tariffs.\"China's main principle is struggle, but don't break,\" says Keyu Jin, author of The New China Playbook.\"The nuance often missed in the rare earths debate is that China has an overwhelming position over the most strategic bit of the rare earth supply chain -  the heavy rare earths used in advanced defence systems,\" says Jason Bedford, macroeconomics expert and investment analyst.So getting China to relax those export controls became a priority for Washington - and that was a key bit of leverage for Xi when he sat down with Trump.China had also stopped buying US soybeans, which was aimed at farmers in Republican states - Trump's base.\"If the US thinks that it can dominate China, it can suppress China, I think has proven to be wrong,\" Ms Jin says.\"This is really signalling to the world, especially the United States, that China needs to be respected, that it will not kowtow or give too many political or economic concessions.\"Trump's team has found itself dealing with a stronger China compared to his first term. Beijing has learnt lessons, too.Xi showed up in South Korea - after officially confirming the meeting with Trump just the day before - to take part in political theatre that seemed to underline a position of strength.As usual, he was in front of Trump for the handshake. He stood unblinking as Trump leaned forward to whisper in his ear - the kind of ad lib moment China abhors.At the end of the meeting, Trump ushered Xi to his waiting car where the Chinese leader was immediately surrounded by his security team. The US president was then forced to wander off camera to find his vehicle alone.And yet, there are many positives to take away from this superpower summit - the first of  Trump's second term in office.\"China wants to be in a position of strength when it comes to negotiations, but it won't break the relationship, because that is in nobody's interest, including China's,\" Ms Jin says.For starters, businesses, the markets and other countries caught in between the rivals will welcome the calm. But observers are not sure it will last.\"I think over the medium to long-term, the US and China have very serious differences, and I would not be surprised to see some more destabilisation in the next three to six months,\" says Ms Shaw.Even if he does get a deal, and the two sides put ink on paper, Beijing has now shown that it is not willing to bend to Washington - and that it is more resilient.Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.Thousands of US adoptees do not have citizenship despite being brought to the country as babies decades ago.

Here is a playbook for consumers in the current interest-rate environment.Doug Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, a New York-based financial advisory firm and author of the new book, “Money Together, opens new tab,” is not concerned.“If you invest in bonds believing rates will come down more drastically than they have been, you’re not going to receive the appreciation you want,” Boneparth said.That is not bad for long-term investors: because bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, it also means that fixed-income “is still a decent income driver,\" he added.The rate on higher-yielding savings accounts in the U.S. is hovering around 4%, which is outpacing the inflation rate by about one percentage point, so you are not losing money by putting your cash in a high-yield account.If you already hold a fixed‑rate certificate of deposit, nothing changes.

A handful of keys were handed in as people filed out at the end, the attendees told Reuters.\"Sharaa lacks any institutional framework or textbooks to rely on,\" said Hossam Jazmati, a Syrian researcher on Islamist groups who has studied the former warrior-sheikh for more than a decade.Now, loyalists taking spoils of war would threaten his ability to consolidate power, Jazmati said: \"He requires substantial financial resources to sustain his administration — not necessarily for personal gain, but to maintain authority.\"Syria's Ministry of Information told Reuters that Sharaa had arranged a \"friendly, informal meeting\" in Idlib with former commanders, officials and other notables which touched on political and security challenges as well as the need to change the \"investment culture established by the former regime\".\"He stressed that he would not tolerate any suspicion of corruption among state employees,\" the ministry said.Two older brothers hold top jobs in the new government. Hazem oversees foreign and local business and investment in Syria, including the work of former rebel fighters tasked with overhauling Syria's economy. Maher, a gynaecologist with Syrian-Russian dual nationality, is secretary-general of the presidency, chairing official meetings and attending talks with foreign dignitaries, including Sharaa's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month.Multiple Syrian officials said Sharaa's reliance on relatives and others close to him was a result of needing to quickly fill gaps in his new administration following the unexpected collapse of Assad's government. Critics see it as a worrying emulation of family rule under the old regime.But another elder brother - Jamal, a businessman - has fallen foul of Sharaa's fledgling anti-corruption drive, according to six people familiar with the matter including government officials and business figures.Following Sharaa's rise to power, Jamal set up an office in the capital Damascus from where he ran various ventures including import-export and tourism businesses, they said.He became a common sight in upmarket hotel lobbies and restaurants, to which he was driven in a black Mercedes S-class saloon with tinted windows and no license plates.Sharaa ordered the office be shut in August and instructed government entities not to deal with his brother, the sources told Reuters. The decision concerned allegations that Jamal had used his family link to the president to set up dozens of meetings with government and business figures to advance his personal interests, they said.A Reuters reporter found the office shut and locked this month, with red wax blotched on the doors. No one answered the doorbell.Red wax is often used in the region, including in Syria, to seal properties ordered shut pending corruption investigations.Syria's information ministry confirmed the office had been closed down. \"Jamal al-Sharaa was not permitted to work as an investment or commercial entity,\" it told Reuters. \"The presidency has clarified since the formation of the government that Jamal al-Sharaa did not hold any official position.\"The ministry didn't say whether, or what, specific charges authorities had been levelled against the president's brother.Reuters was unable to contact Jamal for comment. Reached by phone, the head of Jamal's office said the pair were outside Damascus and didn't comment further.Shortly after closing Jamal's office, Sharaa held a meeting with family members, including his 79-year-old father, warning them against exploiting the family name for personal gain, according to a relative who attended the meeting.The warning that Sharaa delivered to loyalists in August followed complaints voiced by ordinary Syrians at a meeting with the president earlier that month over the newfound luxury of some former rebels now in the civil service, according to an attendee.Corruption nonetheless persists in post-Assad Syria, including the payment of bribes to get out of jail or recover houses, vehicles and other valuables seized by members of the new ruling order, according to interviews with nine Syrian business figures and former and current officials.One industrialist and two senior factory managers, who all requested anonymity to speak freely, said they had been forced to pay cash to well-connected intermediaries, with no receipt or formal documentation, to keep their businesses running or secure the release of employees detained over alleged past ties to the Assad regime.The information ministry said such practices were not widespread and that some people suspected of taking bribes in exchange for releasing detainees or doing other official business had been referred for \"immediate investigation\".A major area of concern within Syria's business community, according to the people interviewed, is the opaque process of settlement deals struck by government officials with people accused of links to Assad. The deals, in which business owners hand over assets in exchange for being allowed to return to work in Syria, began to take shape immediately after Damascus fell.Authorities are trying to route all such settlements via a committee on illicit gains formed in May, before turning the assets over to a new sovereign wealth fund that is still being set up, according to six people including government officials and businessmen familiar with the matter.The fund now holds hundreds of companies, office buildings, factories and other assets linked to people accused of connections to the Assad regime, the six people said.Two lawyers working for the fund have been arrested pending investigations over alleged graft, with one detained for more than a month, the people told Reuters.The information ministry confirmed the arrests, saying the lawyers were being investigated over \"alleged theft that has not yet been proven\". Some members of the illicit gains committee, which is tasked with investigating corruption, have also been detained for investigations about suspected wrongdoing though not formally arrested, the ministry said.","headline":"No spoils of war: Syria's new ruler lays down the law to loyalists","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/no-spoils-war-syrias-new-ruler-lays-down-law-loyalists-2025-10-31/","message":"\"Have you forgotten you are the sons of the revolution?\" Sharaa rebuked the gathered officials and business leaders, according to two people present, remarking upon the large number of Cadillac Escalades, Range Rovers and Chevrolet Tahoes parked outside.  \"Have you been tempted so quickly?\"Sharaa ordered civil servants with luxury cars to hand over the keys or face being investigated for illicit gains, according to the two attendees as well as two civil servants briefed on the address, who all requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.

Beijing even tightened earlier this month its controls by massively expanding its restrictions..Under Thursday’s deal, China agreed to roll back those newly imposed rules, though the initial restrictions unveiled in April appear to remain in place.The tussle over rare earths precedes the current administration; China for years has built up near-total control of the minerals as part of its wider industrial policy.The name “rare earths” is a bit of a misnomer, as the materials are found throughout the Earth’s crust. They are more abundant than gold, but they are difficult and costly to extract and process and are also environmentally damaging.Rare earths are ubiquitous in everyday technologies, from smartphones to wind turbines to LED lights and flat-screen TVs. They’re crucial for batteries in electric vehicles, as well as MRI scanners and cancer treatments.There are two types of rare earths, categorized by their atomic weights: heavy and light. Heavy rare earths are more scarce, and the United States doesn’t have the capability to separate rare earths after extraction.“Until the start of the year, whatever heavy rare earths we did mine in California, we still sent to China for separation,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN.However, the Trump administration’s announcement of sky-high tariffs on China in April derailed this process. “China has shown a willingness to weaponize” America’s reliance on China for rare earth separation, she said.Beijing is using rare earths as major leverage in the trade war, and its latest restrictions were a major topic of conversation when Xi and Trump met Thursday at the APEC summit in South Korea.It’s not the first time this year that Chinese restrictions on rare earths have angered Trump. In June, Trump said on Truth Social that China violated a trade truce as Beijing kept its export controls on seven rare earth minerals and associated products.But China’s latest restrictions were seen as a dramatic escalation in Trump’s trade war between the world’s two biggest economic powers.CNN’s Nectar Gan, John Liu, Donald Judd, Kylie Atwood, Phil Mattingly and David Goldman contributed to this report.","headline":"What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump’s trade deal with China?","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/business/rare-earth-minerals-deal","message":"The US trade deal with China seeks to resolve a major sticking point of their ongoing trade war: rare-earth minerals.

The revelations would lead him on a decade-long trail, revealing a family devastated by the Holocaust, a vanished fortune worth billions of pounds and a legacy of artwork and property stolen under Nazi rule.Black-and-white photographs gave a glimpse of Peter's early life, far removed from his son's modest upbringing in London - they showed a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, mansions staffed by servants, staircases ornately carved with angels.He says his father was a quiet and serious man, if prone to bouts of anger. He avoided talking about his childhood and always shut down questions about his slight German accent.\"There were clues that [he wasn't] really like other people… There was a darkness around his world,\" says Antony.Enlisting the help of a friend who spoke fluent German, he asked her to dig into a company called Hahn'sche Werke, references to which were peppered among the documents in the suitcase. After searching online, she sent Antony a photo of a painting, depicting the inside of a large steelworks - seemingly owned by the businessMolten metal glows hot on a conveyor belt, illuminating the faces of busy and attentive workers. It is an image of industrial power and might, from an era when Germany was hurtling towards decades of devastating war.Heinrich, and his wife, Olga, owned several properties in and around Berlin, including an impressive six-storey property in the city centre with marble floors and a cream-white facade.The war had been a human catastrophe, but Hahn'sche Werke had prospered in that period, satisfying the German military's demand for steel. Rudolf and his family also successfully weathered the economic and political chaos which haunted their country after the fighting.Rudolf Eisner believed he would be safe if he made his company invaluable to the Nazi regime. For a time, this seemed to work, but as anti-Jewish laws became more and more extreme, and the abuse they witnessed around them worsened, he began to reconsider.\"It is almost impossible to quantify the wealth stolen and how much those assets are worth today,\" says David de Jong, author of the book Nazi Billionaires, which retraces the looting of Jewish businesses under the Third Reich.At the height of this crisis, a man named Martin Hartig, an economist and tax adviser according to records in Berlin's archives, began to loom large in the Eisners' lives.Herr Hartig, who wasn't Jewish, appears to have offered the family a solution to the impending confiscation of their assets by the Nazis. They signed over key elements of their personal fortune to him - chiefly the multiple properties they owned and their contents - thereby sheltering them from laws targeting Jews.The BBC found copies of the original sales documents in Germany's federal archives and shared them with three independent experts. All three concluded that this deal was evidence of a \"forced sale\" - a term widely used to describe the dispossession of Jewish assets under the Nazis.The next step for Antony was to find out what had happened to the Eisner family fortune, and to Martin Hartig.He hired an experienced investigator, Yana Slavova, to find out what exactly had been stolen, how it had changed hands, and where it was today.Within weeks, Yana had uncovered troves of documents about his relatives, including details of their properties and possessions.She was able to trace the painting Antony had discovered at the beginning of his journey. Eisenwalzwerk was in the collection of the Brohan Museum in Berlin.Early attempts to reclaim the artwork ran into problems regarding the evidence. Could Antony prove that its sale was tied to Nazi persecution? How did he know it hadn't changed hands multiple times legitimately before ending up in the museum?A breakthrough came when Yana unearthed correspondence between the museum and an art dealer at the time of the sale.She told them her father had always been opposed to the Nazis and had helped save the Eisners, who she described as great friends, from the Holocaust. She said he helped convince them to get away, urging the family: \"You can't stay here. Go to Great Britain, to London.\"Her father had also told her he helped them smuggle paintings out of Germany by taking them out of their frames and hiding them among clothes.Other members of the family were more open to the possibility that their ancestor may have exploited the Eisners.He admitted to feeling that his home, where Antony's grandparents once lived, may have had an uncomfortable past.\"I mean of course I was curious at some point - where does it come from that we as a family live in this nice place,\" he said. \"I've also asked myself the question, how were the circumstances?\"After discovering what happened to Antony's Jewish family, Vincent said he thought the Eisners had little choice when they passed their property to his great-grandfather.For the artworks taken from the Eisner family, however, there is still hope for recovering what was lost.Earlier this year, the Brohan Museum in Berlin informed Antony that it intended to return the Eisenwalzwerk painting to the descendants of Henrich Eisner. The museum declined an interview with the BBC while the process remains ongoing.Another painting has been returned to Antony from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and a third claim for an artwork in Austria also remains outstanding.Among the evidence Antony's investigation has unearthed is a list made by the Gestapo, detailing specific artefacts and paintings which were seized from his relatives. There is a chance his family could find and reclaim more assets in the future.\"I've always said about restitution, it's not about objects and money and property, it's about people,\" says Antony. In researching his family's past, he has recovered detailed knowledge of who his father and his grandparents once were.\"You know, as long as Caspian's around, that name will still be around with him,\" he says. \"People will say, 'that's an interesting middle name - what's the story there?'\"Archaeologists believe the musket balls are from a part of the battle that allowed Jacobites to escape.From candlelit mansions to ghostly art tours, the Big Apple is teeming with places that reveal its haunted history.Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica with the strongest windspeeds the Caribbean nation has ever experienced.

Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it.\"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,\" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects.Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. \"If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy,\" he adds.Around the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging.But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects.A key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid – it's hard to get access to a big connection for powering your trains. \"That problem has only become much, much worse,\" says Mr Murray.Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way.Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain, is seeking suppliers for rail-side renewables projects.\"This is the big one,\" says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract.New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system.But for trains that are switching off diesel and over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC).Efforts are underway in England to develop a new converter device that could solve this problem, though.\"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,\" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. \"All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.\"But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system. It's retrofitted onto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets.\"We eliminate locomotives completely,\" says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. \"Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups.\"A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area.Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year.It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators.Stuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be \"quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways\".But he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the \"go-to\" option for new railways.\"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case,\" he says.The site tells BBC News it believes people are viewing riskier sites - but they may just be using VPNs.Harvesting solar energy in orbit and beaming it down to Earth is a decades-old idea.

In July, Israel’s ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism (UTJ), announced it was quitting the country’s fractious right-wing coalition, leaving Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority in the Knesset.Parliament has been struggling to draft a new conscription bill, which has so far failed to meet both the ultra-Orthodox demands and those of a stretched military.","headline":"Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews rally in Jerusalem against military service","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/thousands-of-ultra-orthodox-rally-in-jerusalem-against-military-service","message":"Tens of thousands of protesters have marched in Jerusalem to demand that ultra-Orthodox Jewish people remain exempt from Israeli military service.

The question now: whether King Charles and the British establishment have done enough to prevent Andrew’s association with Epstein from engulfing the monarchy.Giuffre’s family said in a statement on Thursday: “Today, an ordinary American girl, from an ordinary American family, brought down a British prince with her truth and extraordinary courage.”Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that it had been a “joyous and happy and sad day.”In the statement,  Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew would be forced out his residence and take the family name.  “Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation,” the statement continued.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.”It’s understood the palace acted because while it acknowledges that Andrew continues to deny all allegations made against him, it had concluded that he made serious lapses of judgement.CNN understands that rather than formally remove Andrew’s title as Duke of York via an act of parliament, King Charles will send royal warrants to remove Andrew’s peerages.Andrew was also known as the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The stripping of his titles takes immediate effect.“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” Buckingham Palace added in the statement.In his interview with CNN, Sky Roberts said King Charles’ decision vindicated the years of campaigning by his sister. “She should be here. She should be having this interview with you,” he said.“She had been fighting for this for a long time. She always said… only one of us is telling the truth and I know that’s me,” Roberts said. “We’re really proud of her. We’re so proud of what she was able to achieve.”Calling it a “huge moment” for his sister and other survivors, Roberts said: “It’s an acknowledgement to say, we believe you. We see you. And for me, I love you. We love you… This is a very vindicating moment for us. And I just wish she was here to to share this with us.”Giuffre’s family said in their statement they would fight to ensure other associates of Epstein would face similar judgement. “Our sister, a child when she was sexually assaulted by Andrew, never stopped fighting for accountability for what had happened to her and to countless other survivors like her. Today, she declares victory,” the statement said, adding they will “not rest until the same accountability applies to all of the abusers and abettors connected to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”The anti-monarchy group Republic said Thursday that it had instructed lawyers to launch a private prosecution against Andrew “over accusations of sexual offenses and misconduct in public office.”The group said its lawyers would be actively investigating the case against Andrew and aim to begin proceedings in the coming weeks. Republic has previously called for the police to investigate Andrew.“Let’s be very clear, Prince Andrew – now Andrew Mountbatton Windsor – is not facing justice. He’s not being held to account. Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said Thursday following the palace’s announcement.“This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”On Monday, the British monarch was heckled by a protester who could be heard shouting “How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?” as he carried out a cathedral visit in northwest England.CNN also understands that the British government was consulted on the King’s decisions, and the government has made it clear that it supports the moves.CNN’s MiSeon Lee contributed to this report.

The day is packed with lively parades and rituals such as the decoration of altars, and sumptuous victuals including Mexican street food, a special kind of bread and hot chocolate.The Day of the Dead, or El Dia de los Muertos, is not for mourning or grieving, but for celebrating the lives of those who have passed.It is believed to be a time when the living and dead can connect with each other. Traditional practices, such as placing marigold flowers on altars and offering certain food items, the aroma and colour of which are thought to help spirits return to visit the living.The festival is rooted in the ancient Aztec belief that death is a continuation of life. Descendants of the Aztec people exist to this day, primarily in Mexico.They also honoured the goddess of the underworld, Mictecacihuatl, and made offerings of food from the harvest and personal belongings to her during these festivals.Families create altars called “ofrendas” in their homes and in cemeteries, laden with offerings to deceased loved ones and ancestors.Altars are created with two levels to symbolise heaven and Earth, three levels to include purgatory, or seven levels to signify the steps to reach heaven.Items representing the four elements are also placed on the altars: water to quench visitors’ thirst; fire in candles to guide the spirits; earth, represented by food and special items for the deceased; and air, represented by colourful paper designs. Some altars also include salt, which is believed to aid souls on their journey in the afterlife.These altars also display pictures of the deceased, items of their favourite food, candles and marigold flowers, which are believed to help lead spirits back from the cemetery to their family’s homes.The altars also include tongue-in-cheek poems dedicated to the deceased loved ones called “calaveras” (skulls). These poems describe interesting habits and funny stories which took place during the lives of the now deceased.Skulls, which represent the cyclical nature of life and death, are a pervasive symbol during the Day of the Dead. Sugar skulls, or “calavera de azucar” are edible and decorative skull models made with sugar, clay or papier-mache, are used to adorn altars.Another common food item during the festival is the “bread of the dead” – “pan de muerto” – a circular loaf of bread with bone-shaped designs. The bread is typically sugar-coated, representing the tears of sorrow shed by loved ones.Websites such as MiAltar also allow users to create virtual altars. These can be shared on the website.La Catrina dons a fancy French hat and feathers.

Last year, labour unions at major automakers set pay hike targets in December.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has recently chimed in, urging the government of new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who is known as an advocate of loose monetary policy, to allow the BOJ to raise rates and avoid excessive yen declines.\"A hawkish bloc has solidified within the BOJ policy board\" with the hawks having \"an external advocate pushing for monetary tightening\" in Bessent, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, who predicts a rate hike in December.\"As a new prime minister, it may even be advantageous for Takaichi to get the rate hike out of the way early on in her tenure,\" he added.By then, there will be more clarity on the Takaichi administration's budget plans and economic policies. The BOJ, too, can offer a more thorough analysis justifying a rate hike in a quarterly report due after the January meeting.In the end, however, the timing may depend much on yen moves as a renewed slide in the currency would push up import costs and broader inflation, some analysts say.Further rises in the cost of living would run counter to Takaichi's pledge to cushion households' blow from inflation.Former BOJ executive Akira Otani expects the BOJ to hike rates in January, when enough data becomes available on whether companies will weather the tariff hit and keep hiking pay. But he cites the yen as potentially changing the timing.\"At present, we don't see a strong chance of a December rate increase,\" said Otani, currently managing director at Goldman Sachs Japan. \"But the possibility could heighten if yen falls accelerate and increase the risk of inflation overshooting the BOJ's baseline forecast made in October.\"","headline":"BOJ locks in near-term rate hike, yen may sway timing","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/boj-locks-near-term-rate-hike-yen-may-sway-timing-2025-10-31/","message":"While warning of lingering global uncertainties, the board revised up this year's growth forecast and made few tweaks to its sanguine view of Japan's recovery prospects in a quarterly report released after the meeting.

She said she's already all in for Mamdani.\"Regardless of what the polls say, we need to make sure our friends and families get out and vote,\" Wood urged, noting a resounding mandate would help to energise Mamdani's ambitious plans: rent freezes on stabilised apartments, free buses, and universal childcare, paid for by increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthiest New Yorkers.At a nearby, pre-war rent-stabilised apartment building, another man said he was unsure. Wood pointed to Mamdani's vow to freeze rents in buildings like his, which make up about a quarter of the city's housing stock.Down the street, climbing a steep concrete stoop, Wood met Onika Saul, a 45-year-old property manager. In Mamdani's pledges, she worried, \"realism is kind of skewed\".\"So I think for me personally, being disappointed so many times by so many politicians and so many promises, I want to see more action than words.\"But Wood dug in. He detailed Mamdani's activism as a state assemblyman, which included joining a taxi worker hunger strike; he had been arrested in front of US Senator Chuck Schumer's home during a protest against US funding for the war in Gaza; Mamdani, he noted, has relied on small donations, unlike the sums provided by billionaire business and real estate leaders who have fuelled Cuomo's campaign.He also pointed to an issue that has been one of the most decisive in the race: Mamdani, he noted, has been a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, a rarity in mainstream US politics.\"Zohran is certainly the only politician in the race who will call what's happening [in Gaza], what it is: a genocide,\" Wood said.By the end, Saul still had her reservations. After all, Mamdani's top pledges —rent freezes and universal childcare for children under five — would not directly apply to her. But she said she's willing to give his vision a shot—and her vote.Mamdani has been trying to bridge that chasm in belief in the final stretch of the election contest. Polls have tightened, with opponent Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York State, making explicit appeals to conservatives and independents to back him or face the degradation of the city as they know it.\"We wanted to rebuild a coalition that had frayed over years of disappointment and neglect, to win people back to a Democratic Party that puts working people first,\" Mamdani said after the win, in one of the ubiquitous direct-to-camera social media videos he has used to appeal to a chronically online generation of voters.\"The headline is clear: we can win back voters many have written off if we give them something to vote for, not just tell them what to be against,\" he said.\"Please, please, do not underestimate our opponents,\" Sanders said at a rally kicking off the final sprint of the race.It is a question that has hung in the air since June: Why is Mamdani the man for this political moment?At a bohemian beer garden in Astoria, Queens, where the New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) held a watch party during the first of two general election debates, Susan Kang attempted to unpack the query.That exposed \"the weaknesses of a conventional Democratic message\", particularly on economic issues and affordability, explained Kang, an associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan who is also affiliated with the DSA.Cuomo, to many young voters who buoyed Mamdani's success, is emblematic of the same tired Democratic Party of old.Then there is the continued knock-on of the so-called \"Bernie Sanders effect\", which helped bring Democratic Socialist policies to the fore. While Democratic Socialism is a distinct, if amorphous, ideology, the term \"socialist\" has for decades been a political slur in the post-Cold War US.While Cuomo's approach says, \"I'm gonna whip this city into shape\", Kang said, Mamdani shows a warmth and familiarity with the tapestry of personalities that make up the wildly diverse metropolis. One of his most popular videos highlighted common issues facing halal workers. Others have featured deli workers, subway commuters and cab drivers.\"I think Zohran has really shown that he loves New York City,\" Kang said.  \"He wants to make this a city that works for everybody.\"In a second-floor office in South Richmond Hill, Queens, Sherry Padilla believes Mamdani is uniquely positioned to rally immigrant working-class communities who feel left behind by establishment politics.Mamdani's ground game in the run-up to the primary relied heavily not just on the DSA's sprawling volunteer infrastructure, but also on community groups like DRUM Beats, a political committee affiliated with the Queens-headquartered Desis Rising Up and Resisting.He has been leveraging that same support as the general election approaches, continuing to tour mosques, Hindu and Jewish temples, and Christian churches across the five boroughs.Hosting a phone-banking event for DRUM Beats, Padilla said she is hoping to convince voters to see in Mamdani what she sees. Her outreach specifically targets the South Richmond Hill area, home to a large Guyanese and South Asian population.\"We've had politicians who come into our community, say two or three words in our language and eat one of our favourite foods, and then it's like, 'OK, see you next election season,'\" Padilla said.\"Zohran's constantly been in our communities and has been by our working class, our Black or brown residents and supported our struggles and fought with us,\" she said. \"That's something that we've never seen before in a politician.\"At a pro-Mamdani rally in Midtown, Manhattan, Salim Drammeh, who leads Africans for Zohran, said the overlap of Mamdani's identity and the policies he spearheads has the potential to invigorate dormant voting blocks.\"In my district, there is a lot of food insecurity, there's a huge need for childcare,\" he said. \"So when Zohran speaks about affordability, it speaks straight to our communities.\"\"At the same time, voter turnout in the community is really low,\" he said, noting he helped organise a roundtable with West African imams in the community and Mamdani. \"So I've really been working to increase those numbers\".At the same time, the vitriol that Mamdani has received, particularly related to his religion, race and immigration history, has crescendoed in the final days of the race.In the final week of campaigning, two House Republicans, Randy Fine and Andy Ogles, have continued to push the US Department of Justice to investigate Mamdani's immigration status and potentially strip his citizenship.But Latifa Emery, a 44-year-old from the Morrisania neighbourhood of the Bronx, said those attacks could backfire, instead energising communities long accustomed to being demonised.\"If he wins, a lot of people will start to realise that we aren't what everybody says we are,\" said Emery, who is Muslim. \"We're not terrorists, we're not bad people. It's time for people to see that\".In the nearby Tremont neighbourhood, Masoud Eleshin, a 78-year-old originally from Ghana, took issue with Cuomo's attempts to connect Mamdani to anti-LGBTQ policies in the country where he was born, Uganda.That has included attacking Mamdani for taking a photo with Rebecca Kadaga, a proponent of anti-gay laws. Mamdani has flatly condemned Kadaga's position, saying he was not aware of her views at the time the photo was taken.Back on the canvassing grind in Crown Heights, both the pitfalls and potential of reaching new voters were on full display.\"You're wasting your time in this neighbourhood,\" the man said. \"[Mamdani] is an antisemite, he wants me dead\".Wood attempted to calm the situation, seeking to dispel a claim pushed by both Cuomo and Sliwa. A range of Jewish New Yorkers have backed Mamdani, who has repeatedly vowed to be a Mayor for all city residents.One of two major ultra-orthodox Satmar sects in the city has also recently rejected claims that Mamdani is antisemitic as \"false and dangerous\".But after a quick talk with Wood, she was swiftly taken by two of Mamdani's top pledges: A rent freeze, which would theoretically apply to her apartment, and universal childcare.","headline":"Zohran Mamdani supporters make final campaign push: Why him, why now?","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/30/zohran-mamdani-supporters-make-final-campaign-push-why-him-why-now","message":"As November 4 election day approaches, volunteers make mad-dash push for historic New York City mayoral candidate.

Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.Two weeks ago, Andrew gave up the use of his titles and honors, more than five years after stepping back as a frontline royal. He said he was putting “duty to my family and country first” but it did little to stop the snowballing scandal.Then on Thursday evening, a brusque bombshell announcement from Buckingham Palace: Andrew is to lose his princely status, and effective immediately he is plain old Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, a commoner.The significance of Charles’ moves on Thursday cannot be overstated, with royal historian Kate Williams describing them as “unprecedented.”“This is a huge move from the royal family. Just recently, the King announced that Andrew was stepping back from the title Duke of York just a few days before Mrs. Giuffre’s memoir was published. But that simply wasn’t enough for public opinion,” she said.It is the ultimate humiliation for the 65-year-old royal, who is known to enjoy the trappings and privilege of royal life. He will move out of Royal Lodge, his sprawling mansion in the heart of the Windsor estate just outside of London, as soon as is practicable and be exiled to the countryside to live in obscurity.Andrew is understood not to have objected to his brother’s actions, but it also seems unlikely that he had any choice. It was not just the public that had expressed outrage and frustration; there had also been increasing calls for Andrew to appear before a parliamentary committee.The King’s moves were welcomed by many politicians late on Thursday. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said that “the King has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family” but added that it “must have been a very difficult thing” to act against his own sibling.Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey said Andrew’s situation “had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.”He added, “This is an important step towards rebuilding trust in our institutions and drawing a line under this whole sorry saga.”For several weeks, it has felt like some sort of announcement was coming down the pike and was simply a case of when, rather than if.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace statement said.Meanwhile, royal sources have told CNN that the King was trying to act swiftly following recent developments but had needed some time to consult legal and constitutional experts.It is also understood that the King took action in light of his sibling’s serious lapses of judgment and has the support of the wider family, including Prince William.This would have been a very difficult decision, deeply personal given the family dynamics at play. The negotiations to get here will have been challenging but the monarch had to go into damage control.For many people in the country, and certainly critics of the royal family, these moves might not be enough to rehabilitate the monarchy’s tarnished reputation. Already some on social media are saying the removal of Andrew’s status as prince only goes so far. Other critics say the family has shielded Andrew over the years, and pressure for some sort of accountability needs to continue.“Losing silly titles is not an answer to very serious accusations of sexual offenses and corruption in public office,” Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said following the palace’s announcement.“This isn’t about William and Charles taking a tough line. It’s about William and Charles protecting their position by putting as much distance between them and Andrew as they can,” Smith added. “We need to see Andrew face justice, because we need to know that the royals are not above the law.”Despite being stripped of his prince title, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. Royal sources have told CNN that he will be given a house on the King’s private estate in Sandringham, and will receive an income from Charles as well.His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has been living with Andrew at Royal Lodge for the last two decades, is moving out as well and is understood to be making her own arrangements.It’s not yet clear if the King’s actions will be enough to give a public perception that the situation has been handled, but Charles seems to be doing as much as he feels he can within his own royal prerogative.","headline":"King Charles has finally banished his brother.

At the end of the day, the US could find itself holding a pile of pesos worth much less than they were originally.The intervention in Argentina was a highly unusual move - especially from a White House known for its \"America First\" approach.Milei has endeared himself to conservatives in the US with his embrace of free-market reforms and radical spending cuts. He has met frequently with Trump, who has called him his \"favourite president\".But the US has rarely offered financial bailouts to other countries - especially in a case that posed no wider financial stability risks - and direct purchases of a struggling emerging market currency are unprecedented, says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Few are positioned to be as aware of the potential pitfalls as Bessent, who made his name as a currency trader working for George Soros.This time, Bessent finds himself on the opposite side of similar gamble. He has defended his moves, invoking the spectre of fellow South American country, Venezuela, and arguing that failure to shore up Argentina as a US ally could lead to destabilisation in the region.\"These results are a clear example that the Trump Administration policy of Peace through Economic Strength is working,\" Bessent wrote on social media after the recent election in Argentina.On Wednesday, Bessent posted again to say: \"the Argentine economic bridge has now turned a profit for the American people\".But it has kept quiet about key information needed to assess Bessent's claims - including the timeline and scale of its peso purchases - or sales - and what, if any, other assets the Argentine government pledged in order to secure the swap deal.But Democrats have criticised the help at a time of White House spending cuts and an ongoing government shutdown, accusing Bessent of wanting to protect finance \"buddies\" with investments in the country.Even some members of Trump's own Republican Party have questioned how the aid aligns with the president's \"America First\" goals.Bessent has disputed any characterisation of the US support for Argentina as a \"bailout\", promising there will be \"no taxpayer losses\" and even declaring the peso \"undervalued\".To the contrary - most analysts say the peso is overvalued, but has been propped up by support from the Argentine central bank, which set trading limits for the peso in April.Economists say maintaining such limits is not sustainable. They cite the surge in Argentines travelling to make purchases in neighbouring countries where their money travels farther as one of the signs that the peso is being held artificially high.The Argentine central bank has insisted it is committed to the trading band, which was intended to protect the country from wild currency swings destabilising prices and support Milei's efforts to control inflation.But it has already had to spend billions buying pesos to keep the currency steady, burning through International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding and dipping into its foreign reserves, which are key to paying its debt obligations.Economists say they expect the bank will have to change its policy to allow the peso to fall more - or the country risks needing another bailout.\"Is the US willing to provide support to Argentina so that Argentina can defend the peso at this level?\" Mr Setser asks. \"Bessent has to decide in a sense whether to double down... or he has to let the peso adjust and recognise that his intervention was a bridge to the election.\"The peso plummeted ahead of the midterms, as businesses and households in Argentina rushed to trade the currency for dollars.\"Every single guy that I talked to, they wanted to buy dollars... they have very fresh memories about that,\" he said, describing the run as a \"confidence crisis.\"And Mr Bagües says there are too many policy questions ahead to predict what will happen to the peso.Kathryn Exum, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy Funds Management, suggests that the peso could rise \"over the medium term\" if the government is able to continue advancing economic reforms.For now, Anthony Simond, investment director on the emerging market debt team at Aberdeen Group, says he expects the peso has farther to fall.\"Bessent may say one thing, but I think the economic reality may force them to be a little bit more flexible in terms of currency management,\" he says.The US government shutdown continues, with Republicans and Democrats no closer to ending their budget standoff.","headline":"The US bet big with Argentina bailout - is it paying off?","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3mdvle78o","message":"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been the point-person entrusted with selling financial markets on some of President Donald Trump's riskiest economic gambles: sweeping global tariffs, trade talks with China and preparations to install a new leader at the US central bank.

The two agreed to a truce in May, but tensions remained high.Thursday's talks did not lead to a formal agreement but the announcements suggest they are closer to a deal - the details of which have long been subject to behind-the-scenes negotiations.Trade deals normally take years to negotiate. Countries around the world have been thrown into resolving differences with Trump within a matter of months, after he imposed sweeping tariffs - or import taxes - on some of his top trade partners.China has agreed to suspend export control measures it had placed on rare earths, crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets. This has been seen as a key win for Trump from his meeting with Xi.A jubilant Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he had also got China to start immediately buying a \"tremendous amounts of soybeans and other farm products\". Retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans by Beijing had effectively halted imports from the US, harming US farmers - who constitute a key voting block for Trump.In the immediate aftermath of the meeting, the US also said it would drop part of the tariffs it has levied on Beijing over the flow of ingredients used in making fentanyl to the US. Trump has imposed severe tariffs on China, as well as Canada and Mexico, for their perceived failure to clamp down on the flow of that drug.The president of the US-China Business Council welcomed the news on tariffs and rare earths, describing these as the most significant outcome of the talks.Speaking to Business Today from Beijing, Mr Stein said this \"gives business plenty of time to work on the Chinese and the US administration to make sure that they're focused on some of the long-standing issues that have troubled the trade relationship between the two countries.\"More positively for Beijing, it will now be able to speak to Jensen Huang, the head of US tech firm Nvidia - according to Trump. Nvidia is at the heart of the two countries' fight over AI chips: China wants high-end chips but the US wants to limit China's access, citing national security.Beijing has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit China in April - yet another sign of thawing relations.There was, however, no mention of a breakthrough on TikTok. The US has sought to take the video-sharing app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Beijing said afterwards it would continue to work to resolve the issues.Xi was self-contained, and said only what he had prepared. He entered the meeting knowing he had a strong hand. China had learned from Trump's first term, leveraging its chokehold on rare earths, and diversifying its trade partners so it is less reliant on the US.Afterwards, he was far more measured in his language than Trump. The two sides would be working on delivering outcomes that will serve as a \"reassuring pill\" for both countries' economies, he said.Trump was - as always - more ad-lib. But the US president was also noticeably more tense than he had been for the rest of his whirlwind trip to South East Asia - a reflection of the high stakes in Thursday's meeting.The glamour and pageantry on show since he arrived at his first stop in Malaysia just five days ago was also absent.Gone were the gold-laden palaces of the sort he was welcomed to in Japan on Tuesday. Instead, a building at an airport, lying behind barbed wire and security checkpoints.Instead, the only sign something important was going on inside was the heavy police and media presence.Henry Wang, a former adviser to China's State Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump and Xi's talks \"went very well\".It may not have been a trade deal, but a \"framework and structure has been laid\", he added - calling it \"a good start\".Officials investigated after hearing complaints from real drug traffickers about having to pay bribes to officers.The men are accused of running a drug ring in New York City that sold counterfeit prescription opioid pills through social media.Thousands of US adoptees do not have citizenship despite being brought to the country as babies decades ago.

Datasembly said Halloween discounts on all candy brands started earlier this year, were deeper and covered more items than in the past.These include products from Mondelez (MDLZ.O), opens new tab, which makes Sour Patch Kids sweets, and Mars, home of M&M's and Skittles, as well as Hershey, famous for Kisses and KitKat bars.A Hershey spokesperson said that its seasonal candy - like pumpkin-shaped Reese's - had significantly fewer discounts this year than last year.Halloween candy shopping continues throughout October, and the data cited by Jeffries covered all Hershey products which include salty snacks.Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner said on Thursday that Halloween sales were \"somewhat soft,\" and he cited warmer weather and the timing of the holiday later in the week.Retail candy prices still do not cover that historic rise so manufacturers are trying to pass on costs to consumers in an effort to restore profit margins.Halloween and seasonal occasions like Easter and Valentine's Day are especially important for confectioners because consumers budget for holiday treats.\"It’s make or break for our seasonal business,\" said Chantal Butler, Mondelez president of North American confectionery.Consumers love holiday treats but right now want they want \"the best bang for their buck and are waiting for promotions.

The activities officially aim to “combat anti-Semitism” – a term often deployed by the Israeli government to counter criticism of its genocidal war on Gaza.In its filing, Clock Tower promises to use AI modelling to ensure that the Israeli-supervised campaign – and by extension narratives – are prominent online during the course of its war on Gaza.“If you can create enough online noise, through either social media or highly ranked websites, you’re able to influence AI’s large language models [like ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok],” said Marc Owen Jones, an associate professor of media analytics and an expert in disinformation at Northwestern University Qatar.“LLMs [large language models] are trained on a set amount of data, where they scrape large amounts of [historical] information. However, many models such as Grok, ChatGPT or Gemini use what they call retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where they also pull contemporary data from websites and social media,” Jones said.“What companies like Clock Tower X are promising is that, if they can flood the information space with sites and content sympathetic to Israel – what’s called RAG poisoning –  there’ll be enough there to at least muddy the waters around what others see as a clear-cut genocide.”Clock Tower, headed by former Donald Trump aide Brad Parscale, also says that much of this content will be integrated with that of right-wing Christian network Salem Media, which in April announced a strategic partnership with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.The campaign promised by Bridges Partners has already become the source of an online meme – but not in the way the company or Israel would have been hoping.The number has been quickly seized upon by detractors of Israel, who regularly post the amount underneath posts they suspect of being part of the pro-Israel campaign, indicating that they believe the poster has been “bought” by Israel.Responsible Statecraft reported earlier this month that the anonymity of the US influencers, who under the terms of their agreements would post paid pro-Israel content since July, could potentially be illegal if their identities remain undisclosed.It is too early to say whether the campaign will ultimately be successful. But the backlash towards the arrangement once it became public illustrates just how difficult the task will be for Israel to change perceptions that have now become deeply ingrained, particularly among younger people.“No matter what artificial data is produced, it still won’t be enough to counter the volume of factual reporting of the war on Gaza,” Jones said.“However, there might be enough to promote a sense of ambiguity over it, to present both sides as more equal in the conflict, or to present Israel’s response to the attack of October 7 as more reasonable than some now think it is.”Al Jazeera has been unable to contact Bridges Partners, Clock Tower X, or Show Faith by Works for comment.Inquiries to the Israeli chief of staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eran Shayovich, and to Havas Media Group have also gone unanswered.In part two of this investigation, to be published on Friday, Al Jazeera will be looking at why Israel is so focused on changing perceptions of it in the United States.","headline":"Spinning genocide: How is Israel using US PR firms to frame its Gaza war?","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/30/spinning-genocide-how-israel-is-using-us-pr-firms-to-frame-its-gaza-war","message":"Israel has contracted three US public relations companies to help it win back American hearts and minds.

The royal family will have hoped Andrew’s decision to give up the use of his royal titles and honors would put an end to the saga. But it was not enough.Once celebrated as a decorated war hero, Andrew, the brother of King Charles III, has been thrown into the royal wilderness, not even invited to spend Christmas with his family at their Sandringham estate, and now unceremoniously stripped of his titles and booted out of his home.It remains unclear what the royal family, or other members of the royal household, knew about the extent of Andrew’s relationship with Epstein, and when they knew it.Both his staff and his security detail would have been aware of his movements at the time he associated with Epstein. But the royal family has not commented publicly on any of that.Andrew’s behavior put King Charles in a difficult position: effectively banish his brother as a royal outcast or allow the steady drumbeat of negative headlines to risk further reputational damage to the institution.Andrew said the decision was made in consultation with King Charles, as well as other members of the family, because the “continued accusations” were distracting from the family’s work. “I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first,” he added.And there’s the rub – keeping it in the family means he did not give up the titles; he merely gave up use of them, and so technically he still held all of them.In the end, Charles decided to take the extraordinary step on Thursday of moving to formally take away Andrew’s titles and honors.The monarch is understood to be sending royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor to remove Andrew’s Duke of York title from the Peerage Roll, as well as the title prince and the honorific styling of “Royal Highness.” Andrew’s other subsidiary titles – Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh – are dealt with in the same way.Andrew became a prince automatically at birth, as the son of the then reigning monarch, and that status can only be changed if King Charles issues a directive known as a Letters Patent.Profits from the estate are paid to the British government and further outrage was ignited after it was revealed that the terms of the rental agreement effectively mean Andrew has never paid rent on the accommodation.After those upfront costs, the lease states he has since paid an annual rent of “one peppercorn (if demanded),” a copy of the Royal Lodge leasehold agreement showed.Regardless, there had been mounting pressure on Andrew to leave the property, which sits in Windsor Great Park close to a chapel used by the royals.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, wrote to the Crown Estate and Treasury to seek further information on Royal Lodge. “This forms part of our long-standing remit, on behalf of Parliament and the British public, to examine the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of public spending, and ensure the taxpayer is receiving best value for money,” he said in a statement.A YouGov poll published in October revealed that four in five Britons would support Andrew being formally stripped of his dukedom.The Palace may have felt that it had no option but to order Andrew to leave the residence, given the increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the brewing scandal.Andrew has also faced furious questions over his business deals with China and his contact with an alleged Chinese spy. Court documents revealed the disgraced royal’s apparently close relationship with Yang Tengbo.Andrew’s office said at the time that he ceased his relationship with Yang after receiving government advice.Meanwhile, fresh documents released this year revealed that Andrew sent birthday wishes each year to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A witness statement from a former aide to the royal revealed that Andrew had a “communication channel” with China through Yang but insisted that there was “nothing to hide.”","headline":"The unanswered questions hanging over the Andrew scandal","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/22/uk/prince-andrew-scandal-unanswered-questions-intl","message":"There has been an avalanche of headlines coinciding with the publication of a posthumous memoir, “Nobody’s Girl,” by Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre.

The BBC has not independently verified this.\"There are a number of sites whose traffic has grown exponentially, and these are sites that are not complying,\" she said.She told the BBC of one which seemed to encourage users to search for content featuring girls below the age of consent.The regulator has defended the way it enforces the new rules, saying increasing traffic to sites can be one factor that triggers an investigation.\"Sites that don't comply and put children at risk can expect to face enforcement action,\" it told BBC News.The government has also defended the regulator, and said protecting children online was a \"top priority\" for ministers.\"Where evidence shows further intervention is needed to protect children, we will not hesitate to act,\" it added in a statement.Ms Kekesi spoke to the BBC while in the UK for a meeting with Ofcom and government officials, where she has been making Pornhub's case that age checks should be done at device level, rather than by individual websites.A number of jurisdictions have sought to compel Pornhub to check its users' ages, but the response of the site has been to block users rather than comply.Ms Kekesi said the UK was different because it allowed sites to offer a range of different solutions, meaning that Pornhub could use methods - such as email-based checks - which didn't require collecting biometric data.She denied that the threat of hefty fines for non-compliance had been the primary motive for complying, pointing to the contrast with France - its second biggest market - where it had cut off access rather than agreeing to what regulators demanded.Ian Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association rejected calls for a switch to device-based verification.But he added the group shared a desire for a \"level playing field\" meaning age checks should be \"robust, not superficial or fake\".Chelsea Jarvie, a cybersecurity company founder who has been researching methods of age assurance for a PhD at Strathclyde University, told the BBC both approaches to age checks would be needed - with neither age verification on platforms nor devices being a \"silver bullet\".\"For somebody to truly be safe online we need different layers of controls throughout their browsing journey,\" she said.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

This could be a consequence of people reducing their porn use but could also be partly explained by people visiting the site through alternative means such as a VPN, which masks a user's location.

This apparatus not only sustains conservative inertia but also defines the limits of what is considered possible in policy. In Sudan’s two-and-a-half-year conflict, these self-imposed boundaries are proving fatal.A particularly insidious practice within the Blob is the invocation of moral and rhetorical equivalence, portraying the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) as comparable adversaries. This ostensibly balanced US stance, evident in establishment analyses and diplomatic statements, represents not an impartial default but a deliberate political construct. By equating a criminalised, externally backed militia with a national army tasked with state duties, it sanitises RSF atrocities, recasting them as mere wartime exigencies rather than orchestrated campaigns of ethnic cleansing, urban sieges and terror.This notion has dominated US and international discourse on Sudan’s war since its outbreak when the then-US ambassador to Khartoum, John Godfrey, tweeted in the first month of the war a condemnation of RSF sexual violence but vaguely attributed it to unspecified “armed actors”. By refraining from explicitly identifying the perpetrators despite extensive documentation of the RSF’s responsibility for systematic rapes, gang rapes and sexual slavery, his wording essentially dispersed accountability across the warring parties and contributed to a climate of institutional impunity. RSF militiamen carry out their atrocities with confidence, knowing that responsibility will be blurred and its burden scattered across the parties.What drives this equivalence? The Blob’s institutions often prioritise access over veracity. Framing the conflict symmetrically safeguards diplomatic ties with regional allies, particularly the RSF’s patrons in the United Arab Emirates while projecting an aura of neutrality. However, neutrality amid asymmetric criminality is not objectivity; it is tacit complicity. Elevating an internationally enabled militia to parity with a sovereign military confers undue legitimacy on the RSF, whose methods – including the besieging and starving of cities such as el-Fasher, the systematic use of rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war, the deployment of drones against mosques and markets, and acts of genocide – are demonstrably systematic, as corroborated by investigative journalism and human rights documentation. To subsume these under “actions by both parties” distorts empirical reality and erodes mechanisms for accountability.Compounding this is the Blob’s uncritical assimilation of RSF propaganda into its interpretive frameworks. The RSF has strategically positioned itself as a vanguard against “Islamists”, a veneer that conceals its historical criminal nature, patronage networks, illicit resource extraction and foreign sponsorship.In a similar vein, the RSF has publicly expressed sympathy and strong support for Israel, even offering to resettle displaced Palestinians from Gaza in a bid to align with US interests. This discourse serves as an overture to the Blob, leveraging shared geopolitical priorities to portray the RSF as a pragmatic partner in regional stability.Certain establishment pundits and diplomats have echoed this narrative, casting the RSF as a viable bulwark against an “Islamist resurgence”, thereby endowing a force implicated in war crimes with strategic and ethical credibility. When the Blob internalises this “anti-Islamist” trope as analytical shorthand, it legitimises an insurgent militia’s rationalisations as geopolitical truths, marginalising the reality of the war and the Sudanese who repudiate militarised binaries and sectarian lenses.Contrast this with the recurrent accusations of external backing for the SAF from an ideologically disparate coalition, including Egypt, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Iran. These claims, often amplified in mainstream media narratives and aligning with RSF discourse, expose profound inconsistencies: Egypt’s secular anti-Islamist state, Turkiye’s Islamist-leaning government, Saudi Arabia’s Sunni Wahhabi monarchy and Iran’s Shia theocracy embody clashing regional rivalries, evident in proxy wars from Yemen to Libya, rendering their purported unified support for the SAF implausible unless opportunistic pragmatism overrides ideology.Moreover, the evidentiary threshold falls short of the robust, independent documentation implicating the UAE in RSF operations, relying instead on partisan assertions and circumstantial reports that appear designed to muddy asymmetries. Critically, any verified SAF assistance typically involves conventional arms transactions with Sudan’s internationally recognised government in Port Sudan, a sovereign authority, as opposed to the unchecked provisioning extended to the RSF, a nonstate actor formally designated by the US as genocidal. This fundamental distinction highlights the Blob’s contrived equivalence, conflating legitimate state-to-state engagements with the illicit empowerment of atrocity perpetrators.Even more corrosive is the Blob’s propensity to credential “pseudo-civilian” entities aligned with the RSF and its external sponsors, particularly those bolstered by UAE influence, such as Somoud, led by former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who also chairs the Emirati business-promotion organisation, the Centre for Africa’s Development and Investment (CADI). These networks are often presented in Blob forums as “civilian stakeholders” or “pragmatic moderates”, sidelining authentic grassroots entities inside Sudan.This curation of externally amenable proxies transforms mediation into theatre, channelling international validation towards RSF-aligned gains and ignoring Sudanese agency rather than supporting any real civic architects of Sudan’s democratic aspirations. Documented UAE-RSF logistical and political linkages alongside Gulf-orchestrated narrative amplification should serve as a warning against endorsing such fabricated authority.These lapses are not merely intellectual; they yield tangible harms. Legitimising the RSF through equivalence or narrative cooption dilutes legal and political tools for redress, confining policy options to performative ceasefires and superficial stability blueprints that preserve war economies and armament flows. It defers genuine deterrence, such as targeted interdictions, robust arms embargoes and the exposure of enablers until atrocities become irreversible.The repercussions do not end there. They deepen, fuelling the militia’s authoritarian ambitions in alliance with its civilian partners. Drawing on this contrived equivalence, they have recently declared Ta’asis, parallel governing structures in western Sudan, claiming a layer of legitimacy while, at least rhetorically, brandishing the threat of partition despite the clear international consensus against recognising such authority.To counter the Blob’s pathologies, a paradigm shift is imperative. Analysts and policymakers must abjure false symmetry, distinguishing symmetric warfare from asymmetric atrocity campaigns. Where evidence is found of systematic rights abuses, international rhetoric and actions should reflect this imbalance through targeted sanctions and disruptions while avoiding generic “both-sides” statements.Equally important is to withhold recognition from contrived civilians. Mediation roles should hinge on verifiable grassroots mandates. Entities tethered to foreign patrons or militias merit no elevation as Sudan’s representatives.Finally, policymakers must dismantle enablers. Rhetorical and legal measures must be matched by enforcement through transparent embargo oversight, flight interdictions and sanctions on supply chains. Justice without implementation offers only solace to victims.Should the Blob prove intransigent, alternative forces must intervene. Sudanese civic coalitions, diaspora advocates, independent media and ethical policy networks can amass evidence and exert pressure to compel a recalibration of global approaches. A diplomacy that cloaks complicity in neutrality perpetuates atrocity machinery. Only one anchored in Sudanese agency, empirical truth and unyielding accountability can forge a viable peace.Sudanese seek no sympathy, only a recalibration among the influential: Cease equating aggressors with guardians, amplifying perpetrator propaganda and supplanting vibrant civic realities with orchestrated facades. Until Washington’s elite perceives Sudanese not as geopolitical subjects but as rights-bearing citizens demanding justice, its epistemic maze will continue to license carnage over conciliation.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.","headline":"The Blob’s dangerous neutrality: How Washington misreads Sudan’s war","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/30/washingtons-blob-is-helping-whitewash-sudans-war-crimes","message":"By equating an internationally backed militia with a national army, the US establishment distorts reality and erases Sudanese agency.

If you have heart and circulatory disease, it can help you manage your condition and make you feel better overall.\"You may find it hard to be more active at first, but as time goes on it'll get easier as your body gets used to the activity.

He later denied to Reuters any link between the lyrics and the Nazis.The private reception in Manhattan, hosted by the New York Young Republican Club, underscores the AfD’s efforts to build international legitimacy and challenge what it calls undemocratic exclusion at home.“We have no democracy anymore,” Gottschalk told attendees. “You can’t say what you think or what you like.”The AfD’s growing ties in Washington come as it surges in German opinion polls, threatening Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives ahead of a series of state elections next year that polls suggest could give the AfD its first state premier.\"It's a calculated opportunity to ... attract attention and achieve a proximity to government power that would be completely unthinkable in the concert of European or other states,\" said Oliver Lembcke, political scientist at the University of Bochum, referring to the AfD's series of meetings in the U.S.The State Department did not comment but pointed to a photo, opens new tab on X of Darren Beattie, the senior foreign service official, meeting with Wenzel Schmidt and his colleague Markus Frohnmaier.The State Department official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media, said: \"When you have an organisation that's outside the mainstream, they crave the imprimatur of legitimacy that historically engaging with American diplomats has offered them.\"Germany's other parties refuse to work with its lawmakers by giving them influential positions in parliament or forming coalitions.That pact – known as the firewall – is undemocratic, the AfD argues. AfD politicians say they want to raise awareness about what they view as the worsening state of democracy in Germany, and gain high-profile backing abroad.So far, they have struggled. The AfD is shunned by many of Europe's other far-right parties after a series of scandals and inflammatory comments. But, with the return of Trump to the White House, the AfD has found a sympathetic ear.In February, U.S. Vice President JD Vance shocked European leaders by accusing them of censoring free speech, repressing political rivals and failing to control immigration.Vance then met with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel in a sign of support shortly before federal German elections, where they came in an unprecedented second place.In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the party's classification as extremist was tyranny in disguise.\"The AfD pounces on it whenever these comments come out, and they use it to pressure the government,\" the German government official said. \"This is a problem because outwardly we want and need good relations with Americans, and this sabotages it.\"The AfD's grievances include wire-tapping by authorities, moves to bar AfD members from the civil service and undemocratic attempts to exclude them from power, they told Reuters.German intelligence earlier this year found the AfD to be \"extremist\" in part due to racist and anti-Muslim views. The designation allows the state to recruit informants and intercept communications and allows authorities to bar members deemed disloyal to the constitution from the civil service.AfD politician Joachim Paul said the State Department had invited him to “explain the situation of the opposition in Germany” after he was barred from running for a mayoral position. German authorities had cited doubts about his loyalty to the country’s constitutional order.Paul said the U.S. officials he met in Washington were well-informed and told him they would follow his case. However, he added, they stopped short of offering direct assistance.The foundation for the AfD's ties with the U.S. government was laid in the years running up to Trump's re-election.The New York Young Republican Club has for years cultivated contacts with far-right European parties.Before joining government, Wax met with right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at a May gathering of nationalist parties in Budapest also attended by the AfD's Weidel.\"In previous administrations, whether Democratic or Republican, the State Department didn't swing too much left or right,\" said the former State Department official. \"Now that's changing.\"Frohnmaier, one of the AfD lawmakers photographed meeting Beattie, welcomed the U.S. interest in the party's challenges.It is \"our duty to raise awareness among democratic partners abroad about these developments, so that the anti-democratic forces in Germany encounter resistance from all sides,\" he said.","headline":"On the rise in Germany, far-right AfD deepens ties to Trump administration","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rise-germany-far-right-afd-deepens-ties-trump-administration-2025-10-30/","message":"The Alternative for Germany (AfD), classified as extremist by Germany's domestic intelligence service and ostracised by mainstream parties, has held meetings with senior U.

The obsessive, brilliant Victor Frankenstein builds a horrifying creature from cadavers, abandons it in disgust, then suffers a terrible fate as his creation, left alone in the world and inspiring fear in everyone it comes across, enacts a terrible revenge.\"I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy...\"The final sections of the book took Shelley back to Scotland, if only in her imagination. Victor travels through Edinburgh, Perth and St Andrews to settle in Orkney, where he seeks the solitude and inspiration to build a second creature - a female companion for the vengeful one that follows him.\"It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for it inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.\"Thankfully, the crew behind the new Frankenstein found today's Scotland much more suited to their filming needs.Art director and production designer Tamara Deverell is a long-time collaborator of Guillermo Del Toro's. The Canadian was Oscar-nominated for her work on his film Nightmare Alley.\"It's in Italy, Switzerland, all over the world. I spent months looking all around Croatia and Hungary but then we decided we could do most of it in the UK.\"\"Guillermo was still writing but we were gasping at all this architecture and that allowed us to visually create the film,\" she says.\"We were looking for neighbourhoods, rather than specific buildings, but we couldn't help finding inspiration in everything we saw.\"I went to every close along the Royal Mile and then I selected a few to show to Guillermo. It's just so fantastic to be able to shoot right in the heart of the Royal Mile.\"Two years later, the production filmed in Parliament Square, Writers' Close and the Canongate. But aspects of other Scottish landmarks also made it into the final film, inspiring the looks of the interior sets, which were built in Toronto.\"You can't help but notice that our water tower with its pinnacles is partly based on the Wallace Monument in Stirling and the Scott Monument in Edinburgh.Popular filming locations such as Gosford House in East Lothian stood in for the Frankenstein family home.\"We looked in the main space and although it was magnificent, it was just too big for the intimate confessional scene we wanted to shoot,\" Tamara says.\"The arches were all too high. You had no sense of the scale of the place. And then I realised Outlander had shot scenes in the lower chapel where the Gothic arches are much closer to the ground.Tamara credits these places with inspiring the director to create new scenes and build the story around what they found.The production team absorbed the spooky atmosphere of the places they stayed, such as Norwood Hall Hotel in Aberdeen.Del Toro wrote on social media that his colleague had witnessed strange electrical and physical phenomena inside room nine and the director had snapped up the chance to stay in the haunted bed chamber.\"Scotland is so old.

Assistant Professor of Indigenous Studies at Concordia University.Last month, the right-leaning populist government of Canada’s French-speaking province of Quebec finally scrapped a controversial forestry bill. Known as Bill 97, this proposed legislation was aimed at significantly increasing the volume of timber extracted from the province’s forests.It envisioned handing over at least one-third of the province’s forests for exclusive use by private industrial logging interests while another third would have been open to logging but would have also permitted other activities, including recreation. The remaining third would have been for conservation.The bill faced stiff opposition from civil society and Indigenous people. Months of organised, broad-based resistance paid off.The bill was abandoned, but the fact that it was even proposed to begin with is an indication of where the priorities of the governing Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) coalition lie. It believes that it is justifiable to bulldoze over environmental regulations, climate action and Indigenous rights to serve the interests of the logging lobby. It clearly espouses Trumpian politics, even if it officially denounces the United States president.Important lessons can be learned from the fight against Bill 97 to ensure that Indigenous voices are not ignored again and similar legislation is not passed.When Bill 97 was introduced, the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador (AFNQL) issued an immediate rejection. It argued that for more than a year, it had consulted with the government on forest management and given it recommendations, which were completely ignored. The bill directly infringed on the rights of Indigenous people as it sought to prepare unceded lands for takeover by the logging industry.Seeing the destructive potential of the bill while it was still being drafted, groups of Innu, Abenaki and Anishinaabe land defenders joined the Nehirowisiw to form the MAMO Alliance. MAMO means “together” in the Nehirowisiw and Innu languages.Quebec’s civil society also sprang into action. Environmental groups, wildlife biologists, fish and game outfitters, industry labour unions and artists also voiced opposition. University students and social justice collectives in Montreal organised support for the blockades.This cross-societal mobilisation made it impossible for the government to rely on its usual rhetoric that pits “unreasonable and hostile natives” against the wellbeing of settler society.Bill 97 also demonstrated the dangers of what we call bulldozer environmentalism: claiming that the destruction of nature can have an environmentally positive outcome.The introduction of Bill 97 was accompanied by claims of its environmental benefits that did not add up. For example, Maite Blanchette Vezina, the minister of natural resources and forests for the CAQ, who resigned just before the bill was scrapped, claimed that handing forests over for intensive logging in priority management zones would be a “better” way to sequester carbon and would “vaccinate the forests from the impacts of climate change”.However, environmental research contradicts the notion that logging mature and old-growth forests generates more carbon storage potential. One recent study, for example, concluded that mature “forests store far more carbon per hectare than younger forests” and preserving such forests can help sequester significant amounts of carbon.Under the veneer of environmental concern in Bill 97, we saw a familiar colonial mindset, which embraces the idea of treating land as a purely economic resource and not as a living ecosystem. Dividing up forests into zones to re-engineer them for economic purposes reflects a colonial, extractive and Eurocentric understanding of the world. This contrasts with Indigenous knowledge of the land as an interconnected whole. This means that protecting one part of the land only to destroy another part is incompatible with Indigenous worldviews.In this sense, Bill 97 was no different from other destructive legislation recently put forward. One example is Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s Protect Ontario by Unleashing our Economy Act, or Bill 5, which seeks to accelerate mineral extraction projects framed as being of “strategic importance” by gutting environmental protections and respect for constitutionally protected Indigenous rights. It also empowers the government to create special economic zones, where existing social and environmental regulations would be able to be revoked.Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Bill C-5, which would allow the government to fast-track major projects by circumventing environmental protections, is similar legislation applied at the national level.Such bills aim to give private industries the right to make decisions on how to exploit public lands, all in the name of national security and a Trumpian “build, baby, build” mentality. From “sovereign” artificial intelligence data centres to liquified natural gas pipelines and mining projects, Canada is rushing headfirst to hand over land and give carte blanche to extractive industries to do as they please.In the process, it’s even doing away with the typical performative theatre of consultations with First Nations and other stakeholders, implementing gag orders, stifling dissent, ignoring legal judgements, outright dismissing environmental impact assessments or parliamentary debates, and ignoring prior legislations on Indigenous peoples’ rights.Celebrating the end of Bill 97 is premature. A revised forestry reform bill is expected within a year. The CAQ government is likely to propose something similar or even more draconian in the months ahead.That is why advocacy needs to continue and focus on taking priority logging zones for industry off the table. Forest management must be made truly collaborative by involving independent coalitions of Indigenous people, ecologists, labour unions and rural outfitters who live and work on the land and know the forest best.The government and its industry backers should not be allowed to manage Quebec’s forests. Under no circumstances should logging be permitted in habitat identified as sensitive for threatened species like the woodland caribou.Finally, prioritising the ancestral rights of Indigenous communities to the territory must be part of what caring for the forest means.Responsible forestry reform is not to say trees should not be cut for timber. A world where concrete and plastic replace wood products would be disastrous. Responsible timber management is possible and can be achieved while ensuring forest regeneration.In the face of global ecological crises that spawn wildfires, climate change, mass extinction and threaten our future collective wellbeing, forest management means caring for the land as a creator of life and not simply a creator of wealth.

They found that the tomatoes on the eastern islands had a modern defense system, implying that the younger, western plants were not left behind on the species’ evolutionary journey, but instead displayed a possible case of “reverse evolution.”“It’s not very common to see reverse evolution,” said Adam Jozwiak, a molecular biochemist at the University of California, Riverside, who was part of the team that made the discovery. The scientists reported their findings in June in the journal Nature Communications.“We think that maybe environmental conditions put the pressure on these tomatoes to revert back to original or to ancestral state,” Jozwiak said, adding that the finding “shows that nature is very flexible, and it’s not the way we thought — that everything goes only forward.”While the fruit of the western plants looked slightly different — with a purplish color and darker vines instead of their usual bright and warm hues — the biggest differences between them and tomatoes from the eastern islands was found on a molecular level.By studying these molecules and investigating why the tomatoes have reverted to ancient genes, scientists could design better crops for eating, stronger pesticides or even medicine, Jozwiak said. It could also help researchers further understand evolution in various species, including humans — and whether it is more flexible than once thought.On the eastern islands, the environment is more stable and biologically diverse, whereas the younger islands have a barren landscape with less developed soil. The toxic molecular cocktail of the tomatoes with the ancient genes not only helps the plants ward off predators, but Jozwiak hypothesizes, it could also help the roots collect more nutrients or possibly protect them from disease.When analyzing the tomatoes, the researchers found that it was a very simple change in the makeup of the amino acids that caused the plant to revert to its ancestral traits. Then, they genetically modified tobacco plants in the same way to observe the production of the ancestral compounds and confirm how it works.But further study is needed to understand the benefit of this transformation — and why the reversion is occurring in the first place, Jozwiak said.The case of Solanum pennellii sheds light on how plants evolve diverse chemistry under different conditions, according to Anurag Agrawal, an evolutionary ecologist and the James A. Perkins Professor of Environmental Studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. But he added that he does not find the idea of reverse evolution in the tomatoes to be particularly surprising.“Most evolutionary biologists would reject evolution as a forward process, it is more of a tinkering process that frequently takes detours and reversions,” Agrawal said in an email.He pointed to examples such as eye loss in cave dwelling animals, flightlessness in birds that evolved from flying ancestors — such as penguins, ostriches and kiwi birds — and the loss of hind limbs in aquatic mammals such as whales, dolphins and porpoises, when their four-legged forebears returned to the sea.Further research, including experiments to figure out the timing and conditions under which the tomato plants evolved to this ancestral state, would help confirm what caused the reversion.Alkaloids in high concentrations aren’t safe for people to eat, which makes studying the compounds and how to control them valuable, Jozwiak said. But, as of now, the wild-growing tomatoes have no impact on human health, since they are not grown for human consumption.Jozwiak said he hopes to return to the islands to look for answers to these questions, as well as other traits potentially influenced by the ancestral molecules, such as the plants’ interactions with insects and the rate at which they decompose.Nevertheless, the term “reverse evolution” can be seen as controversial in the evolutionary biology world, as evolution is usually not thought to go backward, Jozwiak said.Furthermore, “since evolution has no predetermined goal, it’s a bit problematic to talk about ‘forward’ and ‘reverse.’ Change is change,” said Eric Haag, a professor of biology at the University of Maryland in College Park, in an email. Haag was not involved with the study.Haag referred to the rule in evolutionary biology known as Dollo’s Law, which states that once a trait has been lost in evolution, it will not be regained the exact same way. For example, dolphins once evolved to be land mammals, then returned to the sea millions of years ago, but their tails were positioned differently, and they still had to breathe air, Haag explained.Because of this, the paper “represents somewhat of a challenge to Dollo’s Law,” he added. “It appears the specific amino acid changes… in the Galápagos species are some of the same ones found in much more distant ancestors. Converging down to that level is interesting, for sure.”But it is complicated, Haag noted, because it also appears that the tomatoes have some differences from their ancestral counterparts — the tomatoes on the younger islands that regained the ancestral gene produced both the modern alkaloids and the ancient ones. More study is needed to understand what is really going on, and whether natural selection favored the ancestral mutations, he said.While Jozwiak does not study humans, he said that by viewing evolution as more flexible, scientists could observe other species in which this may be happening — and could also explore the possibility of humans one day “reverse evolving,” or reinstating ancestral genes over time.However, the term reverse evolution is “non-sensical because it implies that we have reverted to an ancestral state, which obviously, is impossible,” Hall told CNN in an email. He equated it more to a “retention of evolutionary potential.” This is also seen in horses that have one toe, but occasionally can be born with three, like their ancestors, he noted.“What is lost in modern horses is three toes. What is retained from ancestors is the potential to form three digits,” Hall added.On the other hand, Beth Shapiro, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at University of California, Santa Cruz, said she finds the term to be a great way to engage more people in the concept of evolution.“It’s simply a human-centric rather than purely scientific way of talking about it. Evolution isn’t directional; it’s random,” Shapiro said in an email. “As time moves on evolution continues — and sometimes that means gene variants that aren’t common anymore become common once again. But it’s just evolution.”While the concept that evolution “can go in any direction” is not readily accepted by some scientists, Jozwiak said it is still an important topic worth further study.“Evolution was always kind of forced by environmental conditions, by competition,” he added. “It would be nice to show that the traits that species had in the past were perfect for that situation in the past, and if these conditions change now, we can go back to that trait that we had, or other species had.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Thomson and Myers explain that this isn’t the first time they’ve left the US to start a new life in a different country. They’ve done it twice before.“I don’t know that I want to live and die in the country that I was born in,” explains Thomson, before stressing that they certainly aren’t “anti US,” but were keen to avoid living a “vanilla life.”But Thomson and Myers returned to the US after two years due to challenges with “security” and “infrastructure.”The couple say that they found it difficult to run their business from Mexico due to constant internet connection issues.After losing her job, she convinced her husband to move to Mexico and open up a B&B. Here’s what happened nextWhile they were disappointed that things didn’t work out in Mexico, the couple hadn’t given up on the idea of settling somewhere new. And nearly a decade later, they got itchy feet again.Determined to make a success of this move, they got an apartment in Quito and invested time and money into making it comfortable.“We are introverts,” explains Thomson. “We’re not shy, but we like our quiet and our peace. And Latin American cultures are noisy.“The pace of life is very different than what we are accustomed to. And it just didn’t feel like a good mesh for our values.”After a nationwide state of emergency was called in Ecuador last year as an “internal armed conflict” broke out, Thomson decided enough was enough.“I just looked at (Jeremy) one day and said, ‘This is never going to end. There’s always going to be a strike, there’s always going to be a power outage…“We need to go somewhere that’s not in constant crisis,’” she recalls, conceding that she didn’t feel safe there. The US State Department currently advises US citizens to “exercise increased caution in Ecuador due to risk of crime, terrorism, unrest, and kidnapping.”Thomson admits it took a while to convince Myers that they should pack up and leave yet another country.“The cost of living in Ecuador was quite affordable, but getting there was not cheap,” explains Thomson, adding that they ended up giving away most of their stuff in Ecuador to charity before they left.“You have to stay in a place for a certain number of years to recoup the expense of the exploratory trip.”Once they were both on the same page, Thomson and Myers remained in Ecuador while they tried to figure out their next move.Determined to find the right destination for them, the couple created an “oh so detailed” spreadsheet listing all of the places they could potentially move to, with France and Slovenia high on the list.Thomson and Myers explain that they wanted to live somewhere with good hiking opportunities, as they “like being outside,” as well as a strong international community and manageable weather.“We don’t like it too hot or too cold, I’ve a very narrow window,” says Thomson, explaining that the spreadsheet was useful as it “quantified everything” and “took a lot of the emotion out.”After whittling their list down to a few top contenders, they eventually decided on Bulgaria, mainly because it met their requirements and regulations would allow them to continue running their business while on a retirement visa.“It was pretty close between Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania…” says Thomson, adding that all three countries had “beautiful hiking,” natural landscapes, an affordable cost of living and similar weather.Once they’d made their decision, the couple went back to the US to apply for a Bulgarian D visa, a long-stay visa for non-EU citizens that is required to apply for a Bulgarian residence permit, opting not to take an exploratory trip to Bulgaria beforehand.They initially stayed in Sofia, before moving to the ancient city of Plovdiv, known as the “City of the Seven Hills,” in southern Bulgaria, four weeks later.“We did not choose Sofia as a permanent home, because it’s a city and (Jeremy) rides a bike,” explains Maureen, adding that it was perhaps “too big a city” for them.While they’re still finding their feet, Thomson and Myers feel that Bulgaria suits them immensely and they love the “relaxed” way of life there.Myers says he’s found that Bulgarians have a better work/life balance and are more focused on family.As for cultural differences, the couple explain that while Bulgarians can come across as “brusque,” locals have been hugely welcoming.“Of course, they have their own political problems,” says Myers. “But we don’t know what the heck those things are about. So we’re just kind of disconnected from that.”Although they admit to struggling to learn the language, the couple are determined to master it, and have found that locals are “so appreciative” when they make an attempt at speaking Bulgarian as “they know how hard” it is to learn.Safety has been a major factor for Thomson, and she says she can walk alone at night in Bulgaria without any worries — something she didn’t feel comfortable doing in Ecuador.“I do not worry about mass shootings,” she says, admitting that she used to “scope out the exits” whenever she walked into a new place in the US.“If I hear a loud bang, I assume it’s a car backfiring, as opposed to hitting the ground like I would in the US… That’s the big thing for me, I just feel like I can breathe.”While the couple admit to missing the “efficiency” in the US, where things tend to get done “when you want something,” this is a sacrifice they’re willing to make.They’ve made some friends in Plovdiv, but point out that the international community isn’t as “active” as they’d anticipated.Although they love their apartment and have settled into the community well, the city is “hotter than hell” in the summertime, says Thomson.Thomson says that she finds it to be similar to Breckenridge, a skiing town in Colorado, while still “retaining the charm of a Bulgarian village.”“We are very excited,” Thomson adds, explaining that there’s “hiking all over the place” and the city is becoming a bit of a digital nomad hub.“I fit in well with the digital nomads, because I still work, and I guess I technically am one,” says Thomson.While finding the perfect place has been far from straightforward, Thomson feels that Bulgaria is the right fit for them, and stresses that they have “no desire to move again.”Thomson and Myers have since launched a YouTube channel, Expat Journey, detailing their experiences moving from one country to another.“We are very fortunate in that we have our health,” says Thomson. “But it would have to be some sort of an extenuating circumstance – a health crisis, or a political crisis.”Reflecting on their previous relocation attempts, Thomson jokes that “sometimes the second or third time’s the charm.”“We were saying, ‘When are we going to get this right?” she recalls. “But now that we’re in Bulgaria, it feels like we’re on the cusp of getting it right.”Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter.

Ten days had passed since the “ceasefire” was announced and I thought it must finally be safe for me to go out. Venturing out was supposed to be a step towards reclaiming a small part of my old life.My brother and I were almost at the cafe when we heard a very familiar sound – the thunder of an explosion. An Israeli drone had hit the entrance of Twix Cafe.Three people were killed and several others were injured. Had my brother and I left my family’s tent a few minutes earlier, we, too, may have been among the casualties.As the news spread, my family went into panic, calling us over and over again. The signal was weak, and their attempts to reach us were failing. We were able to comfort our mum only when we got back to the tent.When the ceasefire agreement came into effect and we were told by foreign leaders that the war was over, many of us dared to hope. We thought the explosions would finally stop, that we could begin to rebuild our shattered lives without fear.But there is no such hope under Israeli occupation. The violence never truly ends. That day, when the Israeli army bombed Twix Cafe, it also bombed dozens of other places throughout the Gaza Strip, killing at least 45 people and injuring many more.On Sunday, panic and insecurity spread throughout the Strip as the mass bombardment started. As explosions were going off, people rushed to the markets to secure as much food as they could afford to prepare for the war and starvation resuming.It was heartbreaking to see how, amid the bombs, people’s minds automatically focused on food. It seems we have lost forever the feeling of security, of knowing that tomorrow we will have food on the table.Yesterday, the WFP spokesperson said no large aid convoys have entered Gaza City; Israel still does not give the agency the permission to use Salah al-Din Street. The Israeli policy of starving Gaza’s north is still in effect.The Rafah border crossing with Egypt – our only outlet to the rest of the world – remains closed. We don’t know when it will open again; when the thousands of injured people will be allowed to cross for urgent medical treatment; when students will be able to leave to continue their education; when families, torn apart by the war, will be reunited; when those who love Gaza – those who have waited so long to come home – will finally be able to return.It is by now clear that Israel is treating this “ceasefire” like a switch – turning it on and off as it pleases. On Sunday, we were back to massive bombardment, on Monday, it was “ceasefire” again. As if nothing had happened, as though 45 people hadn’t been massacred, as if no homes had been destroyed and no families shattered. It is devastating to see our lives treated as if they do not matter. It is soul-crushing to know that Israel can resume mass murder whenever it wants, without warning, without an excuse.This ceasefire is nothing more than a pause in what we now believe is an endless war – a moment of silence that can end at any moment. We will remain at the mercy of a murderous occupier until the world finally recognises our right to live and takes real action to secure it. Until then, we will remain numbers in headlines about Israel’s endless killing spree.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.","headline":"We survived the war, we may not survive the ceasefire","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/25/we-survived-the-war-we-may-not-survive-the-ceasefire","message":"Last Sunday, I stepped out of my family’s tent in az-Zawayda, in the central Gaza Strip and headed to the nearby Twix Cafe, a coworking space for freelancers and students.

Rather than relying on external mediation, this is the first peacebuilding effort conducted entirely through a nation’s democratic institutions, with the parliament leading the initiative.In Spain’s case, the peace process with ETA was overseen by the International Contact Group and prominent figures such as Kofi Annan, supported by Norway, Switzerland, and France, and concluded within six years. Similarly, Colombia’s peace accord with FARC, reached in four years, was facilitated by Norway and Cuba as guarantor states.As Professor Ira William Zartman noted in his “ripeness theory,” peacemaking becomes possible at the “ripe moment”. Turkiye’s rapid progress is remarkable; yet the real test lies in how comprehensively the settlement is implemented.Turkiye’s geographic position at the intersection of Europe, Asia and the Middle East makes its stability crucial for global energy security. Turkiye today stands at the centre of a broader geopolitical arc stretching from the Eastern Mediterranean through the Middle East to the Caucasus and the Black Sea, serving as a unique bridge of connectivity and power. The region surrounding Turkiye contains about 65 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its natural gas reserves.Beyond efficiency, stability along these routes enhances investor confidence, strengthens Europe’s diversification strategy, and consolidates Turkiye’s role as a reliable energy and transportation hub uniting East and West. Consequently, a stable and terror-free Turkiye is pivotal not only for the regional economy but also for the global order.The European Union welcomed the PKK’s dissolution as a significant opportunity, expressing its readiness to support the peace process. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, called it “one of the rare pieces of good news from the region,” while the European Parliament’s rapporteur on Turkiye, Nacho Sanchez Amor, described the peace call as a “historic step”.The disbandment of the PKK – recognised as a terrorist organisation by both the EU and the United States – along with its proxies in Syria, namely the YPG and SDF, is expected to strengthen Turkiye’s democracy, help meet EU expectations, and accelerate the country’s accession process. For NATO, of which Turkiye is a longstanding southeastern anchor, acting in the spirit of alliance and upholding the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is essential. The broader international community should support this initiative and refrain from backing proxy structures that undermine it.Another destabilising factor is Israel. Its continued support for the YPG/SDF jeopardises the dissolution process and fuels armed separatism along Turkiye’s borders. Beyond that, the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has shaken regional stability, while Israel has intensified its military actions in Syria and Lebanon, carried out operations in Iran, and launched strikes on targets in Tunisia, Yemen and even Qatar during ceasefire talks. These actions breach international law and threaten the fragile balance that is only now being restored. Israel’s continued aggression thus represents a major threat to the security of both the political and energy order.Decades of chronic fear, pain and division could now give way to solidarity and prosperity. The road ahead will not be free of challenges, yet political unity, social cohesion, and international cooperation can turn this moment into a truly historic opportunity. A terror-free Turkiye safeguards vital energy and trade routes while offering a vision of regional confidence and shared progress.This transformation carries profound implications for the region stretching from Europe to the Caucasus and the Middle East. By removing the threat of terror, disruption, and new waves of migration, Turkiye strengthens the reliability of the critical supply corridors on which Europe depends, attracts greater international investment in energy and logistics projects, and creates the conditions for its neighbours to build on stability rather than conflict. If pursued with determination, this path will pave the way for a future defined by a sustainable security architecture and lasting peace grounded in mutual benefit.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.","headline":"Terror-free Turkiye: A homegrown peace reshaping the region","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/24/terror-free-turkiye-a-homegrown-peace-reshaping-the-region","message":"The PKK’s dissolution marks a uniquely Turkish path to peace, strengthening energy security and regional cooperation.

Inside is the pitch black, deserted church and the team start to set up their specialist gear.Infrared and thermal cameras are carefully positioned, and audio detectors are set to bat friendly frequencies.The bats soon begin to emerge, darting and swooping up and down the aisles, the amplified sounds of their bat chatter filling the historic building.A new study published in the British Ecological Society's journal People & Nature has found that these historic buildings are providing vital homes for the nocturnal animals.\"Full of little nooks and crannies where they can roost, big open flight spaces, dry spaces inside, away from the rain, where they can fly around. It is really just an absolutely perfect environment.\"There are two types of bats at Guestwick: Common Pipistrelles and Natterer's. They roost high up in the rafters.The Pipistrelles emerge first, flying around for a few minutes, before squeezing out through minute gaps around the church door.The Natterer's come out a little later, preferring to exit through small holes in the roof to get outside and find food.Without the help of the specialist cameras, the bats are near impossible to spot, lost in the darkness.\"They're lovely, but they're problematic too,\" says Graeme Peart from St Margaret's Church, Saxlingham, just a few miles from Guestwick.\"There's the urine, the droppings,\" he says. \"One time there was a carpet leading up to the altar that became absolutely sodden with urine and droppings and had to be thrown away. They also destroyed the brass work.\"But the church has worked with the Bats in Churches team to find a solution - they've built a sealed-off loft conversion above the vestry.\"The idea is that the bats that are in the main body of the church will live in here, rather than in the church itself,\" he explains.\"What we have found is certain weeks during the year there'll be a hundred bats in here, and then suddenly they will disappear,\" says Parker.Diana Spencer says there are other less costly solutions and grants are on offer from the Bat Conservation Trust.\"On a simple level, you can use sheets or covers over areas where things might be damaged. You can put wax coating on things like brass so that the urine doesn't damage it.\"She recommends that anyone who finds bats in a building should contact the National Bat Helpline for advice.\"They're losing lots of habitat - lots of woodland,\" says Spencer. \"And we're also knocking down old buildings, making our homes warmer, more airtight - there are less places for them to go.\"Church users are having to learn to live alongside these creatures of the night - and some parishes are even starting to see bats as more of a treat than a trick.\"And they can be a really, really good way of reaching people, particularly in the local community, who might not come into a church for a service or prayer, but they'll come in to watch the bats, because people find them really, really fascinating.\"","headline":"Bats are seeking sanctuary in UK churches - but they're making an unholy mess","level":"bbc","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8vq5318dxo","message":"As night falls, the bat hunters make their way amongst the gravestones of Guestwick Church in Norfolk.

Everything is gone – dressers, stove – everything is gone,” Samms said, sitting beside other residents next to shopping carts loaded with their remaining belongings.It was “a nice, quiet, very docile town,” said a man from a nearby town after surveying the devastation. Now it’s a “hell on Earth,” he said.The town’s narrow roads are now cluttered with metal roof panels, slabs of concrete, and all kinds of trash that the water brought in.Agonizing screams often echo through the town as residents walk around in circles, searching for loved ones or taking stock of the damage.The heat and humidity are adding another layer of complexity to the recovery efforts. There is a makeshift camp of people who rode out the storm, but nothing remains standing.Mayor Richard Solomon described the conditions as devastating. “Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing here,” he said.Adding to the devastation, Solomon said the storm “wiped out” the town’s relief supplies and rendered emergency vehicles inoperable due to water damage. This delayed the authorities’ ability to deliver much-needed aid.Dozens of residents were seen clearing out the shelves of a damaged supermarket out of desperation, taking basic needs such as food and water.“There’s no looting,” a resident said to CNN. “This is trying to survive. It’s a survival thing right now.” He said the police were also at the scene – not to deter them but to help.Getting aid from the outside has been a challenge as many roads remain blocked by debris, downed trees and floodwaters.Emergency crews and defense forces are gradually arriving to help where they can.

I have fond memories of the woods in Sussex, where I grew up, filling with primroses early in the year and carpeted with bluebells in the spring.I always used their nicknames - \"eggs and bacon\" for birds-foot-trefoil (a native plant known for its yellow slipper-like petals) and \"bread-and-cheese\" for the young shoots of the British tree hawthorn, which my friends and I would eat. And pretend to like!We picked rosehips from hedges too, which we split open to make itching powder, perfect for playground pranks.But later in life, on my walks through the countryside, I began to notice dwindling numbers of wildflowers. I missed the grasslands, bursting with colour, that I'd so enjoyed in my childhood.\"It's definitely a story of severe overall decline, both in the cover of flowers but also the diversity,\" explains Simon Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University.So, what will happen if there isn't more intervention to save wildflowers? What will the future look like?\"Awful, in a word,\" says Prof Potts. \"If we, let's say, take a scenario where we just continue business as usual as we are now, we will still keep losing our wildflowers.\"And with that, we lose the beneficial biodiversity like the pollinators and the natural enemies of pests.\"As a bee lover I am on team pollinator - which is one of the reasons why my husband and I decided to plant our own wildflower meadow. Not just for the beautiful colours but for the vibrancy of the bees, butterflies and moths flying around, which need that habitat.Yet since then, I've come to understand that the loss of wildflowers could bring - and the other perhaps more unexpected consequences too.\"The consequence will be for farmers,\" argues Prof Potts. \"They will get low yields and poor quality crops, consumers will have to pay higher prices. Our environment will be degraded, eroded, will have less wildlife.\"Many of them [wildflowers] produce nectar and pollen, which is super important for things like wild bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, that can pollinate crops.\"Prof Daniel Gibbs, food security lead at the University of Birmingham's School of Biosciences, also has concerns about the long-term consequences.\"Over time, and alongside pressures from climate change and land degradation, this could make our food system more fragile, and negatively impact food security,\" he says - meaning we could, for example, find ourselves with more limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.There are also studies showing that fields near wildflower-rich margins or meadows produce better-quality fruit and higher yields.\"Wildflowers can also support some bugs, like spiders and carabid beetles… [which] do an absolutely fantastic job in controlling some of the pests that we get on crops - that can either damage the crop or sometimes lower the quality of the produce,\" adds Prof Potts.He describes wildflowers as almost like little factories, pumping out beneficial bits of biodiversity that can help with food production.\"Farmers may have to rely more on manual pollination,\" Prof Gibbs says. \"Or we may need to look to increasing food imports, both of which can drive up prices.\"Multiple factors are behind the decline. Sarah Shuttleworth, a botanist with Plantlife, argues that certain intensive farming methods have contributed.But some intensive farming methods have also allowed farmers to grow food for the country - and farmers I spoke to pointed out that they face tough financial choices.Though there have been government subsidies in place for years, meaning farmers are paid by the government to support wildlife on their land, since Brexit the way these grants are paid has changed, with different schemes designed in each of the devolved nations.In England, there has been frustration in some quarters about the speed and rollout of the grants and the fact that some schemes have been paused - such as the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), though this is due to reopen, while others extended at the last minute, leaving farmers less able to plan ahead.Speaking about the SFI scheme, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson told the BBC: \"We inherited farming schemes which were untargeted and underspent, meaning millions of pounds were not going to farming businesses.\"We have changed direction to ensure public money is spent effectively, and last year all the government's farming budget was spent.\"They also acknowledged that wildflowers are vital, providing food and habitats for pollinators and wildlife, as well as improving biodiversity, and added: \"We are backing farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history and under our agri-environment schemes we are funding millions of hectares of wildflower meadows.\"\"I'd love [to] be profitable enough [to] say 'Look, we'll leave 5% of our farmland,'… but agricultural costs have gone up a lot,\" he says.Other farmers share similar tales. David Lord is a third-generation farmer in Essex and member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network.Knowing what funding for nature recovery on farms will be in place in future years is, he says, crucial. \"It takes time and care and cost to maintain [wildflowers]... A lot of farmers aren't going to be minded to just keep these habitats in place without the funding.\"Prof Potts says there has at least been a slowdown in decline over the last couple of decades - and perhaps a limited recovery for some species.\"I think [this] reflects some of the agricultural practices that have been a bit more nature-friendly.\"Nature writer, and author of Flora Britannica, Richard Mabey, agrees that the decline in wildflowers is far from universal.Certain species such as cow parsley, yarrow and knapweed are in fact spreading, and he welcomes an influx of non-native plants and \"garden escapes\", such as snowdrop and buddleia.Even so, Prof Potts says: \"It is the most precious things that we're losing the most of.\" This includes cornflowers, corncockle and corn marigold - what he terms the iconic British countryside flowers.And the overall decline is why my husband and I decided to create our own wildflower meadow from an overgrown arable field.There was a field next to our house, which I had put beehives in, with permission from the owner. I had often thought it would be wonderful to create a wildflower meadow around those hives, so when the opportunity arose to buy the field, we decided to go ahead.A conservation specialist advised us on where to buy the seed. It was particularly important to get some yellow rattle seed, which helps keep more dominant grasses in check. This in turn gives other wildflowers more opportunity to gain a foothold.Our first year after sowing was amazing. A patriotic bloom of red, white and blue burst across the field. The red was from poppies which came from the disturbed ground. The white was ox-eye daisies, bladder campion and wild carrot, with spires of bright blue from viper's bugloss.The colour has changed over time - the splash of red did not return, but different wildflowers arrived in their place.In fairness, I should admit it's years of my husband Chris's work. He found an old-fashioned seed fiddle for us to use — a hand-held device used to scatter the seeds in a controlled way, operated as though drawing a bow across a violin.He also cut the hay at the end of summer, initially trying with a scythe - Poldark-style - but ultimately finding a small tractor does the trick in a less backbreaking way.Of course, many people are not in the fortunate position we found ourselves in, of being able to create a wildflower meadow. And in the UK, you cannot plant wildflowers just anywhere — you would most likely need the landowner's permission.But growing numbers of people are trying to create their own patches of wildflowers. Plantlife reports that more and more are joining its No Mow May initiative —  an annual campaign to let wildflowers grow freely, by packing away the lawnmower.Sarah Shuttleworth says just a small spot can make a difference, especially when it comes to pollinators. \"Anyone who has a patch of grass could do their bit… the idea is that you're recreating a meadow-type management scheme, but in a very, very micro scale.\"The charity would like to see wildflower habitats being given the same kind of protection as other precious landscapes. Meanwhile Prof Potts thinks, \"We need a bit more of a radical think about how to support farmers to do the right thing.\"\"We have seen hares here now, which we never had a year or two ago, before we started doing this. So it's really exciting...\"Mr Taylor says the soil was poor there anyway. \"You have to have nature to be able to grow food,\" he adds. \"Because you need the pollinators as you need the ecosystem, the food chains, the soil webs and everything else to be able to grow food sustainably in the long-term - so I like to think of it as a reservoir of biodiversity.\"\"Those species are just valuable in their own right, regardless of what they do or what they provide… They've also got their own right to be,\" argues Dr Kelly Hemmings, associate professor in ecology at the Royal Agricultural University.Richard Mabey stresses a similar point. \"They are important, in my view, for ethical reasons, simply because they exist.\"Beyond that they are the infrastructure of all other life on the Earth, the fundamental base of the food chain.\"BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

RSF members have frequently recorded themselves committing atrocities in the past.Sudanese medical and rights groups, including the Sudan Doctors Network, said the RSF was committing mass killings, detaining people and attacking hospitals.The UN Human Rights Office said the RSF’s actions included summary executions of people fleeing, and that there were “indications of ethnic motivations for killings”.An analysis by Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) appeared to confirm reports of mass killings, using satellite imagery and remote-sensing data.HRL concluded that clusters of objects and ground discolouration are evidence of human bodies and pools of blood. The clusters and discolouration were not present in images taken before the RSF invaded, the report noted.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Monday that five Sudanese volunteers with the organisation had been killed in Bara and that three more were missing.Bara is just outside el-Obeid, a strategic city currently under SAF control, but which the RSF is advancing to take.The RSF is already deeply embedded across the west of the country and wants to completely dominate the area, while the SAF is attempting to push into RSF territory from its strongholds in the east.El-Fasher is the capital of North Darfur and, until Sunday, was the last major city that had not fallen to the RSF in Darfur. With its seizure this week, the country is now effectively partitioned between a SAF-controlled east and an RSF-controlled west.The RSF has declared a parallel government across Darfur, while the Sudanese army is in eastern, central and northern strongholds.El-Obeid is the oil-rich capital of North Kordofan state, in the Kordofan region neighbouring Darfur and is a strategic link between Darfur and Khartoum.El-Obeid is currently controlled by SAF, but the RSF is attempting to close in, which would mean losing SAF’s crucial buffer between its Khartoum base and RSF territory, analysts say.On Monday, SAF commander and de facto leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced that his troops had withdrawn from el-Fasher to spare the population “the systemic destruction and the systemic killing of civilians” by the RSF.On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Hussein Al-Amin blamed the international community for failing to take action against the RSF.The RSF maintains that it seeks to “unify Sudan” under a “true democracy”, its leader, Mohammed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, said on Wednesday, adding that any individuals found to have committed crimes against civilians would be held accountable.The main dispute is who will lead the country, with SAF demanding that the RSF integrate fully into its ranks and command structure.In January, the US Department of State declared that the RSF and its allied armed groups were committing genocide in Darfur.Sudanese rights groups have warned that an RSF takeover of el-Fasher would be catastrophic for civilians, particularly those from sedentary, “non-Arab” tribes.Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, reporting from Khartoum, said people who fled el-Fasher told of the RSF going door to door and executing people based on ethnicity.The RSF reportedly detained hundreds of others, and there are many reports of sexual violence against women.The seizure of el-Fasher gives the RSF control of the entire Darfur region, a vast region strategically located along the Chad, Libya and South Sudan borders and a significant source of Sudan’s gold.Several rounds of peace talks led by Saudi Arabia, the United States, and the African Union have failed to have any major impact.Their timeline proposed a humanitarian truce for three months to allow aid in, eventually leading to a permanent ceasefire. It also called for a transition to civilian control within nine months.Last week, representatives of SAF and RSF reportedly held indirect negotiations in Washington, DC, with further talks scheduled at the end of October.","headline":"Massacre in el-Fasher: What’s happening in Sudan right now?","level":"aljazeera","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/massacre-in-el-fasher-whats-happening-in-sudan-right-now","message":"Rights groups say the RSF paramilitary group committed mass atrocities as it seized the besieged city in North Darfur.

It also said anyone else without an urgent reason to go out should work from home.Tanzania’s main opposition party CHADEMA had called for protests during the election, which also included votes for members of parliament and officials for the semi-autonomous Zanzibar archipelago.CHADEMA was disqualified in April after it refused to sign a code of conduct, and its leader Tundu Lissu was charged with treason.The commission also disqualified the candidate for opposition party ACT-Wazalendo, leaving only minor parties to take on Hassan.","headline":"More protests in Dar es Salaam after chaotic Tanzanian election","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/africa/tanzania-election-protests-dar-es-salaam-latam-intl","message":"Police in Tanzania fired tear gas and gunshots on Thursday to disperse groups of protesters who returned to the streets a day after a general election marred by violent demonstrations, witnesses said.

He called the deaths “deeply disturbing” and urged police to exercise restraint.“The Tanzanian authorities must promptly conduct a thorough and independent investigation into the unlawful use of lethal force against protesters, and the perpetrators must be held accountable,” Chagutah added.Internet access remained down across the city, where hundreds had set polling stations alight and chanted their discontent on election day.“We have been silent for so long,” one protester shouted in a video posted to TikTok and verified by Al Jazeera. “What have we been doing?”Wednesday’s election saw President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s two biggest challengers excluded from the race, infuriating citizens and rights groups who have also decried an intensifying crackdown against opposition members, activists and journalists.Despite the internet blackout, protesters continued to organise on the Zello app, discussing possible marches on government buildings.

But humanitarian workers who’ve spoken to survivors fleeing the city related stories of summary executions and rapes, streets strewn with bodies and men and boys being prevented from leaving.Multiple videos shared online over the past three days show RSF fighters rounding up and killing large numbers of unarmed people. CNN was able to match the insignia worn by the fighters in several of the videos to the one used by the RSF.One video shows an unarmed man in civilian clothes on the ground, pleading for his life before a man addressed as commander.The fighter is seen shooting him multiple times. Dozens more bodies are clearly visible in the video.Another video shows at least eight men dressed in civilian clothes sitting on the ground next to each other before being killed in a quick succession.Several videos show executions and RSF fighters celebrating next to bodies by a berm, a raised bank of earth that was built around El Fasher during the siege to trap people inside the city.Other videos show armed RSF fighters driving through large swaths of land, apparently hunting civilians who are attempting to flee. In one video, the rebels are heard saying “catch the girls.”Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported by human rights groups as a major problem in Sudan and multiple humanitarian workers have told CNN that women and girls who have managed to escape El Fasher in recent days were victims of sexual violence and rape.CNN has geolocated several of the videos showing jubilant RSF forces inside El Fasher. Satellite images analyzed by the Humanitarian Research Lab at Yale School of Public Health and verified by CNN show clear evidence of the atrocities in El Fasher.Groups of bodies appear to be visible in satellite images of areas where RSF killings have been reported in recent days.The Yale researchers also say they have identified reddish patches on the ground consistent with blood in several locations, including outside the Saudi Hospital and near the berm around the city.The bodies and the reddish stains are only visible in the satellite images taken on Monday and Tuesday, after the RSF takeover.“The Rapid Support Forces have surrounded this city in an earth wall called a berm that’s as high as nine feet,” said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Research Lab.“So the context here is these people are inside what we call a Kill Box. They have been walled in to be killed systematically, and right now the Rapid Support Forces are doing that,” he said.Adam Rojal, the spokesperson for the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur, told CNN he left the besieged city two weeks ago. He said that civilians are currently not allowed to leave and that the situation is “appalling.”“(People who fled) tell horrific stories about the suffering and abuses they have subjected to. The property of citizens has been confiscated, there are floggings, and attacks. I have seen the execution videos,” he said.A report from Yale Humanitarian Research Lab shows satellite images revealing mounting evidence of possible war crimes in Sudan as the RSF takes control of El Fasher in the Darfur region. CNN’s Nada Bashir reports.Manal bint Abi Suleiman, who fled El Fasher after the RSF takeover, said the attack on the area where she was sheltering started on Saturday. “The Rapid Support Forces entered and destroyed everything in front of them,” she said in a video testimony filmed by a volunteer helping refugees.“On the way, they harassed the people and beat some of them. They separated the young men from the women, and I don’t know where they took the men. God knows where they are now,” she said.In videos shared online, several other survivors have also referenced killings of both men and women and bodies lying in the streets.Save the Children’s deputy country director for Sudan, Francesco Lanino, told CNN that survivors who reached a refugee camp in Tawila in southern Darfur described the extreme danger they faced as they fled.“All the areas surrounding El Fasher are controlled by different militias, or different armed groups that are related to RSF or somehow part of RSF,” Lanino said.“It’s not only RSF who are looking for civilians, looking for people to (rob), to abuse or kill,” he added.The RSF has been supported by Arab groups and militias from across the Sahel region as well as the Russian paramilitary group Wagner.The UN’s humanitarian team in Sudan said on Tuesday it has received “credible reports of widespread violations, including summary executions, attacks on civilians along escape routes, house-to-house raids and obstacles preventing civilians from reaching safety,” adding that “sexual violence, particularly against women and girls, continues to be reported.”Arjan Hehenkamp, the Darfur crisis lead for the International Rescue Committee, told CNN that many of the people fleeing El Fasher are in a “deplorable state.”“Many of them are sick and wounded… there’s many women, many elderly, but a big gap in terms of young men and adult men,” he said.“The big concern that we have right now is, where is the rest of the population of El Fasher? We haven’t seen the big numbers that we were expecting so far. So that is very disturbing,” he added.“The majority of these people coming from El Fasher are women and children. And according to their stories, the men are kidnapped or were killed on the way coming to Tawila because of their ethnic group, because they were men, and they were somehow stopped and targeted,” he said.Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s lead in Sudan, told CNN that violence has soared in the days following the RSF’s takeover.He said he’d spoken to women who fled El Fasher who said their male relatives were all either killed or detained by RSF.Speaking to CNN from the eastern city of Port Sudan after returning from an area near Darfur where people are seeking safety, Yett said the stories shared by survivors were “blood-curdling.” There were groups of women arriving alone, saying their male relatives have been killed or detained, he added.“(Fighters are) going house to house, raids, people being dragged out, just the most horrific stories. People are being held (to) ransom. They’re being told, basically, you pay or you die, call your relatives, get the money together,” he said.The group has appealed to international organizations, including WHO, to intervene and “exert maximum pressure on RSF to release” the abductees.As more reports of alleged atrocities pour in, multiple international organizations, world leaders and human rights groups have called for an immediate ceasefire and quick independent investigations into the killings.Yett said that the fact that the fighters are filming themselves killing civilians and posting these videos online shows “a feeling of lack of accountability.”“We need to ensure there’s clear accountabilities here. I mean all violations of international law need to be investigated. We need to hold people accountable,” he said.","headline":"Rebels accused of massacring hundreds of people as videos emerge of atrocities and bodies in Sudanese city","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/sudan-massacres-rsf-rebels-darfur","message":"An elderly man sits on the floor, dozens of bodies lying around him, before a Sudanese rebel fighter approaches and shoots him.

But for bold renters there’s one sure way to get a discount: choose a property haunted by a murder or unnatural death.The houses, often apartments inside the city’s tall residential buildings, strike so much fear among residents that anyone willing to live there can negotiate hefty discounts in one of the world’s most expensive property markets.“The discount could be massive and many people who don’t mind can rent these places below the market price” said Ng Goon-lau, an investor so well-known for owning dozens of these apartments that local media has dubbed him the “King of Haunted Houses.”Lists of haunted houses can be found on most estate agent websites. They are places where an unnatural or premature death has occurred and include the scenes of some of the city’s most gruesome murders.Other real estate agencies offer advice about how to identify spooky apartments, including checking death certificates and quizzing potential neighbors about the apartment’s history.In a city heavily influenced by Buddhism and Taoism, living in apartments associated with ghastly deaths often stokes fear of bad fortune.Feng shui master Andrew Kwan said people believe that those who died a tragic death may not get closure. “Their hatred may stay. (Their spirit) may remain in the apartment,” he said.The fear of a curse has created a unique market for bargain-hunting investors and tenants who are happy to try their luck.“The belief in Feng Shui is quite strong among Chinese, and the population in Hong Kong is about 94% Chinese…implying that most buyers have a large distaste for haunted houses,” said Bhattacharya.Disclosure is not required under Hong Kong law, but regulators demand property agents provide accurate information about any death upon inquiry.These details matter because the circumstance of the death – from accidents to malicious murders – could determine the size of the discount.“Many people don’t actually have a strong feeling against hung zaats. It all comes down to the extent of the discount,” he said.Owners of the properties are almost certain to lose money. It’s very difficult to find a buyer for homes listed as a haunted house – partly because banks also tend to stay away.Eric Pau, Senior Associate Director at Ricacorp Properties, a major real estate firm in Hong Kong, told CNN many banks view them as high-risk investments. “In most cases, mortgages will not be granted,” he said.But he said others see it as an opportunity. As an investor, Ng’s playbook is to be selective about the type of “haunted homes” he buys.He tries to avoid properties associated with gruesome murders as much as possible and looks for places where the death occurred some time ago.“Fortunately, some ‘haunted houses’ have been around for so long that people have forgotten about what happened,” he said. “The main thing is to make people not to feel sad and unpleasant.”One time, he said, a tenant broke the lease just days after moving in. The tenant never told him why, so he turned to the neighbors.“The neighbors told me that the three-year-old son of this tenant opened a very difficult book in the middle of the night and read it attentively,” Ng recalled being told.","headline":"This city has some of the world’s most expensive rents.

Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.Decades before Salem, hysteria over witchcraft was already sweeping through England – and perhaps nowhere more fervently than in the southeast, such as in the neighboring counties of Kent and Essex, which border London.The accused were held in a small, dark jail that once stood on the ground floor of the courthouse, now tucked away in the attic of the rebuilt Town Hall.The trial’s notoriety was such that a special pamphlet was published shortly after, titled “A Prodigious and Tragic History of the Arraignment, Trial, Confession, and Condemnation of Six Witches,” of which Maidstone Council has a rare replica.The document describes bizarre and unverified claims – including one woman swelling “into a monstrous and vast bigness” before the court and another allegedly bearing “a visible teat under her tongue.”Three women were convicted after failing a crude test: a pin thrust into their arms. The court account said the women “did not feel it, neither did it draw blood.”Two others confessed to being impregnated “not by any man, but by the devil,” according to the document.All six were convicted of “the execrable and diabolical crime of witchcraft” and sentenced to death.“They were dragged on hurdles – basically carts – to the heath,” Tony Harwood, a councillor for Maidstone Borough Council, told CNN. “Thousands came to watch. Public executions were entertainment, but also a tool of control.”“These were women of all ages,” Harwood continued. “Very vulnerable individuals who had no idea what was going on or why they had been put into this situation. You just have to understand the absolute terror of these events – and that is partly what’s behind it. The powers that be wanted to instil terror.”Harwood described the horror and spectacle of the scene. “Public executions – they were public participation events. Thousands of people would attend. There were crime waves around them: pickpocketing, thefts, lots of complaints. That’s why the execution spot at Penenden Heath was moved several times – because of the impact from the many thousands of sightseers who came to watch,” he said.“There would have been people who were just there for the show. There would have been people who were appalled by what was going on. There would have been people who were excited by it.”After the executions, the bodies were discarded without ceremony. “When roads were widened or housing built, human remains have often been found,” Harwood added.A small stone plaque on the edge of Penenden Heath that commemorates these women – alongside the plaques for the many other people executed at this site – is the only mark of the atrocities that took place.Though the frenzy surrounding witchcraft in England faded in the decades following the Maidstone trial, and all laws criminalizing witchcraft have long since been repealed, the convictions of those women – and hundreds like them – still stand.“We need to set the record straight. These were innocent, vulnerable individuals who were brutally judicially murdered – often for political or personal gain. That injustice will echo down the ages.”Kehily said that the trials were “a very early form of violence against women and girls. It still happens. They were scapegoats.”“By highlighting it, we remind people that this has happened – and we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” she added.“To address a wrong that has been made,” Kehily said, “is to try and get it right, to learn from history, and to bring it to the fore. This hasn’t gone away.”Maidstone’s campaign follows similar efforts elsewhere in the United Kingdom to confront historical injustices.Councillors in Maidstone hope that a similar approach can be taken to address the legacy of the Witchcraft Act.“This is about justice,” Harwood said. “We’ve seen the government take steps to right past wrongs. Now it’s time to do the same for the women who were judicially murdered under the guise of witchcraft.”A Home Office spokesperson told CNN the government would respond to the council’s letter “in due course.”","headline":"Salem’s witches were pardoned, but Britain’s weren’t.

But along the way, his journey has taken him from a small commune to becoming a guiding light in a sport which, he believes, still has plenty of opportunity to grow.Despite the hardship and trauma he’s dealt with over his life, Rensch says he doesn’t hold any resentment. He believes the struggles of his past are all part of life’s rich tapestry, highlighting a quote from influential Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as the motto he lives by: “We are not what happens to us, we are what we choose to become.”“I think we can learn through pain and suffering sadly, but also it can give us an appreciation for what we have,” Rensch told CNN Sports. “Part of my journey is that what grief has taught me is that your relationships are what matter the most and connecting with other people through whatever you’re doing is what actually gives you purpose.“Your purpose is not anything you do. It is what you feel and what you find within why you do it. And I adhere myself to the fact that I am not what has happened to me. I am what I’ve chosen to become. And I try to take that into everything that I do and everything that we do at Chess.com.”Growing up, Rensch recalls in his memoir that he was afforded the freedom to run around with children his own age, spending days in the woods with his friends or splashing around in the water.Run by Steven and Trina Kamp, the Collective would meet to ensure members focused on their spiritual alignment and, as a group, would pool their money together to ensure they were financially merged.Rensch recalls they would organize meetings – called Processes – where the members of the Collective would discuss whether or not a fellow member was following the teachings of Duran and, therefore, if they were spiritually pure. Rensch says in his memoir that these meetings often descended into loud arguments due to the amount of alcohol being consumed, and it would not be uncommon for someone to be “glassed” by having a full cup of liquid thrown in their face.Families would share accommodations, with Rensch recalling sharing beds with other kids across multiple abodes. But as a child, this was just something he was used to at the time.Many traveled to the Collective in search of meaning. But, as Rensch came to find out, life in an idealistic commune often doesn’t end in spiritual happiness.Despite preaching an equal society, it became apparent to Rensch that that wasn’t the case. He references a famous George Orwell quote from the classic novella Animal Farm when describing the hierarchy inside the Collective: “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.”“There were leaders and there was a literal hierarchy, a totem pole system. In some ways, the members self-ranked and sort of self-flagellated in order to keep everything in check,” Rensch explained to CNN.Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health professional and one of the leading experts on cults, told CNN Sports that these kinds of groups can cause a “dissociative disorder and a disruption of identity” in members.“So in my case, I went from Steven Hassan of Flushing Queens, youngest of three kids, nice Jewish boy, wasn’t political, to a right-wing fascist wanting to take over the world,” Hassan said.“And so I had a pseudo-identity in the image of the cult. So my own critical thinking was pushed down. It wasn’t erased, but it was pushed down. The public has this incorrect assumption that people who get into cults are weak or stupid or uneducated, and it’s just not true. In Danny’s case, he had no choice.”As a child, the social dynamics of the group didn’t register with Rensch. But in hindsight, he is now able to recognize the pitfalls of the group.Rensch says in his book that the Kamps were able to weaponize the faith the Collective preached in an attempt to alter people’s life courses for the gain of the individual and the group. Whether it be how they raised their children or the job they were doing, the Kamps could decide whether it was the right fit spiritually and, if not, take steps to adjust.Also, in the search of spiritual happiness, it was commonplace for families to undergo dramatic changes. Husbands would leave their wives in search of their “Like Vibration” – a better fitting partner in the eyes of the Collective – and Rensch says children would be separated from their parents and adopted into other families to allow the child to flourish.Rensch was an ordinary kid who liked ordinary activities. But his whole life changed upon watching the film “Searching for Bobby Fischer.”He was immediately gripped by a sport which was so different to any other, one which tested the brain in completely different ways than any other.And, as it turned out, Rensch was good at it from the outset. He would spend hours playing and teaching himself until his skills eventually caught the eye of church leader Steven Kamp.Kamp, a chess fan himself, saw the potential in Rensch’s game. Rensch said he later came to realize that Kamp saw Rensch’s ability at chess as a way of legitimizing the teachings of the Collective and justify the way the group worked.According to Rensch, Kamp took it upon himself to make sure that the boy received special chess training – including hiring the former Soviet defector, Igor Ivanov – and providing funds and transport so Rensch could travel to tournaments around Arizona and the country to test his skills. More than that, Kamp instructed Rensch that chess had become his Purpose, therefore instilling a religious importance to a game he was in his formative stages in learning.This added pressure on chess distorted his view on what was meant to be an enjoyable game, Rensch says.“When I was receiving discipline, to say it was wrapped up in shame and self-worth doesn’t even do it justice because the shame and self-worth was meant to transcend this lifetime. It was meant to transcend the planet,” he explained.“It was like: ‘Oh, I’m actually, literally going to hell if I’m not putting my efforts into getting as good as I can at chess all the time.’”This added attention and time to focus on chess meant Rensch quickly went from promising youngster to tournament winner and chess prodigy. Over his chess career, he would become the youngest national chess master in Arizona history and a multi-time national scholastic champion.But this success came with a catch: Kamp took it upon himself to push Rensch further and further into the chess world, no matter the consequences, Rensch says. He saw Rensch as a future grandmaster.The constant flights and elevation changes involved in the journeys he was making across the US resulted in Rensch developing tinnitus, he said, which would eventually develop into chronic pain, infections and sinus pressure.Rensch describes the most painful moment of his time with the group as being when he was separated from his mother, with his future success at chess given as a main reason why that move was orchestrated.Hassan said that children being separated from their parents is commonplace in cults, saying “parent alienation” is a typical practice.“This is something that typically happens with authoritarian cults. One of the parents gets into a cult, the other one doesn’t want to,” Hassan said. “So I’ve seen that one for 48 years. Every single cult does that as a thing.”Rensch’s chess playing career would eventually fizzle out, and looking back in hindsight, his relationship with the sport changed as he grew up and could recognize the environment he was living in.“The game gave me everything and then it took everything away. And I’ve been to hell and back with chess so many times,” he said.As Rensch went through his life in the Collective and his chess playing faded away, his issues continued to pile up.While he met his wife Shauna and had children of his own, Rensch says he dealt with alcohol and substance abuse as he struggled with the dynamic of the Collective and how he fit in. Shauna was briefly with the Collective when she was six but moved away before returning later in life.He recalls the moment he decided to leave the Collective shortly after the birth of his second child and coming to the painful realization that it was time to move on.That decoupling wasn’t an easy thought to process for Rensch, having spent most of his life with the group.“Whatever I could do to myself, whatever baggage I was willing to carry, as long as it was just me, there was probably a part of me that could or would do it forever,” he said. “And that’s part of how you dip in and out of addictive behavior and back out again, you dip in and out of almost ruining your marriage but then barely saving it.”Through years of development and clever marketing, Chess.com was able to develop into the dominant force of internet chess, with Rensch playing a key role behind that growth.‘Harder than losing in basketball:’ NBA legend Derrick Rose on his chess obsession and how it could save livesAs well as making it the main platform for coaches to help nurture the next generation of chess stars, a key manta in developing Chess.com was to open the sport to the wider community, with Rensch admitting that the game has at times been a “gatekeep community” by the “intellectually elite or (those who) want to revere and worship the intellectually elite.”“We were like: ‘This is wrong.’ And I saw that it was wrong from having failed to try to reach the mountain as a prodigy and (Chess.com CEO and co-founder) Erik (Allebest) saw that it was wrong as someone who always loved the game but felt kept out of the club,” Rensch said.As one of the biggest organizations in the sport, Chess.com has also had to weather its fair share of controversy, most notably a cheating scandal involving an accusation from Magnus Carlsen that Hans Niemann cheated in an over-the-board game. Niemann was eventually cleared of cheating in that particular match.Rensch said that the episode taught the people involved with Chess.com that it had “way more influence than we thought we did.”But despite the meteoric rise and the sway the site now has over the sport, Rensch and his colleagues see themselves as guiding hands.“We really are the shepherds of something that belongs to humanity and we do not take that for granted,” he said.","headline":"He is now a leading figure in the online chess revolution.

This leaves him with no viable path to a majority, unlike D66's young leader Jetten - who will still need to clinch the support of several other parties.As the counting of the votes will likely continue until the start of next week, party leaders will only convene next Tuesday to discuss what comes next, a parliament spokesperson said.During the campaign Jetten moved beyond his party's traditional themes of climate change and education, plunging into the divisive topics of immigration and a housing crisis. In the process he won over some voters who had previously looked to right-wing parties.The election was seen as a test of whether the far right can expand its reach or whether it has peaked in parts of Europe, and the outcome suggests there are some limits to its appeal.But with PVV tied for the top spot, it also showed the far right is also an enduring part of an increasingly fragmented political landscape at a time when many other parties have toughened their stance on immigration.Simon Otjes, assistant professor in Dutch politics at Leiden University, said the far right would continue to be strong. \"They'll dominate the public discourse,\" he said.However, with D66 being a very pro-European party \"we can expect a more active role for the Netherlands in Europe,\" Otjes said.","headline":"Dutch centrist Jetten confident of forming government after far-right's election setback","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/world/dutch-far-right-loses-ground-opening-door-centrist-coalition-talks-2025-10-30/","message":"That was a sharp drop for Wilders' party, which lost over a quarter of its seats in two years, stemming from a poor performance in its first attempt at government and growing competition on the right.

Broader concerns, including a worsening housing crisis, went unresolved in what voters saw as a chaotic year.\"I think it will be a warning to his populist colleagues everywhere in Europe, whether they are in Germany or Le Pen in France,\" said Dr. René Cuperus of the Clingendael Institute. \"You cannot screw up in government, that is the biggest lesson.\"Professor Sarah de Lange of Leiden University agreed that Wilders’ party had been punished for its lack of experience.\"We know from other cases like, say, Finland, Norway, even Austria, Italy, that parties (that) are more experienced ... can participate in very stable governments,” she said.Wilders was also weakened by isolation. Mainstream parties ruled out joining a coalition with him, arguing that his move to collapse his own government showed he is unreliable. That pushed some Wilders voters toward conservative rivals.That tactic doesn't always work, De Lange said. Once a party has been in government, voters assume it can be again. Wilders, who stayed in parliament to criticize his own coalition, maintained anti-establishment credibility through what she called a \"‘one foot in, one foot out’ strategy that has been very successful\" for Europe's populist movements.Wilders’ dominance on immigration has been blunted as rivals across the spectrum adopt tougher positions. His calls to deploy the army to patrol borders and deny all asylum claims energized his base but would breach Dutch and EU law. Centrist and leftist rivals instead promised faster deportations and closer cooperation with Brussels.De Lange said this fragmentation mirrors developments in Italy and France, where multiple far-right parties divide the vote but expand the overall pool of nationalist voters.\"I’m very cautious with saying there’s a limit to how many voters you can attract with a migration program,\" she said.Wilders’ hyper-centralized party structure also limited his growth. The Freedom Party has no members other than Wilders himself, who hand-picks candidates and enforces strict message discipline.As rival Dilan Yeşilgöz quipped in a debate, the Freedom Party “is just one guy with a Twitter account, there is nothing else.”That control has helped Wilders so far, but it hurts his chances with voters who see it as undemocratic.

Or so paleontologists thought.Researchers who spent the past five years studying the stunning collection of bones called the “dueling dinosaurs” say they have uncovered a case of mistaken identity, determining that the small-bodied dinosaur was not a juvenile T. Rex but rather a fully grown example of a hotly debated species known as Nanotyrannus lancensis.“We have the growth record preserved in the microstructure of the bone, which shows that it’s an adult,” said James Napoli, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University and coauthor of the new study published Thursday in the journal Nature. The discovery has triggered a rethink of many other fossils previously identified as teenage T. rex remains, Napoli added.Despite its relatively diminutive size, Napoli said that Nanotyrannus had larger upper limbs than a fully grown T. rex, which had famously tiny arms. “Bones don’t shrink when animals grow so this could not have possibly become an (adult) T. rex,” he added.The finding “flips decades of T. rex research on its head,” according to study coauthor Lindsay Zanno, associate research professor at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.“A wealth of studies on the biology of T. rex over the past three decades have unknowingly mixed data from Nanotyrannus with that of T. rex.Those studies need to be reevaluated in light of this discovery,” Zanno said in an email.However, scientists later shifted the narrative and interpreted that initial find and many other small Tyrannosaur fossils uncovered in the following decades to be juvenile T. rex specimens. The idea that another species might have produced the fossils fell out of favor, though the possibility was still debated at scientific conferences and other forums.“What’s exciting is that this discovery opens the door to a whole series of new questions about how these different predators — one built for brute strength and one built for speed — interacted in the twilight of the dinosaurs,” Zanno said.The study authors said they also had identified a fossil called “Jane” as a second species of Nanotyrannus, which they dubbed Nanotyrannus lethaeus. The name is a reference to the River Lethe, the river of forgetfulness in Greek mythology, a nod to how this dinosaur remained hidden in plain sight and “forgotten” for decades.The finding raises “uncomfortable” questions about why a scientific consensus came together so quickly around the idea that all Nanotyrannus specimens are juvenile T. rexes, said Larry Witmer, Chang Ying-Chien Professor of Paleontology at Ohio University. Witmer didn’t take part in the study.Many T. rex fossils, which can sell for tens of millions of dollars at auction, were commercially collected and are in private hands, making them difficult to study, he noted in a commentary published alongside the research.“This exceptionally researched study by Zanno and Napoli puts Nanotyrannus on a solid foundation,” Witmer said.“There is much more at stake here than declaring a victor in the debate, because there are literally decades of research and probably hundreds of publications based on a premise that this article overturns,” he said. “These analyses will all need revision.”Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology at the University of Edinburgh said the finding should prompt “a fundamental reassessment of tyrannosaur classification and evolution.”“For many years in my research on tyrannosaurs, I’ve considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as the famous skeletons of huge T. rexes to be juveniles of T. rex rather than a distinctive smaller species,” Brusatte, who wasn’t involved with the new study, explained.“Reading this new paper, I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong — at least in part,” he added.However, not every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton should be classified as Nanotyrannus, according to Brusatte. “T. rex was the size of a bus as an adult, and bones of adult T. rexes are very common across western North America, from Saskatchewan down to New Mexico,” he said.“Some of these must be juvenile T. rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult Nanotyrannus from teenage T. rex, as they were probably both very similar in size, and in their skeletal features,” he noted. “That will be the challenge for future paleontologists.”The evidence presented in the study that the smaller animal in the dueling dinosaurs fossil is in fact Nanotyrannus is “pretty conclusive,” according to Thomas Carr, a senior scientific advisor at the Dinosaur Discovery Museum and an associate professor of biology at Carthage College. However, fresh fossils are needed to understand the differences between Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named species of Nanotyrannus lethaeus, he said.Carr also said he isn’t sure about whether the fossil “Jane” should be reclassified as Nanotyrannus lethaeus, as the new research suggests. “They’ve done strong work, but we must be cautious,” said Carr, who wasn’t involved in the study.“There are some bones that are partially broken with a piece missing, but every individual bone is represented to some degree,” he said.The researchers hope skin or feathers might also be preserved in the sediment surrounding the remains and that there are injuries on the specimen, such as a broken finger, they haven’t yet explored.“There is a tremendous amount of science to do on the dueling dinosaurs,” Napoli said. “It’s an amazing fossil to work on.”","headline":"‘Dueling dinosaurs’ fossil forces a radical rethink of T. rex remains","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/science/dueling-dinosaurs-fossil-nanotyrannus-tyrannosaurus-rex","message":"A legendary fossil housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh features skeletons apparently locked in prehistoric combat — an epic meeting of two of the world’s favorite dinosaurs: Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex.

So it’s important you hear the voices. We’ve put together a full audio telling of the Ghost of Mrs. Kyle, complete with a crackly recording of an unconventional woman, who was drawn to ghosts and added to the story. We also recorded audio on the grounds of the girls’ boarding school where this tale takes place as I try to make my way up a creaky staircase.Enjoy! And afterward, be sure to catch our favorite audience-submitted ghost story, involving a headless motorcycle rider.The tale starts in a unique place: A private boarding school for girls in Loudoun County, Virginia. Five hundred acres of rolling Piedmont hills. I lived on campus. My father was the head cook. My mom was the baker and later ran the guest house.When the stars aren’t out, it’s dark. When the students are in their dorms, it’s dead quiet. The sound of your feet in the gravel echoes. It sounds like someone is following you.Steps from the dining hall, there’s an orchard. And on the edge of the orchard, there’s a tree. And under that tree, Mrs. Kyle was buried … twice.Our sole source is the school’s founder, Charlotte Haxall Noland, who told the story until the day she died.In colonial Virginia, a Mrs. Kyle lived in a brick home near an orchard with her husband. And like many good tales in this area of the country, there is a tie to a Founding Father — one of the original American influencers to lend extra weight to this kind of story.So in this one, Mrs. Kyle is connected to Mary Ball Washington, the mother of none other than George Washington. According to Miss Charlotte, Mrs. Kyle’s maiden name was Ball, a prominent colonial Virginia surname.Anyway, Mrs. Kyle had a baby … and reportedly went “crazy.” (Now, we’d call it postpartum depression.) And the treatment? Chaining her inside her own attic.How long she was chained there, how she reacted to her confinement, if she saw her newborn or even what happened to that baby — that’s never been a part of the story. Now, her prison, the attic, still exists. It’s atop a creaky wooden staircase on the third floor of what was their brick house.It was summer. Her husband was away on business. And somehow, the story goes, Mrs. Kyle got free from those chains, ran down the stairs, tripped, broke her neck and died. Due to the heat, she was immediately buried in the orchard, outside the veranda of the couples’ brick home.She spent her childhood riding horses, was presented at a debutante ball in Richmond, studied physical education at Harvard, went abroad to study at Oxford and eventually came back to the United States, determined to start a school.“So when I was a very little girl, my grandfather used to tell me about the ghost of Mrs. Kyle. How she walked all around this big place. I’ve always liked ghosts and tales about them.”Miss Charlotte lived in the same old brick house that Mrs. Kyle lived in, was chained in and died in.“She was kind and good. I could feel her right behind me, breathing on my neck as I walked up the steps. She’d go to a certain door there, and then she’d go on up in the garage and disappear.Even Miss Raymond, the first big head of Foxcroft, who lived in the house at the top of the steps — I hadn’t told her about Mrs. Kyle at all — and she said to me, “What is this? Are these footsteps that stop at my door and then go on up the steps?”There were a number of teachers who came to Foxcroft and people who worked there who knew there was something, some sort of spirit that moved around because I wasn’t the only one. I heard dozens of people talk to me about it. So you see, it wasn’t just my imagination.”So … Miss Charlotte wondered if Mrs. Kyle had unfinished business to take care of in this world. Miss Charlotte decided to dig into it … literally.“She was simply the spirit of a restless soul. Who couldn’t rest because they had something to tell us. What the something was, I had no idea.That was simply fascinating to the girls. So I told the ones who got the highest marks, they could come when I began to dig the graves. There was only about six girls. I got two good, stout men there, and we dug and dug and found nothing.The next day, we let the whole countryside come. That was everybody in the school and all our friends. It really was a funny gathering. And we began in real earnestness, four men digging instead of two. And there, we hit Mrs. Kyle’s bones.If you can imagine the excitement when they brought up the first ones: Nice little ladylike ribs. I was so glad to see them.It didn’t take very long now. And excitement was something beyond any words. Alice Jones leaned so far over the grave, yelling and looking at it, that she fell in. I’ve always thought what a horrible thing it would have been to have to write and say, “Dear Mrs. Jones, I’m so sorry your child broke her neck falling into Mrs. Kyle’s grave.” For I had no right to dig up a grave anyway.But she didn’t break anything. She stood down there and realized that the lump in front of her was Mrs. Kyle’s head, her skull. She it grabbed in her arms and two men who were down there, also in the coffin, in the grave, roped her under arms and they pulled her up.”“I’ll never forget, if I live to be a million years old, her triumphant look as she came up out holding the skull of Mrs. Kyle. It was wonderful.And I looked at the skull, holding it in my hands. She was shot right through the very top of her head, a big bullet hole.And the day after that, I wrapped it all — the skull — up in a newspaper, and I took it to Washington to the Smithsonian Institute.There's a ballistic department there. And I showed the skull to them. They took it and gave it the most minute examination. It's a wonderful place, that Smithsonian. There's nothing there they don't know, or if they don't know it, they can find it out.And brought it back to me within about a half an hour. Saying it’s a pre-Revolutionary bullet hole. Now, didn’t that answer the whole question? It did for me.You see, she did the most natural thing in the world. As she rushed down the steps, the man who was left to take care of her, just leaned over the banister and shot her right through the head.It’s the only way it could have been done, absolutely right in the middle. And then being scared to death to tell the husband how he shot her and what he did, they arranged to have her break her neck, falling down the steps.”I remember going to look for my best friends near those steps. We were always running in and out of that old brick house building, where our parents worked.I can see that door, that white door. And I’m not going up to the top of those stairs. There’s no reason for me to go up and bother that woman.I leave those stairs and walk around the campus. Foxcroft is a special place, not just to me. For generations, parents have sent their daughters to be educated in the spirit of Miss Charlotte: Determined, athletic and independent.The school is modeled after British boarding systems. Girls are sorted into houses. Here, it’s the foxes and the hounds. And they’ll be foxes and hounds for the rest of their lives.Students learn dressage and showjumping alongside history and science. The two houses compete in sports like field hockey and basketball. Of course, I never attended this school. But I studied it.The ritual goes like this: The foxes and the hounds hold a skit competition and the upperclassmen walk the younger students deep into the woods, to a tiny cemetery. Many years, students hear the scratchy audio recording of Miss Charlotte. Other years, students pass the legend by word of mouth.The recording takes on a different meaning when you’re in that context. I remember the first time I tagged along as a teenager, went down to the cemetery in the woods, holding a candle and hearing that tape.After she’d dug up Mrs. Kyle’s bones, Miss Charlotte supposedly had the remains examined by the Smithsonian Institution — I found no record of this examination.“We collected her rib bones and the ones that we dug up, put them all in a huge great Mason jar. It’s a jar that used to be old time pickle jars.”“Well, she’d gotten the story to us. She told what she wanted to, what we wanted to know and she wanted us to know. And now she rests right there under the tree at the back of the orchard house.”Our second helping of ghosts comes to us from Washington Post reader Candace Grant of Longmont, Colorado.My name is Candace Grant and I have a personal experience with the Headless Motorcycle Rider of Elmore, Ohio.According to this legend, the headless motorcycle rider was a soldier who had returned from World War I only to find the love of his life had married someone else. Heartbroken and furious, he sped off on his motorcycle and crashed. His head and the motorcycle’s headlight were never found.“For years, the story has been in this farming area that if a certain signal is given, a light from the bike appears, and the ghost crosses the bridge once again.”I decided to turn around and drive back past the old farmhouse. The boys begged me to go back. So I did. This time a corn shock, a vertical pile, almost like in a tepee shape of corn, stood right in the middle of the road. Something that definitely hadn’t been there minutes earlier. I thought it was very, very strange. Like, what the heck is going on here?So I drove around it, and we went back to the spot where we’d been waiting. I stopped the car and we started the signaling again. And again, nothing happened. I turned the car around, but this time the corn shock was scattered across the road. And the way it was scattered, it looked as though a car had driven through it.This time, in my side view mirror, I saw a single motorcycle headlight moving fast on a perpendicular road toward us. The light turned onto our road and sped closer and closer.After that, our adrenaline was just going wild. And I turned around, we went past the farmhouse again. The corn stalk was still scattered and we headed home.For the longest time, I’ve been thinking we were set up. I thought because we were led out there, I just had this feeling, but then I’ve read about the other people’s experiences on it, so I really don’t know what to make of it all. But it’s just fun memory. It is such a fun memory to have.And I think I’d rather now think it was something supernatural as compared to a setup because it just makes the story a lot more fun rather than being skeptical.Photos by Sarah L.

Mohammad’s family had been hopeful he would be released following Wednesday’s hearing.“The State Department is tracking Mr. Ibrahim’s case closely and working with the government of Israel on this case,” a US State Department spokesperson told CNN. “The Ambassador and the Embassy Jerusalem staff have been deeply involved in working on this case and continue to do so.”But Zaher Ibrahim says it took months for US efforts to truly ramp up, saying he felt betrayed by his own government.“What got us to this point is the pressure of the media and lawmakers on Capitol Hill,” Zaher said. “If it wasn’t for the pressure, I think they’d care less.”Twenty-seven US senators and representatives wrote a letter this month calling on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Huckabee to secure Mohammed’s “swift release,” expressing concern about the alleged mistreatment he has faced in Israeli prisons.A lawyer for Defense for Children International – Palestine visited Mohammed in prison and reported that he had “lost a considerable amount of weight” during his imprisonment and suffered from scabies.During his hearing on Wednesday, Mohammed reported stomach pain and headaches, his father said. One of the two guards flanking him during the hearing then called him a liar, according to Zaher.At one point, Mohammad tried to raise his cuffed hands to wave to his family. One of the guards slapped his hand away, his father said.“It’s just very, very sad,” Zaher said, his voice cracking. “You don’t know after they take him in – you don’t know if they’re gonna hit him again.”","headline":"Palestinian American teenager to remain in Israeli jail despite growing pressure in Congress for his release","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/middleeast/palestinian-american-teenager-remains-in-israeli-jail-intl","message":"An American teenager held in an Israeli prison without trial for more than eight months will remain in detention for at least another week and a half, despite growing pressure from US lawmakers for his release.

His announcement came shortly before a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, but he indicated China had not prompted his decision, telling a reporter later Thursday that “it had to do with others.”Trump’s order came just hours after Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin, visiting a military hospital in Moscow, dropped his latest nuclear bombshell. Sitting alongside the chief doctor and a carefully selected cast of Russian servicemen wounded on the front lines of the brutal war in Ukraine, Putin claimed that another “invincible” Russian weapon had been successfully tested.“The Poseidon’s power significantly exceeds that of our most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile,” the Russian president told his already war-scarred audience. “It is unique in the world,” he added, while intercepting the weapon would be “impossible.”Just days before the Poseidon announcement, the Kremlin strongman announced that Russia had successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Burevestnik – or Storm Petrel – claimed by its military to be capable of flying at subsonic speeds, using nuclear fuel, for virtually unlimited time and distance.Of course, there are serious technical doubts about the practicality of weapons that depend on notoriously unreliable, not to mention toxic, nuclear power. Their deployment, if it happens at all, is likely to be a long, long way off.For its part, the Kremlin sees its nuclear saber-rattling less as a direct military threat and more of a diplomatic tool: a cost-effective and immediate way of getting the US and the West at large to take notice; to give Moscow what it wants in Ukraine, and to focus minds on the potential existential threat that a provoked or denied Russia could pose.The Kremlin already feels both of those things over Ukraine: provoked most recently by the debate over whether or not to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, which would put targets in and around Russia’s biggest cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg under threat; and denied by the failure of Washington to force Ukraine and its European backers to accept Moscow’s maximalist terms to end the fighting in Ukraine.Certainly, the timing of the latest threats, as diplomatic progress with the United States has stalled, has been less than subtle.As Trump – frustrated by the Kremlin’s consistent refusal to immediately end its war in Ukraine – hinted at canceling a planned Budapest summit with Putin, before imposing sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil companies, the Russian president made sure he was pictured overseeing what he insisted were “planned” nuclear triad drills in which long-range missiles were test-launched from land, sea and air.It was a classic bit of Kremlin nuclear saber-rattling theater, but seemed to elicit little US response.Days later, the Burevestnik cruise missile tests were announced by Putin dressed, somewhat unusually, in a military uniform. But even that was waved off by a dismissive White House.“And I don’t think it’s an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday, on his way to Asia for a three-stop tour that included a landmark meeting with Chinese leader Xi.“He ought to get the war ended, a war that should have taken one week is now in its fourth year, that’s what he ought to do instead of testing missiles,” Trump added.But by ignoring that advice and then immediately announcing the testing of the nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo, potentially capable of wreaking radioactive destruction on entire coastal regions of the United States, the Kremlin may have inadvertently edged the White House into that decision to resume nuclear weapons tests of its own.It may be a lesson in the hazards of mixing loose talk with nuclear weapons in an increasingly volatile world. And what may have been intended by the Kremlin as a way of bolstering its arguments over Ukraine, has possibly plunged us all into new, dangerous and unpredictable era.","headline":"Nuclear saber-rattling from Trump and Putin signals a dangerous new era","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/europe/analysis-putin-russia-nuclear-threat-us-latam-intl","message":"The Kremlin’s constant nuclear boasts may have finally struck a chord in the White House, with President Donald Trump ordering the resumption of US nuclear weapons tests. “Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,” Trump wrote in a post on social media Thursday.

But experts say that the sudden and unexpected removal of sanctions against Dodik could allow him to continue to dominate Srpska, while demonstrating to other autocrats in the region that well-funded lobbying can reap rewards from Trump’s Washington.The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) did not explain why it had removed sanctions on Dodik, as well as dozens of his allies, his family members and companies linked to them. CNN has asked the Treasury Department for comment.The State Department said the decision was taken after Srpska’s National Assembly took “constructive actions” in recent weeks to “improve stability” in the country, in apparent reference to Srpska’s installation of an interim president after Dodik was stripped of the role in August and – after initially threatening to defy Bosnian authorities – stepped aside earlier this month.Since Trump’s return to the White House, Dodik’s overtures have been amplified by several allies of the president. Rod Blagojevich – the former Illinois governor who spent eight years in prison on corruption charges before being pardoned by Trump in February – has posted in support of Dodik for months.In a post on Wednesday thanking Trump for waiving the sanctions on Dodik, Blagojevich signed off: “This material is distributed by RRB Strategies LLC on behalf of the Republic of Srpska.  Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, DC.”Filings to the Justice Department show RRB Strategies, Blagojevich’s firm, signed a contract with the Srpska government in March, agreeing to “lobby state representatives to prevent what is perceived as a witch hunt against Srpska officials” and “seek the lifting of sanctions” against them. The value of that contract was redacted.This month, prominent MAGA figures joined the chorus of Trump allies championing Dodik’s cause. Laura Loomer, the far-right influencer with a direct line to the president, said Dodik’s removal as president of Srpska was “the latest example of the brazen assault against Trump-like leaders across the world.” She claimed Dodik – a “Christian” leader – was “enduring ruthless political attacks from a coalition of Muslims and globalists.”Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, called for Trump to “embrace” Dodik, and for the US to join forces with Srpska to defeat globalists “who seek all of our demise.”Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and Trump’s one-time personal attorney, visited Srpska in February and hosted Dodik on his podcast, displaying “Make Srpska Great Again” hats alongside Trump’s famous MAGA hats.Hoxhaj, the Balkan expert, said Dodik will use the sanctions relief to claim “to his people and to the public that he has been vindicated by the US, and that what was done to him was unjust.”US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced the lifting of sanctions as “reckless and premature.”“Dodik has undermined the Dayton Peace Agreement, cozied up to Putin and profited from corruption – hardly grounds for relief,” she said. “The American people deserve answers.”","headline":"US lifts sanctions on Putin-backed Bosnian Serb strongman after Trump allies’ lobbying","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/world/milorad-dodik-sanctions-trump-intl","message":"The waiving of sanctions on Milorad Dodik followed a months-long lobbying effort by allies of Donald Trump, which painted the Serb nationalist leader as a defender of “Christian values” in a country with a large Muslim population, and a victim of the sort of “lawfare” waged against the US president.

However, over the coming years at least, Taiwan will remain heavily fossil fuel-dependent and a stand-out customer for gas exporters.Enjoying this column?

Their assurances aren’t being taken at face value since their president routinely ignores the terms of deals and Congress’ constitutionally sound decisions on how to spend taxpayer money.Little is evident on the horizon that could prevent the monthlong shutdown from becoming the longest on record next week.In the absence of meaningful progress, dismayed lawmakers spent the day venting and trading insults.Democrats accused Republicans of starving kids. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of putting extreme pressure on air traffic controllers, implying they were risking the nation’s “extra safe” skies. And President Donald Trump — perhaps the sole agent with the capacity to change the political wind and end the shutdown — didn’t really say anything until a late-night post calling on GOP senators to abolish the filibuster to end the funding stalemate.West Virginia Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis said staying in town over the weekend “is gonna be a waste of time.” Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN’s Dana Bash he was shocked “at the level of cruelty” shown by his GOP colleagues.And renegade Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman has had it up to here with everyone. “It’s an absolute failure what occurred here for the last month,” Fetterman told CNN. He also complained about his own party’s tactics. “We can’t even get our sh*t together and just open up our government,” he said.Democrats might have some justification in arguing that Republicans and their health care policies and endless attempts to kill Obamacare set the stage for this crisis. But Republicans can also point to the great contradiction of the Democratic strategy: The shutdown has now become a test of which bloc of unfortunate Americans are hurting the most — those who risk losing health care or those who don’t have enough to eat.Shutdowns typically end when one party can’t bear the political price of the government staying closed. In many ways, these showdowns are Washington games that can define the course of presidencies and Congresses.But the fact that it’s now been a month and neither side is willing to blink is also a symptom of a broken political system and a Congress that can no longer do its basic constitutional task of funding the government. And any victory for either party at this point will be hollow, since it will be built on the suffering of citizens.One federal judge in Boston is doing what the judiciary often seems to do these days: stepping in where Congress has failed. US District Judge Indira Talwani signaled she will intervene in the dispute over the Trump administration’s refusal to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to fund food stamps under SNAP.“Right now, Congress has put money in an emergency fund for an emergency, and it’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits,” Talwani said in the kind of plain English that lawmakers seem to shed when they get to Washington.“The idea that we’re going to do the absolutely most drastic thing, which is that there’s not just less money but no money, seems the farthest thing from” what Congress intended, Talwani said. “We’re not going to make everyone drop dead” from hunger.Sometimes in Washington, the darkest hour is the one before dawn. So maybe there’s a chance the vicious rhetoric is a smokescreen allowing everyone to vent before they compromise.But there’s another characteristic of modern Washington that may be more apt right now — the way that disaster always has to nearly strike before two parties mired in their ideological extremes find a sliver of common ground.Majority Leader John Thune — who ditched his suave self-control on Wednesday to rage at Democrats in a Senate rant — struck one hopeful note when he said there was an uptick in bipartisan conversations this week. “We got members on both sides who are continuing to dialogue,” he told reporters.But Thune doesn’t yet have the political space to offer Democrats the kind of tangible deliverables they would need. “When they’re willing to produce the votes to open up the government, we’re going to talk,” he said, restating the sticking point.One possible endgame scenario is that the Senate could blur the sequencing of when the government reopens and talks get serious on Obamacare subsidies. But knowing how something might eventually end is easier than getting there.Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said he wasn’t worried about his own air travel as air traffic control snarls, but did “worry about the flights of thousands and thousands of people.” Mixing transportation metaphors, he accused Democrats of being “way off the rails.”And Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York followed his warning on Wednesday that Trump “is a vindictive politician and a heartless politician and a heartless man” by accusing Republicans of bringing down “the specter of financial disaster” on Americans — including in red states — over health care.","headline":"Bitter Washington blame game rages as pain grips needy Americans","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/politics/shutdown-snap-food-stamps-trump-congress-analysis","message":"Washington woke Thursday to a whiff of rare hope that behind-the-scenes efforts were accelerating in the Senate to end a federal shutdown now imposing severe pain on millions of Americans.

Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense. And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert.Hours after the president’s post, it did not appear as if the Pentagon was moving swiftly to test a nuclear weapon. Testifying on Capitol Hill, the senior military officer nominated to oversee the American nuclear arsenal said Thursday morning he was not “reading anything” into Trump’s Truth Social post — an indication, if one was needed, that the instructions hadn’t been previewed very widely ahead of time.The surprise message only underscored the volatile approach Trump is taking to foreign affairs nine months into his second administration. Even as he was about to sit down for a meeting intended to lend stability to the world’s most important bilateral relationship, Trump demonstrated his willingness to suddenly veer in an unexpected direction.“I think the president’s Truth speaks for itself,” Vice President JD Vance said as he took questions from reporters at the White House. “We have a big arsenal. Obviously, the Russians have a large nuclear arsenal. The Chinese have a large nuclear arsenal. Sometimes you’ve got to test it to make sure that it’s functioning and working properly.”“To be clear, we know that it does work properly,” he added later, “but you got to keep on top of it over time, and the president just wants to make sure that we do that.”Dating back to his first term, Trump has always maintained a somewhat complicated relationship to the nuclear weapons he can launch from a secure suitcase anywhere he goes.A product of the nuclear era, he recently voiced wariness at even mentioning the word itself: “We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president told generals last month. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”“The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country,” he wrote. “This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!”“With others doing testing, I think it’s appropriate that we do also,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he was returning to Washington.He said nuclear test sites would be determined later, and specified his message did not relate to China — even though he named the country specifically in his message. “It had to do with others,” he said vaguely.Some officials said Trump may have been prompted by Moscow’s test flights in recent days of nuclear-capable cruise missiles and torpedoes, though their existence was already known and the tests did not involve a nuclear detonation. There is also no US equivalent to those Russian systems that could be tested to demonstrate equivalence, because the US decided decades ago that developing those systems was unproductive, said a former Trump administration official who worked on nuclear issues.Beijing’s speedy buildup in nuclear weapons has nonetheless generated concern among administration officials, who regard the issue as yet another point of friction in an increasingly tense relationship. Xi presided over a flashy parade of China’s nuclear-capable missiles last month.“Russia has nearly completed their modernization of all of their nuclear forces, and China is modernizing, and they are growing their arsenal at a breathtaking speed,” Elbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defense for policy, said during his confirmation hearing this year.“I wouldn’t presume that the president’s words meant nuclear testing,” Vice Adm. Richard Correll, whom Trump tapped to head up US Strategic Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.“I believe the quote was, ‘start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,’” Correll went on. “Neither China or Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test, so I’m not reading anything into it or reading anything out to it.”The Trump administration has not changed the nuclear modernization policy that was put into place during the final year of the Biden administration, with the aim of pivoting the strategic plan to deter China’s nuclear buildup. But carrying out a nuclear test could set back that modernization strategy because it would reorient the focus of the officials working on those ongoing efforts, according to former US officials who worked on nuclear issues.There are also concerns among those officials that Trump declaring the intent for US nuclear testing would actually benefit China — not the US.“The mere suggestion that the US may resume nuclear testing could give the green light to China to resume explosive testing, and the Chinese would benefit comparatively more than anyone else if testing resumed. There is no technical reason for the US to do this now. But for China, it could technically advance their capabilities,” a former senior US official said.Yet Trump has long approached nuclear weapons with a combination of morbid fascination and bombastic threats.In August, he announced he was ordering two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. He never clarified whether he was referring to subs with nuclear weapon capabilities, or merely nuclear-powered subs.He and Kim eventually improved relations and met in person three times — though Trump was never able to convince the despot to abandon his nuclear weapons.Now, Trump appears hopeful to begin tests quickly — though just how quickly may depend on his willingness to break international rules.“If the United States needed to conduct an immediate nuclear test to, say, verify that some of its weapons were working or for political purposes, it could violate a whole number of treaties that ban doing that in the atmosphere. And that could happen in a matter of weeks or maybe months,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National Security Council, who now is director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.“But it’s not poised to conduct testing anytime soon, and it takes years to scientifically instrument a test to make sure you’re getting the data out of it that you need. And I also assume that states like Nevada and others would sue to block the president’s ability to do this. So we’re several years away from being able to conduct explosive nuclear tests.”","headline":"Trump said the US would begin testing nukes.

The directive took even many of Trump’s advisers off guard, according to officials, leading to unanswered questions about when, or if, the testing would actually begin.  Historically, it is the Department of Energy that maintains and tests the US nuclear stockpile, not the Department of Defense.  And engineers have said accurate tests can be conducted through computer simulation, not blowing up an actual warhead underwater or in the Nevada desert."},{"details":"President Donald Trump on Thursday urged congressional Republicans to unilaterally end the government shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster — urging them to take an unprecedented step that GOP leaders have firmly opposed until now.“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Top GOP lawmakers have long argued for keeping that threshold in place, asserting that the filibuster benefits Republicans — and will serve as a key safeguard against Democrats passing transformative legislation the next time they’re in power.Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this month ruled out changing the Senate rules to end the shutdown, calling the filibuster “something that’s been a bulwark against a lot of really bad things happening with the country.”But Trump on Thursday appeared to abruptly change course, arguing that Republicans should take advantage of their Senate majority to end the filibuster and reopen the government.“Now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying ‘SHUT DOWN,’” he wrote. “If the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it.”Trump’s new push followed a week on Capitol Hill where lawmakers on both sides signaled potential signs of progress toward ending the impasse, even as they conceded that a deal remained well out of reach despite widening fallout across the country.Critical food aid for tens of millions of Americans is slated to end over the weekend.

At least, doing so won't address the current problem, which is supporting the softening labor market.Alluding to this, Powell admitted that the job market is weakening primarily because of shrinking labor supply rather than cooling demand for workers.But lower borrowing costs are designed to boost demand for workers. If the job market's problems are \"mostly\" a function of labor supply, as Powell said, then cutting interest rates is akin to pushing on a string.\"So the question then is what does our tool do, which supports demand? Some people argue that this is supply, and we really can't affect it much with our tools. But others argue, as I do, that ... we should use our tools to support the labor market when we see this happening,\" Powell told reporters.Job growth has slowed in the U.S. over the past year, but this has been offset by a steep decline in the number of people looking for work. That's a result of the tighter immigration controls, increased deportations, and both young people and retirees leaving the labor force.Powell also said there's no evidence of a worrisome deterioration in the broader labor market, though the recent announcement of some high-profile corporate layoffs may suggest otherwise.What we appear to see taking shape is a so-called 'K-shaped' economy: the rich are getting richer from the asset price boom, while the rest are struggling.This curious balance is new for the Fed and a tricky one to navigate, especially with the government shutdown reducing visibility even further.Just as the Fed's blunt interest rate tool doesn't fix supply-side issues in the jobs market, it may not do much to support lower-income households and individuals either, even though ensuring a stronger labor market is the \"best thing\" the Fed can do for the American people.Cheaper money is also likely to benefit the richest cohorts by inflating asset prices even more, which may also push already lofty valuations to unsustainable levels.Six weeks is a long way off, but a third successive rate cut in December is suddenly in the balance. If the subtext of Powell's press conference is anything to go by, that may be for the best.Enjoying this column?

Black feathers spilling out the front of a beige car coat at Brandon Maxwell. An Altuzarra knit two-piece that made its wearer look like they had been tarred and feathered, but beautifully rather than as some heinous ancient punishment. A strapless gown that appeared cloud-like through rows and rows of delicate white plumes at Prabal Gurung.The London shows were in on the game too — the cascading, multi-colored plumage of a Roksanda evening gown, or feral, feather-stuffed Converse high tops at Oscar Ouyang. In Paris, designers moved with the synchronization of a swallow murmuration. Pierpaolo Piccoli’s proposition for Balenciaga rested on feather-work: There was the full, plume-covered maxi skirt paired with a casual T-shirt, since worn in the wild by Elle Fanning, as well as a number of boxy dresses finished with delicate feather trims.For Chanel, Matthieu Blazy set its specialist atelier Maison Lemarié on the task of creating feather Camellias, headpieces, earrings and large skirts. At Victoria Beckham the dresses were smaller, but no less quilled. Even The Row, the cult favorite of every millennial minimalist, dipped its toe into the showy textile with mid-length skirts that were given a feathery facade. Stella McCartney, fashion’s stalwart eco-warrior, joined in too with the invention of the world’s first plant-based alternative to feathers.There was Big Bird Energy all over the runways this season. But how did bird feathers become a symbol of luxury in the first place?Plumage has been in fashion since ancient Egypt, when ostrich feathers were used to decorate fans and even appeared in hieroglyphics. In Babylonian and Assyrian artworks, too, feathers are often seen covering the bodies of deities or embellishing royal crowns.Today, many fashion designers such as Donatella Versace, John Galliano and the late Giorgio Armani, have openly rejected the use of fur after decades of animal welfare campaigns — while luxury brands such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada and Burberry have also committed to going fur-free. Earlier this year Conde Nast announced it will no longer feature new animal fur in editorial content or advertizing across its numerous publications. But could the success of the anti-fur movement be fueling a plume boom?“With so many brands trying to move beyond animal-derived materials, it felt like the right moment to reimagine something so loaded with history and emotion,” Woollen told CNN in an email. “The conversation around materials has mostly focused on leather and fur. Feathers slipped through the next, and we wanted to change that,” West added.Despite the feather-filled runways of the latest season, it’s developments like Fevvers that keep Håkansson going. “What I hope people come to realize is that having policies in place that make fashion more ethical and sustainable is not restrictive of creativity,” she said. “It actually helps to produce more of it, because you have to think outside the box a bit more.”","headline":"The plume boom: Feathers are coming for your spring wardrobes","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/30/style/feathers-fashion-runway-shows","message":"First it took hold at New York Fashion Week.

Subscribe to watch the full exclusive report.“The Americans drove through here,” the Syrian army guard said, pointing to a steep road behind him. “I don’t know where they headed, I’m not allowed up there.”The barricaded road leads to a labyrinth of military facilities wedged into the rocky slopes of Mount Qasioun on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. It was as close as CNN could get to the locations searched by an FBI-led team that came here in September looking for traces of American journalist Austin Tice — more than a decade after he disappeared.The American team was hard to miss, arriving in a convoy of armored vehicles. Their objective was two-fold: to search for the place where Tice was last believed to have been held and, if possible, to find his remains.The US search focused on a facility called the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center. It lasted less than three days. On September 9, Israel launched its explosive attack on Qatar and the delegation abruptly left.“I don’t want to protect Bashar al-Assad because he abandoned and left us,” Al-Hassan added. “I don’t want to protect Russia or Iran, because the US thinks Russia and Iran have something to do with the case. And I can assure you that this is not the case. This relates to President Bashar only,” he said.Assad fled to Russia after the collapse of his regime and attempts by CNN to reach him were unsuccessful.Al-Hassan claims he passed the execution order onto a subordinate in the notorious Iran-backed, pro-government militia the National Defense Forces (NDF). CNN has learned the man in question is now in Russia. Through an intermediary, he refused to respond to CNN’s questions.Several sources that CNN spoke to claimed that there are holes in Al-Hassan’s story. CNN has confirmed that he failed a polygraph test given to him by the FBI.The truth is tangled in a web of lies that remain the enduring legacy of a regime that killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of its own people. In order to piece together what happened to Tice, CNN spoke to dozens of former and current officials, investigators and eyewitnesses in seven different countries. Many only spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters or protect their precarious status in the countries they fled to.While CNN cannot confirm that Tice is dead, for the first time we are hearing from people with direct knowledge of his capture, captivity and attempted escape. The accounts they provide strongly suggest that Tice was killed more than a decade ago, but there is no hard proof. Since the Assad regime fell last year, the new Syrian government has been keen to establish good relations with the US and has been working closely with American officials to help solve the Tice case. The FBI has ramped up its own investigation, collecting evidence on the ground.“As well as a recovery operation this is also an active federal investigation and there is always the goal of trying to bring some justice to this situation,” said a person familiar with the FBI investigation.“Austin Tice is alive. We look forward to seeing him walk free,” the Tice family told CNN in a statement.He filed his last report from Darayya, a Damascus suburb that still bears the marks of years   of fighting and bombardment. His family and editors said they lost contact with him in mid-August when he was supposed to travel to Lebanon for a break.Bahloul agreed to talk to CNN only after securing permission from the new government in Damascus. A security official led the way to his house up a leafy hill in Latakia, the coastal province in Syria known for its loyalty to the Assads. Unlike other former officials who fled Syria, Bahloul took a settlement offered by the new government that essentially gives him amnesty.“I went to [Al-Hassan’s] office and he told me, ‘We have caught an American journalist. We want you to interrogate and see the possibility if he’s not a mere journalist or if he’s a spy,’” Bahloul said.Bahloul, who has spent time in the US and the UK and speaks English fluently, told CNN he interrogated Tice three times. “I just went through the names and the contacts on his phone, asking him about each name,” Bahloul said. “He was cooperative about it. He told me that he’s an ex-Marine officer. He wasn’t shaky. He was brave enough to face his custody. Sometimes even we talked about music.”Tice was held in a Republican Guard compound often referred to as Tahoune, under the command of Ghassan Nassour, a senior officer who reported to Al-Hassan. The line between the Republican Guard and the NDF was often blurred with officers serving in both, including Nassour.When CNN visited the compound in September, it was mostly refurbished and used by soldiers of the new government. Faded Assad murals, discarded ammunition and bars on the windows of some rooms were the only traces left of the old guard.According to Nassour, the soldier who was assigned to bring food to Tice was instructed not to speak to him. Tice’s nationality and identity, Nassour claims, were known only to a handful of people close to Al-Hassan, whose office was across the road from Tahoune.Under the direction of Al-Hassan, regime soldiers dressed up as jihadists and led a blindfolded Tice up a hill while chanting “God is Great,” Nassour said. The point, he added, was to give the impression that Tice was held by extremists and not the Assad regime.“The video was posted online the next day, and it was as if Tice was held by Taliban in Afghanistan and he never entered Syria,” Nassour said. Tice was seen in the 46-second video reciting the Muslim proclamation of faith and pleading, “Oh, Jesus.”US officials and independent analysts quickly determined the video was a ruse. US investigators followed the digital breadcrumbs to the Syrian regime. It was taken as evidence that Tice was in government hands and the first and only proof of life.Back in Tahoune, sometime in late October, Tice asked Bahloul for soap and a towel, which Bahloul said Tice used to escape. Syrian investigators at the time, Bahloul explained, determined that Tice used the soap to slip through the high window and the towel to jump over the shattered glass cemented at the top of the compound’s external wall.The low-ranking soldier in Al-Hassan’s team described the ensuing havoc. “We were on a state of alert. There was chaos because someone had escaped prison,” the soldier told CNN. “They distributed his picture to the checkpoints close to the compound.”“Every security apparatus in Damascus, thousands of operatives, they started the search, and he was caught by one of them, and he was redelivered to the National Defense Forces militia, which was headed at that time by Bassam Al-Hassan,” Bahloul said.“I felt the connection between me and him was just lost. I was talking to him and he was not responding. He was, in a way we could say, depressed,” Bahloul recalled. “I never saw the guy again.”This time, Tice was taken to Al-Hassan’s office across the road from Tahoune. From there, the trail went silent, according to multiple Syrian intelligence and NDF commanders.“I stopped asking about the issue,” Nassour said. “In Syria if anyone hears that you’ve asked about what doesn’t concern you, you will be in trouble. I never asked again until the fall of the regime.”“He was sort of like a right-hand man to Bashar al-Assad, someone Bashar could absolutely trust, someone who Bashar could farm out his dirtiest jobs, his most unpleasant of tasks to,” said Economist journalist Gareth Browne who has covered Al-Hassan extensively since the fall of the regime.Al-Hassan has refused to talk to journalists and the only photographs of him online were incorrect or very old. In September, CNN obtained a recent photo of him, and a tip about where he was hiding out — an upscale apartment complex in a suburb of Beirut.A team from CNN spent an evening observing the buildings. One balcony and one man in particular appeared to match the photo. The next morning, CNN knocked on his door and asked him about Tice. He invited them in as soon as he heard Tice’s name.During the conversation, Al-Hassan appeared rattled that CNN had found him and repeatedly asked who told where he lived. He explained to CNN that he had recently told a team from the FBI that he had been holding Tice when Al-Assad gave him the order to execute him. According to multiple sources with knowledge of the interrogation, Al-Hassan also claimed that he tried to push back on Assad’s order but that the then-president was adamant.“You could say whatever you like about Bassam, but he is not the courageous guy… I couldn’t imagine him giving such, you know, ‘Sir, we shouldn’t.’ No, he doesn’t give such advice,” Bahloul said.Sources also described Al-Hassan as cunning, Machiavellian, and not someone to be trusted. In many ways, Al-Hassan embodied the culture of the Assad era.“You have to look at the nature of this regime. You know, these people are competing with each other. It’s riddled with rivalries. There are people lying and deceiving each other, even though they’re nominally on the same side,” said Browne, the Economist reporter.Both Nassour and Bahloul told CNN that when Tice was first captured Assad was pleased and saw him as a valuable card to be used in later negotiations with the US.“Assad knew about Tice and knew he could use him in negotiations. It would be extremely stupid to kill him… to let go of a winning card in your hand,” Nassour said.Others CNN spoke to believed it was plausible that Assad would order Tice’s execution, particularly after his escape.“It wasn’t logical for me. But I started to feel that there is something wrong happening around the case or around Austin,” General Abbas Ibrahim, Lebanon’s former spy chief, said of the failed negotiations during President Donald Trump’s first term.“The Americans were very interested in this case, and they were ready to pay any price to get [Tice] back,” Ibrahim said. “The regime in Syria had a big opportunity to save themselves [with] Austin, but they didn’t play this card because maybe they don’t have this card anymore,” he said.In the months after the Assad dungeons were flung open last year, the hope to find Tice and tens of thousands of missing Syrians began fading. Those who hadn’t emerged were presumed dead. Many of their families refuse to officially accept this until the remains are found. They still hope that the truth, buried in secret graves and hidden in millions of old government documents, could provide closure one day.It was only at the door on our way out that Al-Hassan’s voice cracked, saying he owed Tice’s mother an apology.“Truly, it upsets me to remember it. I wish what happened hadn’t happened,” Al-Hassan said. He removed his glasses revealing blood-shot eyes. “It was a predicament that I was burdened with.”Tice may simply be remembered as yet another victim of the endless lies and senseless cruelty of a ruthless regime.","headline":"CNN confronts the man responsible for holding US journalist Austin Tice captive","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/28/politics/al-hassan-austin-tice-update","message":"CNN’s Clarissa Ward confronts the man who held Austin Tice captive.

Now, scientists say they have identified the “happiness threshold” needed for a country’s population as a whole to achieve certain health benefits.“The evidence suggests that raising well-being while curbing obesity, alcohol use, and pollution could produce dual dividends: stronger happiness and healthier, longer lives.”Iuga hopes her team’s work has implications for governing bodies and public health organizations that can influence happiness and health at the population level. She plans to continue her research by testing the happiness threshold against other health metrics, such as years lived with a disability.This research adds to the existing body of literature linking happiness to health, said Sonja Lyubomirsky, a distinguished professor of psychology and director of the Positive Activities and Well-Being Laboratory, or PAWLab, at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study.“Traditionally, happiness is seen as a little bit of a luxury. It feels good,” Lyubomirsky said. The new study shows “that happiness could be the public health variable. It’s about more than just fun and pleasure.”Happiness is but one facet of a person’s health. Genetic, behavioral and environmental factors also play a role in the risk of dying from chronic disease.“We don’t want to leave people the impression that if only they were happier, they would be healthier, they would be fine,” Lyubomirsky said.“You don’t want to say, ‘If you don’t live as long, then it’s your fault because you’re not happy enough,’” she said. Not to mention, you only have so much control over your happiness as it relates to where you live. You might be born into a politically unstable country through no fault of your own or unable to afford to move out of an area with poor air quality.Having spent decades studying the well-being of individuals, Lyubomirsky said gauging the happiness of entire countries comes with challenges.“It’s really hard,” she said. “You cannot get a sample of every single person in the country, so you want to make sure that’s a representative sample.”Saida Heshmati, director of the Human Emotion and Relationships across Time and Culture, or HEART Lab, at Claremont Graduate University in California, said happiness isn’t the word she’d use to describe what the study is trying to measure.“When we say ‘happiness,’ people tend to think about experiencing more positive emotions — joy and having meaning in life and having a sense of accomplishment,” said Heshmati, also an assistant professor of psychology, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The (Life Ladder) doesn’t necessarily get into those components.”Heshmati referred to the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale, sometimes called Cantril’s Ladder, a standardized well-being assessment that serves as the basis for the Life Ladder scores in the study.“This isn’t about happiness as a fleeting emotion,” Heshmati said. “It’s really about this general life satisfaction cognitive evaluation, which is a reflection of whether societies are providing those material, social and psychological foundations for people to thrive.”“When you’re below that threshold, it seems you’re in stress mode and survival mode,” she said, which can have physiological consequences.While individual well-being adds up to represent the happiness of a nation, Heshmati cautions against applying the study’s conclusions to your own health and risk of death from chronic disease.“We can’t just say that becoming or feeling slightly happier directly changes your biology,” she said.Heshmati recommends thinking about your own happiness holistically. Simple pleasures matter, she said, but they come and go and can leave a sense of emptiness due to their fleeting nature. Instead, focus on lasting markers of well-being such as maintaining strong social ties, cultivating a sense of purpose and pursuing goals that make you feel accomplished.Award-winning health reporter Lindsey Leake is a former staff writer for Fortune and the USA Today Network who has contributed to WebMD, NBC News and Cancer Today.Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabThat is the finding of new research concluding that Nanotyrannus - which for years has been at the center of a debate among paleontologists as to whether it was merely a teenage version of Tyrannosaurus - was, in fact, its own distinct dinosaur.They also found that Nanotyrannus differed anatomically from its larger cousin by having more teeth, a crest in front of its eyes, an air sinus in a certain bone at the back of the skull and the presence of a vestigial third finger, unlike the two-fingered Tyrannosaurus.Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus both were members of a lineage of meat-eating dinosaurs called tyrannosaurs, but were not the same genus, the researchers said. A genus is a group of closely related species that share similar characteristics. For example, lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are from the same genus, Panthera, but each represents a different species.The genus name Tyrannosaurus means \"tyrant lizard,\" with the species name \"rex\" meaning \"king.\" The genus name Nanotyrannus means \"dwarf tyrant.\"\"T. rex was a massive predator adapted to wielding incredible bite forces. Nanotyrannus was a slender, agile pursuit predator that could have run circles around the tyrant king,\" said paleontologist Lindsay Zanno of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, lead author of the study published on Thursday in the journal Nature, opens new tab.\"Nanotyrannus and T. rex are extremely different,\" said paleontologist and anatomist James Napoli of Stony Brook University in New York, co-author of the study.Nanotyrannus was a predator built for speed and agility, with long legs, a long snout with blade-like teeth and strong arms for manipulating prey. Tyrannosaurus was a colossal predator that was built for strength, with stocky legs, an enormous head, thick, banana-shaped teeth and greatly reduced arms.\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli said.The researchers also determined that the Nanotyrannus specimens had sufficient anatomical differences to be divided into two separate species - Nanotyrannus lancensis and the newly named Nanotyrannus lethaeus. One of the Nanotyrannus fossils was part of the well-known \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" specimen, battling the horned dinosaur Triceratops at the time of death.Some scientific research into how Tyrannosaurus matured was based on the notion that the Nanotyrannus fossils represented T. rex juveniles, including studies that hypothesized that this apex predator experienced an extreme growth rate.\"For decades, paleontologists have unknowingly used Nanotyrannus specimens as a model for teenage T. rex to understand the biology of Earth's most famous dinosaur. Those studies need a second look,\" Zanno said.The finding that Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus shared the same landscape, along with myriad plant-eating dinosaurs, offers the latest evidence that dinosaur diversity was rich prior to the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that ended the age of dinosaurs.\"This discovery shows us that dinosaurs continued to evolve, innovate and diversify right up until their reign was cut short. This fits into a growing body of evidence proving that dinosaurs were not declining for millions of years before they went extinct, contrary to what we once thought,\" Napoli said.","headline":"Agile and vicious Nanotyrannus was not just a teenage T. rex","level":"reuters","link":"https://www.reuters.com/science/agile-vicious-nanotyrannus-was-not-just-teenage-t-rex-2025-10-30/","message":"A handout illustration shows a pack of the dinosaur Nanotyrannus attacking a juvenile Tyrannosaurus in what is now Montana 67 million years ago.

The leather it produces is eventually turned into products such as clothing, bags and other accessories by fashion brands such as Gabriela Hearst, Khaite, Catherine Holstein and Johanna Ortiz.Invasive species are animals and plants that are introduced due to human activity to an area where they are not native. They end up harming the local ecosystem, for example by eating native species, spreading disease or outcompeting other organisms for food or resources. They can cause extinctions and irreversible damage to the environment.“My co-founders and I firmly believed that one way to solve this problem was to tap into the power of the consumer,” Chavda added. “We then zeroed in on the fashion industry — it really wants to do better and it’s looking for healthier and more sustainable feedstock materials. We ended up turning the lionfish into leather, and that was the genesis of this wonderful idea. I’m here to make a structural impact on invasives, which the UN considers to be a top five driver of biodiversity loss.”“We are building a completely transparent, traceable and verifiable supply chain, all the way back to the hunting itself.”Chavda noted the tanning process is different from using cow hide — especially for fish skin, which is made up of very thin but also very strong fibers.Inversa said that it adheres to humane killing practices and is backed by American nonprofit environmental organization Conservation International and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others.Chavda said Inversa has removed tens of thousands of invasive animals. However, there is no definitive assessment on the effect of these removals on the habitats: “In the Everglades, we’re seeing anecdotal increases in native mammals in the areas we’re hitting hard, from our hunters. We can definitely tell that the alleviated pressure is helping.”Inversa’s work was assessed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Switzerland, which found it had a positive impact on biodiversity.Alexandra Ioanid, an associate professor at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest, Romania, who has done research on invasive species and is not involved with Inversa, said that turning invasive species into a valuable material addresses two challenges at once: “It helps reduce the ecological damage caused by species that threaten native ecosystems, and it offers a more sustainable alternative to conventional leather. Technically, it’s exciting to see that leather made from invasive species can reach the quality and versatility required for real-world use.”With the right tanning methods, Ioanid added, these alternative leathers can perform on par with traditional materials — and have a distinctive texture and aesthetic of their own: “If done responsibly, such initiatives can create economic incentives for removing invasive species, support local livelihoods, and contribute to conservation goals. The key is maintaining traceability and ecological oversight to ensure that these materials genuinely help manage invasives rather than encouraging new harvesting.”However, selling materials sourced from wildlife, non-native or not, can stimulate markets that promote unrestricted or incentivized killing, encourage intensive wildlife farming and trigger unintended consequences, such as the deliberate release of these species to sustain supply, according to PJ Smith, fashion policy director for Humane World for Animals, a nonprofit that fights animal cruelty.“Wildlife conservation efforts should prioritize the development of effective nonlethal management strategies that provide long-term solutions to address negative impacts from non-native species over fueling demand for luxury goods. There is a growing consumer demand for true, sustainable, bio-based leather alternatives that are animal-free and help restore ecosystems without the exploitation,” Smith added.Deah Lieurance, an assistant professor of Invasive Species Biology and Management at Penn State University, said that the populations of invasive species that Inversa harvests are so high that she’s doubtful the company could have any significant impact on restoration: “I do think these types of projects do have one major benefit,” she added, “they bring greater public awareness to the wicked problem of biological invasion.”","headline":"Invasive alien species are being turned into bags and belts","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/world/inversa-leather-invasive-species-spc","message":"Leather has been a staple of human fashion for millennia, but the fashion industry is increasingly embracing more sustainable alternatives.

Pythons from Florida’s Greater Everglades, silverfin carp from the Mississippi River Basin and lionfish from Caribbean reefs are the three alien invasive species that Miami-based startup Inversa currently harvests.  The leather it produces is eventually turned into products such as clothing, bags and other accessories by fashion brands such as Gabriela Hearst, Khaite, Catherine Holstein and Johanna Ortiz."},{"details":"Each nominee must pass through several steps before the position is filled, including a formal nomination, a referral to at least one Senate committee, a committee hearing and an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.Nominees who were confirmed during the Biden administration were presumed to have resigned unless they were serving in a termed position or publicly available information indicates they have continued serving into the Trump administration.The tracker includes all full-time, civilian positions in the executive branch that require Senate confirmation except for judges, marshals and U.S. attorneys. Military appointments and part-time positions requiring Senate confirmation are not included.There are officials who were confirmed during previous administrations for fixed periods of time and continue to serve because their terms have not expired.The tracker does not show officials serving in an acting capacity, so positions unfilled by Trump are not necessarily vacant. All presidents appoint some temporary officials to Senate-confirmed positions to preserve continuity during transitions between one confirmed official and another. While acting officials for high-profile positions are often widely reported, temporary officials for lesser known positions are often not reported publicly — or are done so inconsistently.The numbers in the tracker capture nonconcurrent positions. For example, a nomination to be the ambassador of the General Assembly of the United Nations and a separate nomination to be the representative of the United States in the U.N. Security Council are considered a single nomination.The tracker will be updated daily as positions are considered and filled. When the frequency of confirmations decreases, the tracker will be updated on a weekly basis.Presidents formally nominate individuals to the Senate to fill each position, a responsibility established in the Constitution. The Senate refers most nominations to a specific committee with jurisdiction over the position. Committees scrutinize the nominees and hold hearings to discuss their views, qualifications and histories. After the hearing, committees usually take a vote on whether to report out the nomination favorably, unfavorably or without recommendation. Or they can vote to take no action on the nomination.A nomination generally goes to the full Senate for a final vote if a majority of the committee votes favorably, but this isn’t required to get a final vote. Many nominations are approved through a unanimous consent agreement that limits debate and speeds up the process. For nominees subject to a vote, a simple majority is necessary to win confirmation. The Senate has rules that allow for individual senators to voice concerns about the nomination process.Most nominations that go to the Senate are ultimately successful. However, some do not receive a Senate vote, either because their nominations are withdrawn by the president or because the Senate calendar year ends before a vote takes place. By law, nominations not confirmed by the end of the year are automatically withdrawn, and the president must resubmit them to be considered again the following congressional session.Most of the information regarding nominations and the Senate’s process comes from Congress.gov, the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. Information about Senate-confirmed positions generally comes from the “United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions,” known as the Plum Book, published by Congress every four years. However, each administration may add new positions and organizations, or change position titles. The tracker reflects those changes when they are made public.Information on resignations and informal appointee announcements comes from publicly available sources such as news stories and government websites. The government does not publish any single, up-to-date source of information on the status of these positions. In some cases, public information on the status of certain officials or positions is inconsistent or nonexistent. The information provided in this tracker is based on the best publicly available details.There’s a slight chance. The Partnership for Public Service and The Post have staff members and processes devoted to following nomination and confirmation developments. However, the federal government does not have a uniform method of reporting appointee employment statuses, and occasionally, a change will occur with little or no media coverage. It is possible changes will occur that are not yet identified in the tracker, especially for lower-profile positions.

We’ve put together a full audio telling of the Ghost of Mrs. Kyle, complete with a crackly recording of an unconventional woman, who was drawn to ghosts and added to the story. We also recorded audio on the grounds of the girls’ boarding school where this tale takes place as I try to make my way up a creaky staircase.Enjoy! And afterward, be sure to catch our favorite audience-submitted ghost story, involving a headless motorcycle rider.The tale starts in a unique place: A private boarding school for girls in Loudoun County, Virginia. Five hundred acres of rolling Piedmont hills. I lived on campus. My father was the head cook. My mom was the baker and later ran the guest house.When the stars aren’t out, it’s dark. When the students are in their dorms, it’s dead quiet. The sound of your feet in the gravel echoes. It sounds like someone is following you.Steps from the dining hall, there’s an orchard. And on the edge of the orchard, there’s a tree. And under that tree, Mrs. Kyle was buried … twice.Our sole source is the school’s founder, Charlotte Haxall Noland, who told the story until the day she died.In colonial Virginia, a Mrs. Kyle lived in a brick home near an orchard with her husband. And like many good tales in this area of the country, there is a tie to a Founding Father — one of the original American influencers to lend extra weight to this kind of story.So in this one, Mrs. Kyle is connected to Mary Ball Washington, the mother of none other than George Washington. According to Miss Charlotte, Mrs. Kyle’s maiden name was Ball, a prominent colonial Virginia surname.Anyway, Mrs. Kyle had a baby … and reportedly went “crazy.” (Now, we’d call it postpartum depression.) And the treatment? Chaining her inside her own attic.How long she was chained there, how she reacted to her confinement, if she saw her newborn or even what happened to that baby — that’s never been a part of the story. Now, her prison, the attic, still exists. It’s atop a creaky wooden staircase on the third floor of what was their brick house.It was summer. Her husband was away on business. And somehow, the story goes, Mrs. Kyle got free from those chains, ran down the stairs, tripped, broke her neck and died. Due to the heat, she was immediately buried in the orchard, outside the veranda of the couples’ brick home.She spent her childhood riding horses, was presented at a debutante ball in Richmond, studied physical education at Harvard, went abroad to study at Oxford and eventually came back to the United States, determined to start a school.“So when I was a very little girl, my grandfather used to tell me about the ghost of Mrs. Kyle. How she walked all around this big place. I’ve always liked ghosts and tales about them.”Miss Charlotte lived in the same old brick house that Mrs. Kyle lived in, was chained in and died in.“She was kind and good. I could feel her right behind me, breathing on my neck as I walked up the steps. She’d go to a certain door there, and then she’d go on up in the garage and disappear.Even Miss Raymond, the first big head of Foxcroft, who lived in the house at the top of the steps — I hadn’t told her about Mrs. Kyle at all — and she said to me, “What is this? Are these footsteps that stop at my door and then go on up the steps?”There were a number of teachers who came to Foxcroft and people who worked there who knew there was something, some sort of spirit that moved around because I wasn’t the only one. I heard dozens of people talk to me about it. So you see, it wasn’t just my imagination.”So … Miss Charlotte wondered if Mrs. Kyle had unfinished business to take care of in this world. Miss Charlotte decided to dig into it … literally.“She was simply the spirit of a restless soul. Who couldn’t rest because they had something to tell us. What the something was, I had no idea.That was simply fascinating to the girls. So I told the ones who got the highest marks, they could come when I began to dig the graves. There was only about six girls. I got two good, stout men there, and we dug and dug and found nothing.The next day, we let the whole countryside come. That was everybody in the school and all our friends. It really was a funny gathering. And we began in real earnestness, four men digging instead of two. And there, we hit Mrs. Kyle’s bones.If you can imagine the excitement when they brought up the first ones: Nice little ladylike ribs. I was so glad to see them.It didn’t take very long now. And excitement was something beyond any words. Alice Jones leaned so far over the grave, yelling and looking at it, that she fell in. I’ve always thought what a horrible thing it would have been to have to write and say, “Dear Mrs. Jones, I’m so sorry your child broke her neck falling into Mrs. Kyle’s grave.” For I had no right to dig up a grave anyway.But she didn’t break anything. She stood down there and realized that the lump in front of her was Mrs. Kyle’s head, her skull. She it grabbed in her arms and two men who were down there, also in the coffin, in the grave, roped her under arms and they pulled her up.”“I’ll never forget, if I live to be a million years old, her triumphant look as she came up out holding the skull of Mrs. Kyle. It was wonderful.And I looked at the skull, holding it in my hands. She was shot right through the very top of her head, a big bullet hole.And the day after that, I wrapped it all — the skull — up in a newspaper, and I took it to Washington to the Smithsonian Institute.There's a ballistic department there. And I showed the skull to them. They took it and gave it the most minute examination. It's a wonderful place, that Smithsonian. There's nothing there they don't know, or if they don't know it, they can find it out.And brought it back to me within about a half an hour. Saying it’s a pre-Revolutionary bullet hole. Now, didn’t that answer the whole question? It did for me.You see, she did the most natural thing in the world. As she rushed down the steps, the man who was left to take care of her, just leaned over the banister and shot her right through the head.It’s the only way it could have been done, absolutely right in the middle. And then being scared to death to tell the husband how he shot her and what he did, they arranged to have her break her neck, falling down the steps.”I remember going to look for my best friends near those steps. We were always running in and out of that old brick house building, where our parents worked.I can see that door, that white door. And I’m not going up to the top of those stairs. There’s no reason for me to go up and bother that woman.I leave those stairs and walk around the campus. Foxcroft is a special place, not just to me. For generations, parents have sent their daughters to be educated in the spirit of Miss Charlotte: Determined, athletic and independent.The school is modeled after British boarding systems. Girls are sorted into houses. Here, it’s the foxes and the hounds. And they’ll be foxes and hounds for the rest of their lives.Students learn dressage and showjumping alongside history and science. The two houses compete in sports like field hockey and basketball. Of course, I never attended this school. But I studied it.The ritual goes like this: The foxes and the hounds hold a skit competition and the upperclassmen walk the younger students deep into the woods, to a tiny cemetery. Many years, students hear the scratchy audio recording of Miss Charlotte. Other years, students pass the legend by word of mouth.The recording takes on a different meaning when you’re in that context. I remember the first time I tagged along as a teenager, went down to the cemetery in the woods, holding a candle and hearing that tape.After she’d dug up Mrs. Kyle’s bones, Miss Charlotte supposedly had the remains examined by the Smithsonian Institution — I found no record of this examination.“We collected her rib bones and the ones that we dug up, put them all in a huge great Mason jar. It’s a jar that used to be old time pickle jars.”“Well, she’d gotten the story to us. She told what she wanted to, what we wanted to know and she wanted us to know. And now she rests right there under the tree at the back of the orchard house.”Our second helping of ghosts comes to us from Washington Post reader Candace Grant of Longmont, Colorado.My name is Candace Grant and I have a personal experience with the Headless Motorcycle Rider of Elmore, Ohio.According to this legend, the headless motorcycle rider was a soldier who had returned from World War I only to find the love of his life had married someone else. Heartbroken and furious, he sped off on his motorcycle and crashed. His head and the motorcycle’s headlight were never found.“For years, the story has been in this farming area that if a certain signal is given, a light from the bike appears, and the ghost crosses the bridge once again.”I decided to turn around and drive back past the old farmhouse. The boys begged me to go back. So I did. This time a corn shock, a vertical pile, almost like in a tepee shape of corn, stood right in the middle of the road. Something that definitely hadn’t been there minutes earlier. I thought it was very, very strange. Like, what the heck is going on here?So I drove around it, and we went back to the spot where we’d been waiting. I stopped the car and we started the signaling again. And again, nothing happened. I turned the car around, but this time the corn shock was scattered across the road. And the way it was scattered, it looked as though a car had driven through it.This time, in my side view mirror, I saw a single motorcycle headlight moving fast on a perpendicular road toward us. The light turned onto our road and sped closer and closer.After that, our adrenaline was just going wild. And I turned around, we went past the farmhouse again. The corn stalk was still scattered and we headed home.For the longest time, I’ve been thinking we were set up. I thought because we were led out there, I just had this feeling, but then I’ve read about the other people’s experiences on it, so I really don’t know what to make of it all. But it’s just fun memory. It is such a fun memory to have.And I think I’d rather now think it was something supernatural as compared to a setup because it just makes the story a lot more fun rather than being skeptical.Photos by Sarah L.

We now have data that shows how much more people will pay.The magnitude of the change depends on where people live, how old they are, and what they earn. (More details below.)This funding is at the heart of the congressional fight that has left the government shut down for nearly a month. Democrats have demanded an extension as a condition of their support for a government funding bill. Republicans have said they won’t consider an extension until the government is reopened.The numbers in our charts and maps come from researchers at the health research group KFF, and reflect insurance prices published on healthcare.gov and state websites that allow people to “window shop” before Saturday, when insurance marketplaces will open for business. An earlier version of this article included estimated premiums for insurance next year, but now we can show the real prices Americans are currently facing.Congress could still act and change the funding structure, but probably not before people start picking health plans this week.But where people live also matters. Premiums tend to be higher in rural areas, and they are particularly high in a handful of very rural states, like Wyoming and West Virginia.People with even higher incomes have to pay a lot for Obamacare health insurance, with or without the extra subsidies.Many younger people who earn this much haven’t seen any benefit from the extra subsidies. The subsidies kick in only when the cost of insurance is more than 8.5 percent of their income, which comes up only in the most expensive markets.But some older people with high incomes do save money with the extra subsidies. Without them, they will pay even more than they already do.This group is also affected by rising premiums. Even though the subsidies didn’t help many of them this year, they still paid lower premiums than insurers are offering in most markets for next year.Our charts and maps focus on how subsidies affect individuals buying insurance. The math is a bit more complicated for people who are buying insurance for their whole family. But the basic patterns are similar: Families at lower incomes would face more uniform increases, while families at higher incomes would see variable price increases, depending on where they live and the age of each family member.You can estimate your personal household costs with and without the subsidies using this calculator from KFF.","headline":"How Much Obamacare Prices Are Rising Across the U.S.","level":"nytimes","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/30/upshot/obamacare-subsidies-new-prices.html","message":"Prices for next year’s Obamacare health insurance plans became public this week, with big increases in premiums across the country.

Blood spatters, footprints and tire marks are the only traces of the crime he has just committed, but a trace is all it takes for the hunter to become the hunted.Last October’s pursuit ultimately began much further afield, in the sleepy Welsh town of Carmarthen, where Shinga was born and raised. It’s home to the kennels of Dogs4Wildlife, a non-profit organization that trains dogs to support anti-poaching units (APUs) in their efforts to protect endangered wildlife across southern Africa.“It was quite a horrific image. We sat down and we said, ‘Okay, that’s really affected us,’” Priddle told CNN.“We can deploy dogs in the UK to track people … to look for drugs, firearms and explosives, so why could we not look at developing the dogs that we were training for conservation efforts?”They usually breed one or two litters each year. Dutch shepherds and Belgian Malinois are two of the most common breeds for tracking, while labradors and spaniels are typically the detection (sniffer) dogs of choice.Training begins from as early as two days old. Priddle acknowledges that sounds young, but he believes early imprinting programs can provide a strong foundation for the formal training that commences around six weeks later.“There’s a lot of scientific study out there that’s been documented on exposing puppies to touch, different temperatures, different surfaces and textures, as well as different odors that we put into the whelping box when they’re very young,” he explained“It just helps their brain and (helps) their synapses to fire. We see a lot of advancement in those puppies.”The curriculum closely follows that of the typical police or security dog, focusing on obedience, tracking, and scent detection – a skill used to sniff out rhino horn, elephant ivory and bushmeat.The only key difference to the training process is acclimating dogs to the sights, sounds and smells of lions, giraffes and the myriad other species they will help protect. With rhino and elephant numbers severely lacking in the wetlands of Carmarthenshire, trips to local zoos are organized to desensitize the puppies to African wildlife.“The transition from spending every waking moment with that dog, having a very strong relationship, to then letting that go is challenging and difficult,” Law said.Easing the pain are WhatsApp group chats set up for Priddle and Law to keep in touch with and advise APUs across the various reserves and conservancies.They are particularly active forums, especially given that the organization also provides training and consultancy to teams with existing dog units, such as the Akashinga Rangers, Africa’s first armed all-female anti-poaching squad, who watch over Zimbabwe’s vast Phundundu Wildlife Area.Such victories demonstrate the “game-changing” value such dogs can have when incorporated into conservation efforts, argue the duo, even through their mere presence.“When these reserves bring a specialist dog onto a wildlife reserve … the word spreads very quickly that the APUs now have the capability to actually catch these poachers on a more efficient and successful basis,” Priddle said.“Some of the smaller wildlife reserves almost eradicate poaching in all types completely, just because of the deterrent value that dog brings to the party.”And on numerous occasions Shinga and Murwi have alerted units to potentially mortal threats – be it from poachers or predators – through body language alone.“They’ve saved our guys on the ground on several occasions and they’ve been responsible for apprehending quite a few poachers,” Travers told CNN.“It’s had a massive impact on security for Imire. We’ve had a drastic reduction in poaching and the K9 unit has a massive role to play in that … It’s not the silver bullet but it’s a tool that will make a significant difference.”And the impact of each loss extends far beyond statistics, Priddle and Law explain, especially at the smaller reserves that Dogs4Wildlife focuses on, which have markedly less anti-poaching resources than the continent’s most renowned parks.“The vegetation they clear, the seeds they disperse, all the other animals that are impacted. You think it’s just a rhino that’s gone – it’s the whole ecosystem that suffers,” Law explained.As Dogs4Wildlife looks ahead to its long-term goal of one day opening a specialized training and canine school within Africa, mobilizing future generations has become a key part of its overall mission.Law said that for local people to want to protect rhinos, they must first see the animals’ value to the environment.“We have to start at the fundamental basics, which is children taking responsibility for their own wildlife,” she added.","headline":"Meet the Welsh puppies that are stopping wildlife poachers in Africa","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/dog-training-poaching-africa-wales-spc","message":"Fresh warthog carcass in tow, a poacher speeds away from Zimbabwe’s Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservancy.

But I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about, the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that,” Johnson said.Asked how that conversation played out, Trump told reporters on Air Force One: “I don’t want to even talk about that, because, you know, the sad thing is, I have my highest numbers that I’ve ever had.”He later added: “I would say that if you read it, [the Constitution] it’s pretty clear, I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad. But we have a lot of great people.”That attention intensified last week when The Economist published an interview with Steve Bannon, a MAGA influencer and former Trump adviser, who claimed “there is a plan” for Trump to run for a third term.Bannon is notably far less close to the president and his team than he was during Trump’s first term, and some White House officials viewed his comments as an attempt to draw attention to himself.Johnson’s quickly throwing cold water on the suggestion underscores how little support Trump would have if he actually tried to move forward with it, even among key Republican party figures.Trump also recently ruled out one proposed end-run around the Constitution, saying it would be “too cute” for him to run as vice president in order to later ascend back into the White House after the elected president resigned.“I think the people wouldn’t like that because it’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right,” he said, although he tried to reserve the legal right to do it.","headline":"Trump says it’s ‘pretty clear’ he’s not allowed to run for a third term","level":"cnn","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/29/politics/trump-says-clear-no-third-term-intl-hnk","message":"President Donald Trump has said it is “pretty clear” the US Constitution does not permit him to run for the third term in office, after days of speculation prompted by claims from allies there was a plan to let him do just that. “I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had,” he told reporters on board Air Force One as he flew to South Korea where he is attending a regional summit as part of a whirlwind tour of Asia. “And, you know, based on what I read, I guess I’m not allowed to run so we’ll see what happens,” he said.

In a broadcast on Monday, he stated that his troops retreated from the city due to the destruction and systematic killing of civilians.Justin Lynch, a Sudan researcher and managing director of Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and conflict monitoring organization, told CNN that the RSF’s capture of El Fasher marks “the beginning of what we fear to be a massacre of civilians.”According to Tom Fletcher, the United Nations humanitarian chief, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in El Fasher, lacking food and health care. He reported that escape routes have been blocked amid “intense shelling and ground assaults” that “have engulfed the city.”The RSF has claimed it is committed to protecting civilians in El Fasher and providing safe corridors for those seeking to leave.However, the UN Human Rights Office said it had received “multiple, alarming reports” of the RSF committing atrocities including summary executions of civilians, and videos showing dozens of unarmed men being shot or lying dead surrounded by RSF fighters.According to Jalale Getachew Birru, a senior analyst at the crisis-monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there is a “high risk of ethnically targeted attacks, particularly against non-Arab groups.”Both generals have faced Western sanctions due to their involvement in war crimes. However, Dagalo’s RSF, along with its allied Arab militias, has been accused by the United States of committing genocide during the ongoing civil war. This marks the second time in two decades that the US has declared genocide in Sudan.The US government said when making the declaration in January that the RSF had executed “direct attacks against civilians,” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”Furthermore, it said, they had “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” and “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”Sudan’s military government has accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying weapons to the RSF, although the UAE has denied this.The recent killings in El Fasher and other areas of Darfur reflect a pattern of targeted violence similar to that seen during the earlier genocide.The RSF’s seizure of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, represents a significant turning point that allows the group to strengthen its hold on the broader Darfur region, according to Birru.It comes in the wake of the SAF regaining control of the country’s capital, Khartoum, from the RSF earlier this year.Fighting is now expected to shift to the central and oil-rich Kordofan region, which borders Darfur, according to Birru.The RSF announced on Saturday it had taken Bara, a crucial transport hub in North Kordofan state that connects the strategic town to the rest of the country.“In Kordofan, the SAF and its allies are seeking to secure key routes connecting central Sudan to the Darfur region, while the RSF is working to consolidate control across both regions to rein in its alternative government in western Sudan,” Birru said.“The outcome of battles in El Fasher and Kordofan will likely determine the future trajectory of Sudan’s conflict and the country’s political future,” she added, amid a global push for a ceasefire.International human rights lawyer Yonah Diamond told CNN that the international community must intervene as violence escalates in Sudan and civilian casualties increase in El Fasher, asking whether world leaders would allow the RSF “to commit another genocide in Darfur with impunity.”“The time for emergency action is right now – to end the bloodshed, open humanitarian corridors, and protect the people of El Fasher and what’s left of any global conscience,” he said.","headline":"Bloodbath feared as rebels trap thousands in Sudan city.
