[{"details":"US President Donald Trump has arrived in Asia for a whirlwind week of diplomacy, which includes a much-anticipated meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.Top of the agenda will be trade – an area where tensions between the world's two biggest economies have once again been ramping up.Trump landed in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, as a summit for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, begins on Sunday. He will then visit Japan and finally South Korea, where the White House says he will meet Xi.So what are the wins Trump and other leaders are hoping for, and what are the pitfalls?Our correspondents explain what you should know about the week ahead.By Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondentInking new trade deals that provide opportunities to American businesses while keeping the tariff revenue flowing into the US Treasury is sure to be a central focus of Trump's Asia trip.While there are multiple players in the global trade dance, the key to Trump's success or failure is China. And Trump's scheduled meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec – the first since 2019 – could set the course for US-China relations for the rest of Trump's second term in office.As the US president has acknowledged, draconian tariffs on Chinese imports are unsustainable. And while he has not explicitly said so, an escalating economic war with America's largest trading partner would have devastating consequences – for the US, for China and for the rest of the world.The steep tumbles in the major US stock indexes every time China and the US appear at an impasse underlines this reality.When he heads back to America next week, Trump is sure to be pleased if he is able to finalise a deal with South Korea and secure new Japanese investment in US manufacturing.But his top priority is sure to be convincing Xi to resume purchases of American agricultural exports, loosen recent restrictions on foreign access to Chinese rare earth materials, give US companies greater access to the Chinese market and avoid a full-blown trade war.For Trump, as the saying goes, that's the whole ballgame.By Laura Bicker, China correspondentWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping meets Trump on 30 October in South Korea, he wants to be the tougher negotiator.That is why he has been leveraging China's stranglehold on rare earths, the minerals without which you cannot make semiconductors, weapons systems, cars or even smartphones. It's a US weakness, and China is exploiting it – just like it is hurting American farmers, and Trump's rural vote base, by not buying their soybeans.Xi has also learned lessons from Trump 1.0 and this time, Beijing, it appears, is willing to embrace the pain of tariffs. For one, the US, which once took in a fifth of Chinese exports, is no longer such a crucial market.Still Xi has a balance to strike, between an economic battle with the US, and his struggle with domestic challenges. And Washington knows about Xi's troubles: high youth unemployment, a real estate crisis, mounting local government debt and a population unwilling to spend.Analysts believe China may offer to do a deal if Trump agrees to start exporting advanced AI chips or pull back on more military support for Taiwan.But getting there won't be easy. One big difference is that it often seems like Trump is willing to roll a dice and gamble – but Xi is playing a much longer game.So the question may be: can Trump wait it out?By Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondentThe US president appears interested in one thing only during his visit to Malaysia: playing the starring role in a ceremony arranged specially for him, at which Thailand and Cambodia will sign some kind of peace accord.Differences between the two countries over their border remain unresolved, but, under pressure to come up with something, they have made progress in agreeing to demilitarise the border.Neither can afford to disappoint President Trump. Back in July, when they were still bombing and shelling each other, his threat to end tariff talks forced them into an immediate ceasefire.Other Asean member states will hope for Trump's mere presence, brief though it is, to normalise relations with the US.They have had a tumultuous year in which their export-dependent economies were badly shaken by his tariff war. Exports from the region to the US have doubled since Trump's last visit to the Asean summit in 2017.Once Trump leaves, the other leaders can settle down to normal business – the quiet, incremental diplomacy which advances the plodding progress of integration among them.Also on the agenda is a conflict that doesn't have Trump's attention - the civil war in Myanmar, which has haunted every Asean gathering since it was triggered by a brutal coup in 2021.By Suranjana Tewari, Asia business correspondentAsia's manufacturing powerhouses, which make up much of the world's output, will be looking for respite from Trump's tariffs.Some have agreed deals, while others are still stuck in talks – but none have signed an agreement.So ink on paper, or at least promising talks, would be welcome.Take China. The meeting between Trump and Xi signals progress, but the two leaders have a lot to unpick, from levies and export controls, to the source of it all: rivalry between the world's two biggest economies as they compete for an edge in AI and advanced tech.Any ease in those tensions would bring relief to other countries in the region who have been caught in the middle. South East Asia may be the most trapped – it is deeply woven into US supply chains in electronics, for example, yet heavily reliant on Chinese demand.Exports to the US have doubled over the past decade, but tariffs of 10% to 40% would pummel manufacturers in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.It could also hurt US chipmakers like Micron Technology, which operates plants in Malaysia. The country exported around $10bn worth of semiconductors to the US last year, roughly a fifth of total US chip imports.Wealthy economies like Japan and South Korea face a different dilemma.Although close allies of the US, they are in for an unpredictable time – and will want to lock in tariff terms and investments. Automakers in both countries, which see the US as a key market, are already struggling to navigate the chaos.By Shaimaa Khalil, Japan correspondentTrump has described Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, as a woman with great \"strength and wisdom\".This week, her ability to forge a stable, working relationship with him will be an early test of her leadership - and of Japan's place in a shifting world order.In her first speech in parliament, she pledged to raise Japan's defence budget, signalling her intent to shoulder more of the security burden with Washington.Trump has spoken of this before and is expected to press Tokyo to contribute more to US troop deployments - Japan hosts the largest number of American forces abroad, about 53,000 personnel.Both sides also want to finalise a tariff deal negotiated by her predecessor.Particularly beneficial to Japan's auto giants - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - it cuts US import duties on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, potentially making them more competitive against Chinese rivals.By retaining Ryosei Akazawa as chief tariff negotiator, Takaichi is betting on continuity.In return, Japan has pledged to invest $550bn in the US to strengthen supply chains in pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.Trump has also said Japan will increase purchases of US farm products, including rice, a move welcomed in Washington but unsettling for Japanese farmers.Takaichi's ties to the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who shared a close rapport with Trump, could also work in her favour.Abe famously used rounds of golf at Mar-a-Lago to earn Trump's trust – it's the kind of personal diplomacy Takaichi may seek to emulate.By Jake Kwon, Seoul correspondentFor South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the pressing issue is Trump's tariffs.But that thunder was briefly stolen by rampant speculation that Trump might visit the border to see North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Back in August, Lee dedicated most of his time in the Oval Office to flatter Trump as a \"peacemaker\". Trump responded with enthusiasm to the prospect of sitting down with Kim, who he hasn't seen since 2019. Kim said last month that he still remembers Trump \"fondly\".Analysts believe Kim is hoping to legitimise his nuclear weapons programme with another summit with the US president. There is no indication that a meeting is in the works.Either way, Lee has a trade deal to negotiate. Talks to lower US duties on South Korean exports from 25% to 15% have stalled, despite multiple trips by Seoul officials to Washington. The sticking point is Trump's insistence that Seoul invest $350bn upfront in the US – roughly a fifth of South Korea's economy, such a huge investment could create a financial crisis, Seoul fears.But in recent days, Korean officials have voiced hope, speaking of tangible progress. And they will be hoping for a signed deal by the end of Wednesday's summit between Trump and Lee.The former vice-president tells the BBC she is not sure whether it was “grace or recklessness” that stopped her speaking up.The man is a US citizen and a Trump supporter, the president said, but declined to identify him.Saying that airing the advert was a hostile act, Trump announces an additional 10% on top of his existing levies.Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy.

In his case it was a young boy, through the rubble and smoke.\"I was reassuring him all the way that everything was fine, there was nothing to worry about,\" he explained.\"When we came out of the building, there was a car on fire. Our boys were putting it out. And, you know, I was surprised the kid didn't cry. There was certainly fear in his eyes.\"\"I said to him, go ahead and hold me as tight as you like. I'm quite big myself and, as you can see in the photo, he grabbed me so tightly.\"In the end, he had fulfilled two roles: the rescue work and his day job too. His press officer's helmet-camera rolled throughout, capturing many of the up-close photographs and videos that have since been beamed around the world.The children were carried to an emergency reception point in a safe zone, a few hundred metres from the nursery school.All were unharmed, but there can be little doubt about the danger they faced.One adult working nearby was killed in the strike and nine others were wounded, one with serious burns and another a traumatic amputation of her leg.For all the rescuers, Fedir told me, there was the constant awareness not only of the risks of fire, falling masonry and smoke, but of the possibility of another strike.Russia has been known to hit the same target twice, which Ukrainians see as a deliberate strategy to kill emergency workers.The day after the nursery school attack, one of these so called \"double taps\" killed a firefighter and wounded five of his colleagues in a village a short distance from Kharkiv.Ukraine believes Russia has turned to civilian targets in desperation over its inability to make significant gains on the battlefield.Both Oleksandr and Fedir say what they saw at the kindergarten has done little to change their view of the enemy.\"From the beginning I have only one feeling that we must go through all this and win,\" Oleksandr told me.I ask him what kind of future he envisages for the 48 young lives he helped save.\"Of course, only good, happy lives,\" he replied. \"But not only our children. I would like all children to live in peace.\"A \"coalition of the willing\" meeting in London seeks to increase pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine.The three men, aged 48, 45, and 44, were arrested at addresses in west and central London.People are packing Christmas boxes for children in Ukraine and Moldova.The prime minister is hosting Zelensky and the \"coalition of the willing\" at Downing Street on Friday.John Healey says the UK is hunting Russian submarines as BBC News joins him on board a new RAF aircraft.Copyright 2025 BBC.

We meet the experts on the front line of climate change who explore new strategies to mitigate and adapt.The European Union is rushing to find ways to prop up Ukraine's finances as the war shows no end in sight and the costs mount.The urgency has escalated as the Trump administration made it clear it will be up to Europe to foot the bill for the continent's security.With the US receding, Europeans are now contemplating an audacious plan to use Russia's immobilised assets to issue a €140 billion reparations loan to Ukraine, which could help cover the country's financial and military needs for 2026 and 2027.The plan, however, is facing obstacles.Belgium, which hosts the assets, hit the brakes on it during an EU summit this week, citing its legal ramifications as well as the threat of retaliation from Russia. Still, Europeans are clear they – and their taxpayers – do not want to pay for the destruction caused by Russia, so there is little alternative.They agree on the what – now they need a how.Here's what you should know about the reparations loan.In the first week of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the EU, together with its G7 allies, applied unprecedented sanctions on the Kremlin.Among those was a sweeping decision to immobilise the assets of the Russian Central Bank held in the West to quash Moscow's ability to finance the war.For the EU, this represented €210 billion in economic and political leverage over Russia, as the bulk of the assets are held at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels. The assets at Euroclear generate annual windfall profits of €2.5 billion to €3 billion for the Belgian government, which homes Euroclear, and it is now at the centre of talks.Last year, after months of internal debate, the EU began using the extraordinary revenues to support Ukraine's financial and military needs. The efforts then coalesced into a larger G7 loan of €45 billion, to be repaid entirely from the windfall profits.With Russia showing no willingness to engage in meaningful peace talks, Europeans have realised the G7 line of credit will soon prove insufficient.Something bigger needs to be done.The urgency to find a solution prompted the European Commission to take a closer look at Euroclear. The assets, initially held as bonds, have matured into a cash pool worth about €175 billion, with an additional €10 billion expected in the near future.Under the tentative plan, Euroclear would transfer the cash to the Commission, which would then issue a €140 billion loan to Ukraine on behalf of the union. The remaining €45 billion would cover the G7 credit, as the windfall profits would no longer apply.The €140 billion loan would then be disbursed in gradual tranches to Kyiv and be subject to certain conditions. For instance, a Made-in-Europe target for purchased weapons.Ukraine would be asked to repay the loan only after Russia ends its war of aggression and agrees to compensate for the damages caused. Hence, the name 'reparations loan'. After that, the Commission would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay Russia, completing the circle. The Commission insists this is not confiscation.Politically, the loan is useful too, as it would provide a reliable, steady line of support to Kyiv while sparing cash-strapped member states from paying out of pocket.The plan, which is still in early stages, has pushed Belgium to the fore of the political debate as the home of Euroclear, where the assets are held.Belgium has a long-standing investment treaty with Russia that provides for arbitration in the event of any dispute between the parties. Belgium fears that, the very moment the cash leaves Euroclear, Moscow will launch aggressive retaliation to recover the €140 billion and demand hefty compensation, leading to international litigation.Another critical concern is that EU sanctions, which require unanimity, might be lifted before Moscow pays reparations and therefore unwind the entire loan.This is why Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has insisted on the need to secure the \"full mutualisation\" of risks and bulletproof guarantees from all member states.In theory, each member state would back a share of the €140 billion in proportion to its size. The EU budget could be mobilised later as an additional layer of support.\"If you take the money from my country, if it goes wrong, I am not able, and certainly not willing, in a week's time to pay €140 billion,\" De Wever said after an EU summit on Thursday that concluded without a firm agreement on the idea.\"So I would imagine that everybody who is really for this decision, really wants to make this happen, is also ready, willing and able to make a guarantee so that I can sleep quietly at night knowing that if it goes wrong or sour that the solidarity will make (sure) that the money is actually there,\" he added.\"This question was not answered with a tsunami of enthusiasm around the table.\"The reparations loan has also cast a light on the European Central Bank, the chief guarantor of financial and monetary stability in the eurozone.Its president, Christine Lagarde, had previously criticised any move that could be seen as outright confiscation of a country's sovereign assets, which is illegal under international law and could damage the international reputation of the euro jurisdiction. In its current format, the loan falls short of outright confiscation because Russia would be able to recover the assets if it agreed to pay reparations, which is virtually impossible.According to diplomats and officials familiar with the discussions, Lagarde did not oppose the plan and suggested the idea of a reparations loan is feasible, but further technical work is needed. Lagarde recommended the EU should not move forward alone with the unprecedented project and instead bring in other G7 allies, like the UK, Canada and Japan, all of which hold smaller portions of Russian sovereign assets.De Wever has demanded total transparency to locate all the assets around Europe.\"The fattest chicken is in Belgium, but there are other chickens around. In the eurozone, there are other countries with immobilised assets: there are six,\" he said.\"None of them has ever given any transparency on how much money they have. No transparency on the windfall profits of that money, no transparency on the tax income of that money,\" he added, without naming the countries.The Commission, though, has based the plan exclusively on the €185 billion kept at Euroclear, despite previously saying that about €210 billion was held in the bloc.Publicly, EU member states have expressed understanding and sympathy for Belgium.\"I would use the same argument if the assets were in Germany. Today we took a step forward that should not be taken for granted,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said at the end of the summit. \"We will do what we can to move forward.\"Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said that all member states \"must bear a shared risk, not just Belgium on its own\". (Hungary has already said it would not participate.)Privately, diplomats say there is a limit to how much Belgium can expect.The idea of compensating Belgian companies that still operate in Russia if the Kremlin decided to retaliate by seizing their assets in return is considered a no-go.Austria's recent attempt to offset Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI), which runs a successful subsidiary in Russia, for a €2.1 billion legal defeat proved controversialand failed to gather support from the rest of the member states.There is also the politics of it, too.De Wever is stuck in fraught budget talks, and his multi-party coalition is facing a delicate balancing act. This has raised the question of whether the prime minister may not be as concerned as he makes it seem to the press, but is looking to capitalise on playing tough to earn domestic points.After all, in Brussels, each leader speaks to two audiences: his European counterparts and his voters. For a breakthrough to happen, it has to look difficult.Leaders have instructed the European Commission to explore \"options\" to address Kyiv's ballooning financial and military needs over the next two to three years.That language leaves the door open to alternatives.One avenue is for member states to go to the markets and raise the funds themselves without touching the Russian assets. This was done in 2023 when the Ukraine Facility was set up, assuring €50 billion to Kyiv in grants and loans.Although the Belgian premier did not rule out that possibility when asked by reporters, it would be difficult for other heavily indebted European countries to go down that path.If the underwriting is done based on size, nations like France and Italy would be on the line. This poses a problem for President Emmanuel Macron, who is dealing with complicated budget talks, but also for Giorgia Meloni, given her country's debt pile.\"Tonight's discussion did not bury the proposal made by the Commission. It simply provided an opportunity to raise technical issues that need to be resolved. And we are aware of these technical issues,\" Macron said.The ball is now in the Commission's court. The executive, which came under fire for the way it presented the file without much consultation, is expected to intensify bilateral contacts with Belgium and placate all outstanding concerns.\"There are points to be clarified and have a deep dive,\" said Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, signalling a determination to march ahead.\"In other words, we agreed on the what, that is, the Reparations Loan, and we have to work on the how, how we make it possible (and) what's the best option to move forward.\"An updated proposal should be presented before the next summit in December, which is now seen by diplomats as crunch time for a decision to be made before the new year.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told European leaders that Ukraine would need the cash in 2026, preferably at the \"very beginning of the year\".\"I don't know if it's possible,\" he admitted. \"Not everything depends on us. It's a political decision.\"Browse today's tags","headline":"What is the reparations loan for Ukraine and why is the EU stuck?","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/10/25/what-is-the-reparations-loan-for-ukraine-and-why-is-the-eu-stuck-with-the-plan","message":""},{"details":"Radio SchumanThis is Radio Schuman, your new go-to podcast to spice up your weekday mornings with relevant news, insights, and behind-the-scenes from Brussels and beyond.Brussels, My Love?From the economy to the climate and the EU's role in world affairs, this talk show sheds light on European affairs and the issues that impact on our daily lives as Europeans.

The Asian giant had likely done so in response to trade tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, but von der Leyen pointed out the impact it would have on Europe.\"If you consider that over 90% of our consumption of rare earth magnets come from imports from China, you see the risks here for Europe and its most strategic industrial sectors,\" von der Leyen said at a conference in Berlin.These minerals are key for EU industries, such as the automotive, defence, Greentech and digital sectors.Von der Leyen said that in the short term, the EU would focus on finding solutions with its Chinese counterparts, but that it would also ramp up its efforts to coordinate with other countries to secure access to alternative sources of the minerals.\"The aim is to secure access to alternative sources of critical raw materials in the short, medium and long term for our European industries,\" von der Leyen said, \"We will speed up work on critical raw materials partnerships with countries like Ukraine and Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Chile and Greenland\".The European Commission chief said the new scheme, named RESourceEU, takes after REPowerEU, an intiative launched after Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the aim of strengthening the EU's independence in the energy sector, away from Russian energy sources.\"It starts with a circular economy, not for environmental reasons, but to exploit the critical raw materials already contained in products sold in Europe,\" von der Leyen said\"In addition, we will focus on everything, from joint purchasing to stockpiling. We will boost investment and strategic projects for the production and processing of critical raw materials here in the European Union,\" she added.Browse today's tags","headline":"EU seeks to end dependency on China for rare earths","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/10/25/european-union-seeks-to-end-dependency-on-china-for-rare-earths","message":""},{"details":"Radio SchumanThis is Radio Schuman, your new go-to podcast to spice up your weekday mornings with relevant news, insights, and behind-the-scenes from Brussels and beyond.Brussels, My Love?From the economy to the climate and the EU's role in world affairs, this talk show sheds light on European affairs and the issues that impact on our daily lives as Europeans.

Higgins, who has been serving as the president of Ireland since 2011.The majority of left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, the Greens and the Social Democrats, had expressed support for the left-wing frontrunner, who has been an independent lawmaker since 2016.Connolly, 68, is a fluent Irish speaker from Galway in the west of Ireland, and has promised to be a voice for all the people of Ireland and for peace.The former barrister has been a strong critic of both the European Union and the United States, and denounced the EU's plans to ramp up military spending. She has also been an outspoken critic of Israel over its offensive in Gaza. Connolly gained support among young voters after she blamed government policy for the housing crisis.Professor of EU law Tobias Lock from the university of Maynooth tells Euronews the incoming President will not impact the relationship between Dublin and Brussels.\"She won't be involved in day to day politics obviously, it is not part of her role and she won't be involved in the Irish presidency of the EU either,\" he said. \"Connelly voted against the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 but insists she is pro European, but wants a different Europe, a more social Europe,\" adds Lock. The German native found the whole campaign rather strange as candidates were asked about issues they have no influence over, from housing to defence.Initially three candidates were in the running to become the country's tenth president. However, Jim Gavin, the candidate for Prime Minister Micheál Martin’s Fianna Fáil's party, pulled out from the race over a financial dispute dating back to 2009. Despite his withdrawal, Gavin's name remained on the ballot paper.Irish presidents represent the country on a world stage, host visiting heads of state and hold specific constitutional powers, the role is largely ceremonial as they do not hold power to shape laws or policies.Browse today's tags","headline":"Leftwing Catherine Connolly wins Ireland presidential election","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/10/25/leftwing-catherine-connolly-wins-ireland-presidential-election","message":""},{"details":"US President Donald Trump has presided over a \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, who have a long-standing border dispute, which he calls \"historic\"After the ceremony, Thailand's foreign minister refused to call it a peace agreement, telling the BBC \"I would call it a pathway to peace\" insteadTrump calls the agreement \"a monumental step\". But looking at the details, it isn't much of leap forward, the BBC's South East Asia correspondent writesTrade pressure from Trump led to a ceasefire in late July, ending five days of clashes that killed over two dozen peopleThe US president is on a one-week trip to Asia that will include meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of Apec in South Korea and a stop in Japan to meet the country's newly elected first female leaderWatch: Trump lands in Malaysia for signing of Thailand-Cambodia 'peace deal'Edited by Jack Burgess, with Jonathan Head and Tessa Wong reporting from Kuala LumpurAdam GoldsmithLive reporterUS President Trump declared today that he had presided over the signing of a \"historic\" peace deal between Thailand and Cambodia.But as our South East Asia correspondent writes, historic differences between the two countries remain despite Donald Trump's superlatives.Thailand's foreign minister even refused to call it a peace agreement, preferring instead to term it \"a pathway to peace\".We've got a full rundown on what was said on all sides, as Trump told reporters making peace deals is a \"hobby\" while gathering praise from the Cambodian prime minister for his \"decisive leadership\".For Trump, trade deals have become a useful diplomatic tool to pressure countries into peace deals, our reporter at the summit writes.And, while Trump presided over the so-called \"peace deal\" signing ceremony, his trade representatives have been gearing up for business talks with China's Xi Jinping next week. They told reporters that the \"final details\" of a trade deal have been thrashed out.Before that, the US president will fly to Tokyo for the next phase of his diplomatic tour around South East Asia - here's a look ahead to the rest of his itinerary.That brings our live coverage to a close, but you can find further details in our latest news story.This live page was written by Tessa Wong in Kuala Lumpur, with Adam Goldsmith and Nabiha Ahmed in London. It was edited by Emily McGarvey and Jack Burgess.Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia CorrespondentAfter the ceremony, the Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement, sticking instead to their own preferred title 'Joint Declaration by the Prime Ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur', which doesn’t exactly trip off the tongue.“I would call it a pathway to peace,” was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump’s expansive claims for it.Cambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand, referring it to the International Court of Justice, something Thailand does not agree with.At the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president, reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was more circumspect, mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia.Thailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation. It says it \"appreciates\" President Trump’s support, and describes the US and Malaysia only as \"facilitating\" this agreement.Nabiha AhmedLive reporterUS President Donald Trump will be continuing his trip to Asia with visits to other countries over the next few days.Here's how his diary's shaping up:Trump will then wrap up his Asia trip and fly back to the United States.Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia CorrespondentIt was, as everyone knew it would be, all about President Trump.He literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech, and made the biggest claims.It was all superlatives. “This is a momentous day for South East Asia,” said the US president. “A monumental step”.But what does the ‘Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord’, as President Trump has renamed it, actually amount to?Remember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July. That too was helped, or at least accelerated, by pressure from Trump. Looking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn’t much of leap forward.The two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.They have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint task force to address the proliferation of scam centres. They will replace missing border markers with temporary ones.This is progress, and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel President Trump’s involvement may help these agreements stick. But the historic differences over the border remain unresolved, and at risk of flaring up again.If you're just joining us, or are in need of a quick summary, we've just seen the leaders of Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and the US hold a news conference for the signing of what Trump has declared the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\".Here's a recap of the key moments:US President Donald Trump:Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Foreign Minister:Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet:Watch: Trump oversees signing of 'historic' Thailand-Cambodia 'peace deal'If you missed the moment the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\" were signed, we've put together a wrap of some of the key moments from the press conference.We are going through the exact details of the agreement, so stay with us as we bring you the latest updates.Tessa Wongat the Asean Summit in Kuala LumpurAt the Thailand foreign minister's press conference, I asked what Thailand was calling the agreement they just signed, given that President Trump has called it the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\".Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow insisted that the agreement still bears the name the Thais announced yesterday, which was a \"joint declaration\" of the outcomes of a Thai-Cambodia meeting.When I pressed him again, asking if we could call it a peace deal, he then said \"I would call it a pathway to peace\".In answer to earlier questions about the US involvement, the foreign minister said they and the Malaysians \"facilitated\",  but in the end the discussions were only between Thailand and Cambodia.Tessa Wongat the Asean Summit in Kuala LumpurWhen Thailand and Cambodia ended hostilities back in July, that ceasefire came shortly after Trump warned that their war would endanger their respective trade deals and tariff negotiations with the US.With today's signing coupled with Trump's announcement of a US trade deal with Cambodia and a minerals agreement with Thailand, he has made it very clear that his administration will be using US trade deals as a key way to diplomatically pressure countries to make peace.\"We do transactions, lots of them, with both nations as long as they live in peace,\" Trump said.\"And I really feel that when we make deals, we see two countries that we do a lot of business with... we have to use that business to make sure they don't get into wars.\"Following the joint Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire agreement, trade agreements between the US and Thailand and Cambodia respectively have now been handed out to sign.Trump could be heard saying that the agreements were \"a great deal for both countries\" as he signed them.Just before the ceasefire deal was signed, the Cambodian PM Hun Manet thanked US President Donald Trump for his \"decisive lead\" and \"tireless efforts\" to make the peace accords a reality.\"No matter how difficult and complex a dispute may be, they must be resolved by peaceful means,\" he said.Manet also thanked the Malaysian PM for his assistance in the agreement, and said he looked forward to continued support and contribution from the international community in the joint declaration.The Thai PM also thanked Trump for his efforts in the ceasefire, and acknowledged his condolences in regards to the death of Thailand's Queen Mother.He said that the removal of weaponry, and the freeing of prisoners of war would begin \"promptly\", adding that the declaration would provide \"the building blocks for lasting peace\" if fully implemented.Tessa Wongat the Asean Summit in Kuala LumpurDespite the Thais insisting in press briefings that they are signing a \"joint declaration of Thailand and Cambodia relationship\", and that they are not calling it a peace deal, it is clear that Trump and perhaps even Malaysia have other ideas.In his opening remarks, Trump said they were signing the \"Kuala Lumpur  Peace Accords\".Meanwhile the backdrop onstage put up by the Malaysians states \"Delivering Peace: Cambodia-Thailand Peace Deal\".Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet have just signed a joint \"peace deal\", overseen by US President Donald Trump.Everyone is waiting to hear further details on the agreement, but officials have already outlined a few of the details, which we told you about earlier today.Trump says there have been \"a lot of phone calls between the four of us\" following the \"bloodshed\" between Thailand and Cambodia in July, but says his administration \"got it stopped\".As a reminder, back in July, the Thailand-Cambodia border war ended with an “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” after days of fighting.The US president says he is very good at getting peace deals done, arguing he is far better at it than the United Nations.Trump begins by offering his condolences to Thailand following the death of Queen Sirikit, the mother of Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn.He then thanks the Malaysian prime minister for his role in what Trump calls the \"historic\" agreement between the \"courageous\" leaders of Thailand and Cambodia.He adds that the deal could save \"millions of lives\".US President Donald Trump is speaking in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the signing of what he's called a \"great peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia.Stay with us as we keep you across the latest updates from the signing ceremony.Suranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentSouth East Asia's major economies are export-reliant.US trade policy, particularly around tariffs on semiconductors and electronics, leave many manufacturing hubs like Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore vulnerable.They trade heavily with both the US and China, and so are vulnerable to tensions between the world's two biggest economies too.Indonesia's trade negotiator Airlangga Hartarto told the BBC earlier this month that he expects the country's deal with the US to be inked by the end of October.Malaysia - which exported around $10bn worth of semiconductors to the US last year - could also be close to concluding its deal, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim telling reporters last week that 99.9% of issues have been resolved.Tessa Wongat the Asean Summit in Kuala LumpurWe haven’t yet seen a copy of the actual agreement. But some information has already been outlined by officials who arrived here last week to hash out the details. Both countries have agreed to:Cambodia has also said the agreement will pave the way for the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers detained by Thailand.There may be more details revealed at the signing ceremony soon - we’ll keep you posted.Anti-Trump demonstrations have been seen in Kuala Lumpur, with some protesters holding signs saying the president is not welcome in Malaysia.Trump's five-day diplomatic tour of Asia will see him visit Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, with trade at the top of the agenda. As our reporter Tess Wong explains in an earlier post, many in Muslim-majority Malaysia have been critical about US support for Israel in the Israel-Gaza war.Trade talks between the US and China have progressed to the point where Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping can have a \"very productive meeting\" when they meet later this week, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer says.Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Greer says: \"I think we're moving forward to the final details of the type of agreement that the leaders can review and decide if they want to conclude together.\"Greer says that extending the truce on trade measures has been discussed at the talks, which have been ongoing since Saturday.Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to meet on Thursday in South Korea, at the end of the president's five-day Asia trip.Suranjana TewariAsia business correspondentEconomies in Asia will be looking to stabilise relations with the US, after months of tariff disputes.Trump's trade war has upended trade across the region's closely knit supply chains, with exporters unable to plan their operations amid the uncertainty.South East Asia is a valuable market for the US, and ties with the Asean grouping are of strategic importance in the face of an increasingly assertive China.Many American companies also now manufacture in the region after moving out of China.The United States is also a top export destination for countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia.So they will be looking at any trade deals inked in Malaysia for clues on what their agreements might look like.Copyright © 2025 BBC.

But I hope it holds for Hamas, too, because they gave us their word on something,” he said.Trump also suggested that Qatari troops and those of other countries may be part of the so-called “international stabilisation force” for Gaza.“We have 59 countries. We have a lot of countries that are signed on,” he said. “This should be an enduring peace.”The security force for Gaza could be in place “pretty quickly”, he added. “They are actually picking leaders right now.”The Qatari government, in a readout of the talks on Air Force One, shared by the Qatar News Agency, said the leaders discussed a range of issues, including efforts related to “supporting peace in the region, consolidating the agreement to end the war in Gaza, and ensuring the parties’ implementation of all its provisions”.Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from the Qatari capital, Doha, said the meeting comes amid pressure from Israel and the US on Hamas to release the bodies of all the remaining Israelis taken captive during the attacks of October 7, 2023.“That has been a point of contention, [with] Israel saying that Hamas has not in the past four days returned any of those bodies,” she said.“Hamas, for its part, has said it needs more time to access areas that have been out of reach as a result of the war and the heavy bombardment that has come down on the Strip.”Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out deadly strikes across Gaza and restrict deliveries of humanitarian aid to Palestinians across the territory, putting further strain on the shaky ceasefire.Israeli forces killed at least one person and wounded four others in an attack on a vehicle in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, with the Israeli military claiming it was targeting a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad who had been planning to attack Israeli troops.Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, described the attack as a “breach of an already fragile ceasefire”.“This is not the first time we are seeing a violation of the ceasefire. Over the past two weeks, there has been 88 violations involving the killing of displaced families trying to get back to their homes behind what the Israeli military describes as the ‘yellow line’ – an imaginary line that seeks to redraw the map of Gaza and which eats up the majority of the territory’s agricultural land,” Mahmoud said.Despite the Israeli violations, US officials have sought to project a positive message, telling reporters this week that the deal was progressing well despite more work needing to be done.Speaking to reporters separately on Saturday, Rubio said that American officials would get input on a possible United Nations resolution or international agreement to authorise the multinational force in Gaza.The US state secretary added that he would discuss the issue in Qatar on Sunday.“Many of the countries that have expressed an interest in participating at some level – whether it be monetary or personnel or both – are going to need that [a UN resolution or international agreement], because their domestic laws require it,” Rubio said.“So we have a whole team working on that outline of it.”According to Al Jazeera’s Jabbari in Doha, the message from the Trump administration on Saturday was that Qatar has a key role to play as the negotiations progress.“The United States president has highlighted that, without their mediating efforts, this ceasefire would not have been possible in the first place,” she said.“And of course, moving forward, in order to advance from one stage to the next, it has to be with the input and consultation of the Qataris.”Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Trump thanks Qatar for mediation efforts as talks on Gaza plan continue","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/trump-thanks-qatar-for-mediation-efforts-as-talks-on-gaza-plan-continue","message":""},{"details":"Independent left-wing politician Catherine Connolly has been elected Ireland's 10th president after a landslide victory over her rival Heather Humphreys.A seasoned politician and political performer, Connolly has been a TD (member of parliament) since 2016 for the Galway West constituency and also served as the Dail (Irish parliament) deputy speaker.Connolly had the support of Ireland's major left-wing opposition parties, including Sinn Féin, the Irish Labour Party and the Social Democrats.Seen very much as an anti-establishment candidate, in recent weeks the 68-year-old began insisting her campaign was a \"movement\".She had been eyeing the presidency for a number of years and was the first candidate to announce she would run back in July.To get on the ballot, a candidate must have the backing of 20 members of parliament or the backing of four city or county councils.She already had more than the required 20 parliamentarian signatures even without the backing of Ireland's main opposition party Sinn Féin, whose campaigning machine weighed in behind her around halfway through.She had only two competitors - Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys and Fianna Fail's Jim Gavin, candidates put forward by the two major parties in government.Mr Gavin withdrew from the campaign earlier this month, but remained on the ballot securing 7.2% of the total poll in the end.Connolly's composed debating style as well as a slick social media campaign garnered much praise and attention, particularly from younger voters.She had a viral moment with a social media video of her doing keepie uppies with a football and taking on young people on the basketball court. Her impressive athletic attributes were viewed hundreds of thousands of times online.Her main rival Humphreys failed to generate the same positive attention.The biggest points of scrutiny levelled at Connolly throughout the campaign focused on her views on foreign policy and the Israel/Hamas conflict.Connolly is an outspoken supporter of Palestine and frequently speaks about the \"genocide\" in Gaza and criticises \"atrocities\" committed by Israel.Ireland is viewed internationally as being one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe and Irish government ministers are often criticised as being antisemetic by Israeli politicians.She sparked debate when she told BBC News NI during the campaign that Hamas was \"part of the fabric\" of Palestinian people.Connolly has also been a critic of Nato and Fine Gael have hit out at her during the campaign for not being critical enough of Russia.The head of state role in Ireland is mostly a ceremonial role and it is not executive. The president and the government are separate so they have no say in government policies.Current president Michael D Higgins has often privately irked Irish ministers during his 14-year tenure by what has been perceived as criticism of government policy. He has been outspoken on Ireland's housing crisis and is also supportive of Palestine.Connolly and Higgins have a history. Even though Connolly previously served as an Irish Labour councillor, she left the party after they did not add her as a running mate alongside Higgins on the Galway ticket.Sinn Féin leader and opposition leader Mary Lou McDonald told BBC NI she believed Connolly would make the role her own.\"Catherine brings her authentic self to this role and I am not convinced that you ever have an Uachtarain [Irish president] that is simply a heat and repeat of a previous Uachtarain,\" she said at Dublin Castle.Even though she is a Palestinian supporter and previously criticised the US and UK governments' roles in the conflict, Connolly told a TV debate last week she would not refuse to meet figures such as US President Donald Trump.\"If it's just a meet and greet, then I will meet and greet. If the discussion is genocide, then that's a completely different thing. But I doubt that will be the discussion with the president,\" she told the debate.Connolly sought out to establish herself as a United Ireland candidate and said she would like to see it during her presidency, which runs for seven years.She travelled to Northern Ireland during her campaign and her support of a United Ireland is believed to be one of the reasons she received Sinn Féin backing.McDonald said Connolly appreciated \"the preparation\" for a United Ireland \"needs to happen now\" and that she would \"exercise that soft power\".\"This is an exciting time,\" she added.\"She's the right woman in the right place at the right time.\"During the campaign, Connolly vowed to return a part of her presidential salary - which comes in at around €350,000 (£305,000).Connolly said she would give back a \"substantial\" portion of the salary to projects.Speaking after her win at Dublin Castle she vowed to be an \"inclusive\" president for all stating the Irish people can \"shape a new Republic\".\"I will be a president who listens and reflects and who speaks when it's necessary,\" she said.\"I will be a voice for peace, a voice that builds on our policy of neutrality, a voice that articulates the existential threat posed by climate change, and a voice that recognises the tremendous work being done the length and breadth of the country.\"Copyright 2025 BBC.

They used a basket lift to access a balcony leading to the Apollo Gallery, forced open a window and broke display cases to steal the jewels, before escaping on two-wheelers. The robbery lasted between six to seven minutes.A Paris prosecutor estimates that the jewels stolen from the Louvre last week were worth 88 million euros, but that the monetary estimate doesn’t include their historical value to France.The heist sparked public outrage and has been criticised as a \"national humiliation\" by several French lawmakers. It also raised questions over museum security, for which officials at the Louvre had previously warned that there was a lack of investment.However, in recent years, Europe has seen a noticeable surge in museum heists. In France alone, at least four museums have been robbed in the past few months.Browse today's tags","headline":"The Louvre transfers part of jewellery collection to underground vault","level":"info","link":"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/10/25/the-louvre-secretly-transfers-part-of-jewellery-collection-to-underground-bank-of-france-v","message":""},{"details":"A Turkish charity owner at the centre of sexual abuse allegations, brought to light by a BBC investigation, has been arrested.BBC News Turkish revealed accusations that Sadettin Karagoz sexually exploited vulnerable women, promising them aid in return for sex. He denies all the allegations.Mr Karagoz set up his charity in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in 2014. Syrian refugees desperate for help said at first he seemed like \"an angel\".One of them, Madina, fled the Syrian civil war in 2016 and said that two years later, one of her children became critically ill and her husband abandoned her. Her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.Left to care for three children alone, she went to Sadettin Karagoz's organisation, which translates as the Hope Charity Store. It gathers donations for refugees such as nappies, pasta, milk and clothes.\"He told me: 'When you have nowhere to go, come to me and I will look after you,\" she says.But when she did, Madina says he changed. She describes how Mr Karagoz told her to go with him to an area in the office behind a curtain to get some supplies.\"He grabbed me,\" she says. \"He started kissing me… I told him to get away from me. If I hadn't yelled, he would have tried to rape me.\"Madina describes how she escaped from the building but Mr Karagoz later went to her home.\"I didn't open the door because I was terrified,\" she says, explaining that he threatened to have her sent back to Syria.Scared of repercussions, Madina says she never went to the police and did not tell anyone else what had happened.Mr Karagoz, a retired bank worker, denies the allegations and has told the BBC that his organisation has helped more than 37,000 people.He says that the aid distribution area in the charity is small, crowded and monitored by CCTV so he could not have been alone with any woman.Over the years, his charity has gained widespread recognition and won a local newspaper award in 2020. It has been featured on national TV, and he says it has attracted support from national and international organisations. In March this year he changed its Turkish name to My Home-meal Association.In all, three women, including Madina, told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had sexually assaulted and harassed them.Seven other people, including two former employees of his charity, say they either witnessed or heard first-hand testimony of him committing acts of sexual abuse between 2016 and 2024.According to 27-year-old Syrian refugee Nada, he said he would only give her aid if she went to an empty flat with him. \"If you don't, I won't give you anything,\" she says Mr Karagoz told her. Again, her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.She was with her sister-in-law and says they stormed out. But desperate to provide for her family, she explains she didn't know where else to turn, so went back.On one occasion, Nada says Mr Karagoz took her behind a curtain to get nappies for her son where \"he tried to touch my breasts\".Another time, she says that \"he came from behind and grabbed my hand… he forced me to touch his genitals\".Afraid of the stigma attached to sexual abuse and scared she would be blamed, Nada says she didn't feel she could tell anyone, even her husband.The third woman who told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had assaulted her is Batoul, who has since moved to Germany.A single mother, she too says she went to him for help. \"When I turned away to pick up the aid, he put his hands on my backside,\" she explains. \"I left the aid and walked out of the shop.\"These testimonies were not the first to surface against Mr Karagoz.In 2019 and 2025 he was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but on both occasions prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Police said neither victims nor witnesses were willing to come forward to make formal complaints.Some women told us they were afraid testifying could lead to them being harassed or deported.But after the BBC investigation, it is understood two other women came forward to report Mr Karagoz, and their testimony resulted in him being charged with sexual abuse. He is now in jail awaiting trial.Batoul says she is \"truly happy\" he has been arrested, \"for myself and for all the women who have suffered in silence and couldn't speak out because of fear\".She adds that she hopes it \"gives courage and strength to all women who are being exploited in any way\".Before he was arrested, we put the allegations made by Madina, Nada, Batoul and charity workers to Mr Karagoz.He denied all the accusations and claimed if they were true, more women would have come forward.\"Three people, five people, 10 people [could complain]. Such things occur,\" he said. \"If you said 100, 200 [had accused me], then fine, then you could believe I actually did those things.\"He also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and showed us a medical report with details of an operation in 2016 to remove his left testicle. This meant he was not able to perform any sexual activity, he said.However a professor of urology and specialist in men's sexual health, Ates Kadioglu, told the BBC that having one testicle removed \"doesn't affect someone's sex life\".We put this to Mr Karagoz who insisted that sexual activity was \"not possible for me\".We also put it to him that sexual assault may be motivated by a desire for power and control. He responded by saying: \"I personally don't have such an urge.\"\"All we did was good deeds and this is what we get in return.\"Sadettin Karagoz said women who accused him of assault in the past did so because he had reported them to the police for being involved in illegal activities.All the women we spoke to denied they or their relatives were involved with crime and the BBC has seen no evidence to suggest that they were.The Scottish Conservatives, who obtained the information, say taxpayers are being \"left to pick up the tab\".Two victims share their experiences as the government announces a review into tackling stalking.A BBC documentary team follows a Syrian refugee's journey back to his homeland in search of his missing children and grandchildren.Footage released by the Turkish city of Kayseri's transport operator shows the last-minute rescue.Ciprian Ilie is jailed for assisting in the murder of Cumali Turhan whose body was found in landfill.Copyright 2025 BBC.

The shift subtly disrupts our circadian rhythm, the internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, alertness, hormone production and mood.The effects of the clock change are rooted in our circadian rhythms - the body’s internal 24-hour clock that regulates sleep, alertness, hormone production, and mood.\"There’s a circadian clock in every cell of the body, but there’s also a principal clock: a group of neurons in the brain that automatically follows light, dawn, dusk, and darkness via signals from the eyes,\" Timo Partonen, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Helsinki, told Euronews Health.\"How well this clock functions affects how well we sleep and how good or bad our mood is. That’s why it’s so important,\" he added.Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of moving clocks forward by one hour in spring and back again in autumn to extend evening daylight. Most of Europe, North America, parts of Africa, and Asia follow this system.This year, clocks will go back on Sunday, 26 October.While many welcome the extra hour, the change still nudges our internal timing - and some people feel it more than others.\"Generally speaking, despite complaints about evenings getting darker, the autumn one is usually perceived as less painful,\" Professor Malcolm von Schantz, a chronobiologist at Northumbria University, told Euronews Health.\"Those who dislike the autumn change mainly complain that it’s suddenly dark when they leave work. But there are two points to that. First, it simply reflects where we live: at that time of year, there aren’t enough daylight hours to keep both mornings and evenings bright. That’s not a result of the clock change, just geography.\"Second, and less intuitively, is that biologically and physiologically, light in the morning is much more important for us,\" he said.Partonen agreed, saying that \"the autumn clock change is easier to adjust to because it gives us an extra hour to our day. It’s easier for the principal circadian clock to adapt to this new schedule\".However, he warned that initially, sleep may not feel as refreshing as during the summer months.\"There’s also the risk that people don’t use the extra hour for sleep - instead, they stay up later and continue to build sleep debt. The change could be an opportunity to catch up on rest, but most people don’t use it that way,\" he said.The springtime hour change - which steals an hour of sleep - has been linked to short-term spikes in traffic accidents, sleep loss, and heart attacks (one study cited by the American Heart Foundation found there was a 24 per cent increase in heart attacks on the day following the switch to daylight saving time).But the October shift can still have subtler effects.A 2025 study by Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Oxford found that women were more likely than men to report increased worry, confusion, and stress in the days after the clock change. Disruptions to children’s routines, such as later bedtimes and difficulty waking, also contributed to stress within households.Broader health research suggests that frequent clock changes can carry more serious, long-term risks.A recent analysis by Stanford Medicine scientists found that biannual clock shifts may lead to higher rates of stroke and obesity. The study compared three policies - permanent standard time, permanent daylight saving time, and the current biannual shifting - and concluded that seasonal time changes are the worst option.By modelling light exposure, circadian alignment, and health outcomes across the United States, the researchers estimated that adopting permanent standard time could prevent around 300,000 strokes per year and reduce obesity in 2.6 million people. Permanent daylight saving time would achieve about two-thirds of that benefit, according to the research.Maintaining a consistent sleep pattern is one of the most important - and often overlooked - aspects of our long-term health.“We know it’s important, and we also know our bodies can cope with some irregularity. But from epidemiological data, we know that for long-term health it’s better to minimise fluctuations,\" explained Schantz.He described the modern habit of catching up on sleep at weekends - known as “social jet lag” - as biologically disruptive.“Many of us get up early during the week and then sleep in on weekends - essentially shifting our schedule as if travelling to another time zone on Friday and back on Monday. That pattern has the same long-term negative effects as frequent exposure to jet lag,” he said.A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health found that individuals with irregular sleep-wake cycles had a 26 per cent higher risk of experiencing major cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, even if they obtained the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night.Many scientists and sleep organisations - including the British Sleep Society, which made an official statement on the matter last year - support ending the biannual clock changes in favour of permanent standard time.The European Union proposed ending seasonal clock changes in 2018, and while the European Parliament supported it in principle, member states couldn’t agree on whether to adopt a permanent standard time or summer time.For now, the clock continues to tick back and forth each year.Experts agree that using the extra hour for genuine rest - rather than staying up later - can help smooth the transition.“Go to sleep early enough,” advises Dr Partonen.“If the clock change happens on the night between Saturday and Sunday, go to bed at your usual time - or slightly earlier - on Saturday. That way, you can use the extra hour for sleep and reduce any sleep deprivation”.Browse today's tags","headline":"Don't forget, the clocks go back tonight!

For decades, Tomas - who lives in the small village of Nueva Oceania - had been practically a neighbour to these nomadic people, who shun contact with outsiders. However, until very recently, he had rarely seen them.The Mashco Piro have chosen to be cut off from the world for more than a century. They hunt with long bows and arrows, relying on the Amazonian rainforest for everything they need.\"They started circling and whistling, imitating animals, many different types of birds,\" Tomas recalls.\"I kept saying: 'Nomole' (brother). Then they gathered, they felt closer, so we headed toward the river and ran.\"A new report by the human rights organisation, Survival International, says there are at least 196 of what it calls \"uncontacted groups\" left in the world. The Mashco Piro is believed to be the largest. The report says half of these groups could be wiped out in the next decade if governments don't do more to protect them.It claims the biggest risks are from logging, mining or drilling for oil. Uncontacted groups are extremely vulnerable to basic disease - as such, the report says a threat is posed by contact with evangelical missionaries and social media influencers looking for clicks.Recently, Mashco Piro people have been coming to Nueva Oceania more and more, according to locals.The village is a fishing community of seven or eight families, sitting high on the banks of the Tauhamanu River in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, 10 hours from the nearest settlement by boat.The area is not recognised as a protected reserve for uncontacted groups, and logging companies operate here.Tomas says that, at times, the noise of logging machinery can be heard day and night, and the Mashco Piro people are seeing their forest disturbed and destroyed.In Nueva Oceania, people say they are conflicted. They fear the Mashco Piro's arrows but they also have deep respect for their \"brothers\" who live in the forest and want to protect them.\"Let them live as they live, we can't change their culture. That's why we keep our distance,\" says Tomas.The people in Nueva Oceania are worried about the damage to the Mascho Piro's livelihood, the threat of violence and the possibility that loggers might expose the Mashco Piro to diseases they have no immunity to.While we were in the village, the Mashco Piro made their presence felt again. Letitia Rodriguez Lopez, a young mother with a two-year-old daughter, was in the forest picking fruit when she heard them.\"We heard shouting, cries from people, many of them. As if there were a whole group shouting,\" she told us.It was the first time she had encountered the Mashco Piro and she ran. An hour later, her head was still pounding from fear.\"Because there are loggers and companies cutting down the forest they're running away, maybe out of fear and they end up near us,\" she said. \"We don't know how they might react to us. That's what scares me.\"In 2022, two loggers were attacked by the Mashco Piro while fishing. One was hit by an arrow to the gut. He survived, but the other man was found dead days later with nine arrow wounds in his body.The Peruvian government has a policy of non-contact with isolated people, making it illegal to initiate interactions with them.The policy originated in Brazil after decades of campaigning by indigenous rights groups, who saw that initial contact with isolated people lead to entire groups being wiped out by disease, poverty and malnutrition.In the 1980s, when the Nahau people in Peru made initial contact with the world outside, 50% of their population died within a matter of years. In the 1990s, the Muruhanua people faced the same fate.\"Isolated indigenous peoples are very vulnerable - epidemiologically, any contact could transmit diseases, and even the simplest ones could wipe them out,\" says Issrail Aquisse from the Peruvian indigenous rights group, Femanad. \"Culturally too, any contact or interference can be very harmful to their life and health as a society.\"For the neighbours of uncontacted tribes, the reality of no-contact can be tricky.As Tomas shows us around the forest clearing where he encountered the Mashco Piro, he stops, whistles through his hands and then waits in silence.\"If they answer, we turn back,\" he says. All we can hear is the chatter of insects and birds. \"They're not here.\"Tomas feels the government has left the residents of Nueva Oceania to handle a tense situation by themselves.He plants food in his garden for the Mashco Piro to take. It is a safety measure he and other villagers have come up with to help their neighbours and protect themselves.\"I wish I knew the words to say, 'Here have these plantains, it's a gift,'\" he adds. \"'You can take them freely. Don't shoot me.'\"Almost 200km south-east on the other side of the dense forest, the situation is very different. There, by the Manu River, the Mashco Piro live in an area that is officially recognised as a forest reserve.The Peruvian Ministry of Culture and Fenamad run the \"Nomole\" control post here, staffed by eight agents. It was set up in 2013 when conflict between Mashco Piro and local villages resulted in several killings.As the head of the control post, Antonio Trigoso Ydalgo's job is to stop that from happening again.The Mashco Piro appear regularly, sometimes several times a week. They are a different group of people from those near Nueva Oceania, and the agents don't believe they know each other.\"They always come out at the same place. That's where they shout from,\" Antonio says, pointing across the wide Manu River to a small shingly beach on the other side. They ask for plantain, yucca or sugar cane.\"If we don't answer, they sit there all day waiting,\" Antonio says. The agents try to avoid that, in case tourists or local boats pass by. So they usually comply. The control post has a small garden they grow food in. When it runs out, they ask a local village for supplies.If these aren't available, the agents ask the Mashco Piro to come back in a few days' time. It has worked so far, and there has been little conflict recently.There are about 40 people who Antonio sees regularly - men, women and children from several different families.They name themselves after animals. The chief is called Kamotolo (Honey Bee). The agents say he is a stern man and never smiles.Another leader, Tkotko (Vulture) is more of a joker, he laughs a lot and makes fun of the agents. There is a young woman called Yomako (Dragon) who the agents say has a good sense of humour too.The Mashco Piro don't seem to have much interest in the outside world but are interested in the personal lives of the agents they meet. They ask about their families and where they live.When one agent was pregnant and went on maternity leave, they brought a rattle made from the throat of a howler monkey for the baby to play with.They are interested in the agents' clothes, especially sports clothes in red or green.  \"When we approach, we put on old, torn clothes with missing buttons - so they don't take them,\" Antonio says.\"Before, they wore their own traditional clothing - very beautiful skirts made with threads from insect fibres that they crafted themselves. But now some of them, when tourist boats pass, receive clothes or boots.\" says Eduardo Pancho Pisarlo, an agent at the control post.But any time the team ask about life in the forest, the Mashco Piro shut the conversation down.\"Once, I asked how they light their fires,\" says Antonio. \"They told me, 'You have wood, you know.' I insisted, and they said, 'You already have all these things - why do you want to know?'\"If someone doesn't appear for quite a while, the agents will ask where they are. If the Mashco Piro say, \"Don't ask\", they take it to mean that person has died.After years of contact, the agents still know little about how the Mashco Piro live or why they remain in the forest.It is believed they may be descended from indigenous people who fled into the deep jungle in the late 19th Century, escaping rampant exploitation and widespread massacres by so-called \"rubber barons\".Experts think the Mashco Piro may be closely related to the Yine, an indigenous people from south-eastern Peru. They speak an antiquated dialect of the same language, which the agents, who are also Yine, have been able to learn.But the Yine have long been river navigators, farmers and fishermen, while the Mashco Piro seem to have forgotten how to do these things. They may have become nomads and hunter-gatherers to stay safe.\"What I understand now is that they stay in one area for a while, set up a camp, and the whole family gather,\" says Antonio. \"Once they've hunted everything around that place, they move to another site.\"Issrail Aquisse from Fenamad says more than 100 people have come to the control post at various times.\"They ask for bananas and cassava to diversify their diet, but some families disappear for months or years after that,\" he says.\"They just say: 'I'm going away for a few moons, then I'll come back.' And they say goodbye.\"The Mashco Piro in this area are well protected but the government is building a road which will connect it to an area where illegal mining is widespread.But it is clear to the agents that the Mashco Piro do not want to join the outside world.\"From my experience here at the post, they don't want to become 'civilised',\" Antonio says.\"Maybe the children do, as they grow up and see us wearing clothes, perhaps in 10 or 20 years. But the adults don't. They don't even want us here,\" he says.In 2016, a government bill was passed to extend the Mashco Piro's reserve to an area that would include Nueva Oceania. However, this has never been signed into law.\"We need them to be free like us,\" says Tomas. \"We know they lived very peacefully for years, and now their forests are being finished off - destroyed.\"Platforms, including Open AI's Sora, have gone viral due to their ability to make hyper-realistic videos.Andrew Muir says mistakes had been made with farmers incentivised to increase production, contributing to pollution issues in the lough.Plastic recycling plants in Europe are being shut as they struggle to find a business modelBut bills are still due to rise to fund improvements to water infrastructure.The Environment Agency says the firm is \"significantly below target\".Copyright 2025 BBC.

The whirr of a bike, the brush of a sleeve, and in seconds your whole digital life can be compromised. The pattern of shock and disbelief happens hundreds of times a day on British streets.The impact of phone theft is often more than financial.Fenella Rawling's brand-new iPhone 16 was snatched during a shopping trip in Cambridge in August.On the device were reams of precious memories of her mother, who has incurable lung cancer, which have now been lost forever as the photos weren't backed up and her iCloud had not been set up.\"These are memories that I will never ever ever get back,\" she said through tears.Using an app called Find My, Fenella could see in real time her mobile phone travelling by train to London. A week later, it was in Dubai. Then China. Then came a glut of phishing texts asking her to disclose her account details or wipe the phone.\"I don't know how long I will have with my mum,\" she added. \"I don't want to lose anything.\"Stories like Fenella's have become increasingly common as organised crime groups pivot to stealing phones which can fetch up to £400 per stolen device.Convicted phone snatcher Sonny Stringer was found to have stolen 24 phones in one hour. He was sentenced to two years in prison in August last year.\"It's rich pickings in London,\" said Paul Brennan, chairman of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association.\"No one thinks anything is going to happen to them, until it happens to them, that's the problem. The chances of it happening are skyrocketing,\" he said.\"It's always on an electric bike because they can get away so quickly. They're usually all dressed in black with balaclavas and hoods on.\"We have regular clients who would come in from all across the globe, but they're now calling up and cancelling. They say they aren't coming to London because it isn't safe.\"According to Met Police figures, 117,211 phones were stolen during 2024, up 25% on the 2019 figure of 91,481.The Met said snatchers on the streets of London are most often on lightweight, electric motorbikes, that reach speeds of up to 60mph (97kmh).Because of their prevalence among the snatching gangs the Metropolitan Police have now invested in their own fleet of high-powered bikes to keep up with them.\"They hate us having them,\" said Sgt Ryan Perry, from the force.\"They hate us being out on them. And from our point of view and the public's point of view that's excellent.\"If we can deter the offending then ideal. If they want to come out and play then we'll be there to pursue them and put them in front of a court.\"The battle against the phone thieves is not just being fought on the ground.\"We are a phone snatcher's worst nightmare,\" said Andrew Lawless, tactical flight officer with the National Police Air Service (NPAS).\"Once we get overhead then the odds of them getting away dramatically reduce.\"We can see a lot out the window. We can use our camera and our tools to locate and stay with the suspects,\" he said.Sgt Glen Walker, base manager at NPAS London in Epping Forest, showed the BBC how the onboard cameras can zoom in on the faces of suspects.\"The mere presence of a helicopter being in that area can be a real deterrent,\" he said.\"Obviously, we're quite a big noisy aircraft and if we're 1,000ft (300m) over Westminster, there's been a spate of robberies, you'll often get the suspect hear or see the helicopter and go to ground.\"Police are not alone in the fight against the phone snatchers in London.Diego Galdino is a self-proclaimed \"pickpocket hunter\".A delivery driver by day, he started filming pickpocket moments after saying he witnessed them almost daily, before posting them online.His account \"PickPocketLondon\" amassed millions of views in a matter of months.Mr Galdino said it was his \"instinct\" to warn people when he spots thieves in action.\"I realise the crime around the city getting worse day by day,\" he said.\"They cover their faces, they are always a couple of people and never alone, mainly they are in groups.\"When [a theft] happens, you can't find the item because they have already passed it to someone else, so that's why I always try to shout before they grab it,\" he said.Pickpockets have long been understood to be a transient population in the capital, effectively touring around capital cities and moving on when their faces start to become known by authorities.The British Transport Police (BTP) has also seen a rise in phone thieves commuting into London every day, which officers say is to \"carry out a day's work\".When the BBC joins a patrol at Finsbury Park Station, one British Transport Police officer points out a man walking past.\"The guy in the black baseball cap - we know him - he lives in Portsmouth,\" the officer said. \"He travels from Portsmouth to London every day to commit phone thefts. It is their full-time job.\"After following the suspect for a while at a distance he leaves the station without attempting a snatch. The officers are then called to look for another potential snatcher seen in the area.BTP officers are often patrolling the transport network undercover, particularly around known hotspot areas like Finsbury Park.\"They're doing it on an industrial level - to make a lot of money,\" the officer said, adding many thieves fly into the UK from abroad, spend a few weeks in the UK to steal, before moving on.But phone snatchers in the area are also home grown.\"In the last sort of two years there's been a huge surge of guys from around this area that are part of a wider network of thieves - it's probably in the region of about 600 people,\" the officer said.\"We've certainly got images for at least 600 people that are in that gang.\"Jess Farnham, 24, said swapping her smartphone for an old-style flip-phone was \"life changing\".Needyanand Raya says continued his doctoral studies following a decades-long break to keep a promise.Katie McConnell says she struggled to get life insurance and mortgage protection when buying a home.The Tower's wartime and postwar history will be told as part of the Flights, Camera, Action! event.Terry Fleming, 81, tells other potential victims: \"However smooth and nice they seem, they're not.\"Copyright 2025 BBC.

Nor did the then 81-year-old raise the issue with her.In the book, 107 Days, the former vice-president wrote that Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition\". She wrote that \"perhaps\" she should have raised it with him.In this interview she told the BBC that she still ponders whether she should have acted differently and talked to him about it.\"I do reflect on whether I should have had a conversation with him, urging him not to run.\" She said \"my concern, especially on reflection is, should I have actually raised it\". She questioned whether it was \"grace or recklessness\" that stopped her speaking up.Her worry, she added, was not Biden's capacity to do the job of commander in chief but about whether he would meet the demands of a gruelling election campaign to stay in the White House.When pressed on why there is a distinction, she said there was a serious difference between running for the office and conducting the duties of being president. And running against Trump is even more demanding, she said.She said she had a \"concern about his [Biden's] ability, with the level of endurance, energy, that it requires, especially running against the now current president\".The former vice-president said it was hard for her to speak up because she risked being accused of promoting her own political interests if she had confronted Biden about his health.\"Part of the issue there was that it would – would it have actually been an effective and productive conversation, given what would otherwise appear to be my self-interest?\"The issue of whether more people in Biden's circle could have challenged him about the wisdom of him running again has become a major talking point.One book, Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, alleged that people close to him covered up his physical deterioration from the public.Biden's aides have pushed back at the allegation, saying there were physical changes as he got older but no evidence of mental incapacity and nothing that affected his ability to do the job.In his first interview after leaving the White House, in May of this year, Biden told the BBC it would not have mattered if he had left the race any earlier.His former vice-president is in the UK promoting her new book.

Work is ongoing to dismantle the structures,” wrote Klitschko.Fragments damaged another nine-floor block in the same district, where five people were rescued, he said, adding that “dismantling of structures is ongoing.”More drone fragments fell on a 16-storey residential block in the northern Obolonsky district, damaging an apartment, Klitschko said.“There are no fires or structural collapses,” he added.The full scale of the damage and size of the attack were not immediately known. Kyiv and its surrounding region were under air raid alerts for about 1.5 hours before the air force called them off at about 00:30 GMT.Both sides deny targeting civilians in their attacks on each other’s territory. But thousands have been killed in the war that Russia started with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the vast majority of them Ukrainian, among them many civilians.The attacks came a day after other Russian drone and missile strikes killed four, two of them in Kyiv, and wounded more than a dozen in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities.On Saturday, United States President Donald Trump played down prospects of a summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, saying he was “not going to be wasting [his] time”.The remarks came as Kremlin negotiator Kirill Dmitriev met with Trump administration officials, including special envoy Steve Witkoff, a Russian source familiar with the talks told the AFP news agency. The discussions were expected to continue on Sunday.Earlier this week, the US and the European Union announced new sweeping sanctions on Russian energy aimed at crippling Moscow’s war economy.Putin said he would not bend to pressure from the West. “No self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure,” he said, calling the US sanctions an “unfriendly act”.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Russian overnight attack on Ukraine’s Kyiv kills at least 3, wounds dozens","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/russian-overnight-attack-on-ukraines-kyiv-kills-at-least-3-wounds-dozens","message":""},{"details":"The year was 1965.On a Sunday in Jaunti, a small village on Delhi's outskirts, a hardened Indian farmer stretched out his hand to a visiting farm scientist.\"Dr sahib, we will take up your seed,\" he said.The scientist was MS Swaminathan - later hailed by Time magazine as \"the Godfather of the Green Revolution\" and ranked alongside Gandhi and Tagore among India's most influential figures of the 20th Century.When Swaminathan asked what had convinced the farmer to try his experimental high-yield wheat that day, the man replied that anyone who spent his Sundays walking from field to field for his work was driven by principle, not profit - and that was enough to earn his trust.The farmer's faith would change India's destiny. As Priyambada Jayakumar's new biography The Man Who Fed India shows, Swaminathan's life reads like the story of a nation's leap from \"ship-to-mouth\" survival to food self-sufficiency - reshaping not just India, but Asia's approach to food security.Years of colonial policies had left Indian agriculture stagnant, yields low, soils depleted, and millions of farmers landless or in debt. By the mid-1960s, the average Indian survived on just 417g of food a day, reliant on erratic US wheat imports - a daily wait for grain ships became a national trauma.So dire was the shortage that the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru urged citizens to substitute wheat with sweet potatoes, while the nation's staple carb, rice, remained critically scarce.The 'Green Revolution' turned parched fields into golden harvests, doubling wheat yields in just a few years and transforming a nation on the brink of famine into one of Asia's food powerhouses. It was science in the service of survival, and Swaminathan led the way.Born in 1925 in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, Swaminathan grew up in a family of landlord farmers who prized education and service. He was expected to study medicine, but the 1943 Bengal Famine, which killed more than three million people, stirred him.\"I decided to become a scientist to breed 'smarter' crops which could give us more food... If medicine can save a few lives, agriculture can save millions,\" he told his biographer.So he pursued plant genetics, earning his PhD at Cambridge and then working in the Netherlands and at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. In Mexico, he met Norman Borlaug, the American agronomist and Nobel Prize winner, whose high-yielding dwarf wheat variety would become the backbone of the 'Green Revolution'.In 1963, Swaminathan persuaded Borlaug to send Mexican wheat strains to India.Three years later, as part of a nationwide experiment, India imported 18,000 tonnes of these seeds. Swaminathan adapted and multiplied them under Indian conditions, producing golden-hued varieties that yielded two to three times more than local wheat while resisting disease and pests.The seed import and rollout was far from smooth, Jayakumar writes.Bureaucrats feared dependence on foreign germplasm, logistics slowed down  shipping and customs, and farmers clung to tall, familiar varieties.Swaminathan overcame these challenges with data and advocacy - and by personally walking the fields with his family, offering seeds directly to farmers. In Punjab, he even enlisted prisoners to stitch seed packets for rapid distribution during sowing season.While the Mexican short-grain wheat was red, Swaminathan ensured the hybrid varieties were golden to suit leavened Indian breads like naans and rotis. Named Kalyan Sona and Sonalika - \"sona\" means gold in Hindi - these high-yielding grains helped turn the northern states of Punjab and Haryana into breadbaskets.With Swaminathan's experiments, India quickly shifted to self-sufficiency. By 1971, yields had doubled, turning famine into surplus in just four years - a miracle that saved a generation.Swaminathan's guiding philosophy was \"farmer-first\", according to Jayakumar.\"Do you know the field is also a laboratory? And that farmers are actual scientists? They know far more than even I do,\" he told his biographer.Scientists, he insisted, must listen before prescribing solutions. He spent weekends in villages, asking about soil moisture, seed prices, and pests.In Odisha, he worked with tribal women to improve rice varieties. In the dry belts of Tamil Nadu, he promoted salt-tolerant crops. And in Punjab, he told sceptical landowners that science alone wouldn't end hunger and that \"science must walk with compassion\".Swaminathan was keenly aware of the challenges facing Indian farming. As chair of the National Commission on Farmers, he oversaw five reports between 2004 and 2006, culminating in a final report that examined the roots of farmer distress and rising suicides, calling for a comprehensive national farmers' policy.Even in his late 90s, he stood with farmers - at 98, he publicly supported those protesting in Punjab and Haryana against controversial agricultural reforms.Swaminathan's influence extended far beyond India.As the first Indian Director-General of the IRRI in the Philippines in the 1980s, he spread high-yield rice across Southeast Asia, boosting production in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.From Malaysia to Iran, Egypt to Tanzania, he advised governments, helped rebuild Cambodia's rice gene bank, trained North Korean women farmers, aided African agronomists during the Ethiopian drought, and mentored generations across Asia - his work also shaped China's hybrid-rice programme and sparked Africa's Green Revolution.In 1987, he became the first recipient of the World Food Prize, honoured as a \"living legend\" by the UN Secretary-General for his role in ending hunger.His later work through the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation in Chennai focused on biodiversity, coastal restoration and what he called a \"pro-poor, pro-women, pro-nature\" model of development.The Green Revolution's success also brought serious costs: intensive farming drained groundwater, degraded soil and contaminated fields with pesticides, while wheat and rice monocultures eroded biodiversity and heightened climate vulnerability, especially in Punjab and Haryana.Swaminathan acknowledged these risks and, in the 1990s, called for an \"Evergreen Revolution\" - high productivity without ecological harm. He warned that future progress would rely not on fertiliser, but on conserving water, soil, and seeds.A rare public figure, he paired data with empathy - donating much of his 1971 Ramon Magsaysay Award amount to rural scholarships and later promoting gender equality and digital literacy for farmers long before \"agri-tech\" was a buzzword.Reflecting on his impact, Naveen Patnaik, former chief minister of Odisha, says:  \"His legacy reminds us that freedom from hunger is the greatest freedom of all.\"In Swaminathan's life, science and compassion combined to give millions that very freedom. He died in 2023, aged 98, leaving a lasting legacy in sustainable, farmer-focused agriculture.Fewer diners are \"hitting the Hut\" and it is closing half its UK restaurants.Launched in Bristol in February, CRuNCH has visited 14 schools and help more than 350 children.Catriona Byers is an expert on 19th Century morgue who also works as a food stylist.Drugs like Ozempic have allowed many people to lose weight they were unable to shift before.

At least 43 people have died in the attacks.United Nations officials and scholars of international law have said that the strikes are in clear violation of US and international law and amount to extrajudicial executions.Venezuela’s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said Saturday the country is conducting military exercises to protect its coast against any potential “covert operations”.“We are conducting an exercise that began 72 hours ago, a coastal defence exercise … to protect ourselves not only from large-scale military threats but also to protect ourselves from drug trafficking, terrorist threats and covert operations that aim to destabilise the country internally,” Padrino said.Venezuelan state television showed images of military personnel deployed in nine coastal states and a member of Maduro’s civilian militia carrying a Russian Igla-S shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile.“CIA is present not only in Venezuela but everywhere in the world,” Padrino said. “They may deploy countless CIA-affiliated units in covert operations from any part of the nation, but any attempt will fail.”Since August, Washington has deployed a fleet of eight US Navy ships, 10 F-35 warplanes and a nuclear-powered submarine for anti-drug operations, but Caracas maintains these manoeuvres mask a plan to overthrow the Venezuelan government.Maduro said on Saturday he had started legal proceedings to revoke the citizenship and cancel the passport of opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez, whom he accuses of egging on an invasion.Lopez, a well-known Venezuelan opposition figure who has been exiled in Spain since 2020, has publicly expressed his support for the deployment of US ships in the Caribbean and attacks on suspected drug trafficking vessels.The opposition leader reacted on his X account, dismissing the move because “according to the Constitution, no Venezuelan born in Venezuela can have their nationality revoked.” He once more expressed support for a US military deployment and military actions in the country.Lopez spent more than three years in a military prison after participating in antigovernment protests in 2014. He was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison on charges of “instigation and conspiracy to commit a crime”.He was later granted house arrest and, after being released by a group of military personnel during a political crisis in Venezuela, left the country in 2020.In the meantime, the US has also put Colombia’s leadership in its crosshairs.The US Department of the Treasury slapped sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family and the South American country’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti.Friday’s decision marked a significant escalation in the ongoing feud between the left-wing Petro and his US counterpart, the right-wing Trump.In a statement, the US Treasury accused Petro of failing to rein in Colombia’s cocaine industry and of shielding criminal groups from accountability.The Treasury cited Petro’s “Total Peace” plan, an initiative designed to bring an end to Colombia’s six-decade-long internal conflict through negotiations with armed rebels and criminal organisations.Petro, a prolific social media user, quickly shot back that the Treasury’s decision was the culmination of longstanding Republican threats, including from US Senator Bernie Moreno, a critic of his presidency.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Venezuela’s Maduro says the US is ‘fabricating’ a war against him","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/venezuelas-maduro-says-the-us-is-fabricating-a-war-against-him","message":""},{"details":"A migrant sex offender mistakenly released from an Essex prison was last seen in north London on Friday evening, according to the Metropolitan Police.Hadush Kebatu was spotted shortly before 20:00 on Friday in the Dalston area of Hackney, the Met Police said in a statement.CCTV footage also shows him at a library in Dalston Square at around 18:00, wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit and carrying a white bag decorated with pictures of avocados.Additional officers have been deployed to the area to locate the Ethiopian national, who was set free from HMP Chelmsford four weeks after being jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex, while staying at the Bell Hotel as an asylum seeker.Appealing to Kebatu, Cmd James Conway said: \"We want to locate you in a safe and controlled way.\"He added: \"You had already indicated a desire to return to Ethiopia when speaking to immigration staff. The best outcome for you is to make contact directly with us by either calling 999 or reporting yourself to a police station.\"On Saturday, Conway said the force was \"pursuing all lines of enquiry\" into his disappearance, adding that Kebatu had access to funds and had sought assistance from members of the public.Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, has made a number of train journeys across London since he boarded a train in Chelmsford at 12:41 on Friday afternoon, before getting off at Stratford, Conway added.Anyone who sees Kebatu should call 999 immediately, the Met Police said in a statement.Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy has ordered candidates to be chosen to lead an independent investigation into Kebatu's accidental release.In addition, new procedures for prisons will come into effect on Monday, mandating additional checks the evening before a release is due to take place.Duty governors - responsible for the daily secure operation of the prison - will have to confirm the procedure is in place on Monday.A Sexual Harm Prevention Order was made against Kebatu, when he was sentenced in September, on the grounds the judge agreed he posed a risk of sexual harm to female adults and children.Earlier, Essex Police - who handed the lead of the investigation to the Met at 11:30 on Saturday - said: \"It is not lost on us that this situation is concerning to people, and we are committed to locating and arresting him as quickly as possible.\"It is not clear exactly what led to his release, but prison sources have told the BBC prison staff from HMP Chelmsford lead Kebatu away from the prison and towards the train station.A prison officer from HMP Chelmsford has been suspended, but a senior prison staffer said the error was \"down to a series of mistakes, probably because staff are overworked and in short supply\".\"It's not just one prison officer who's to blame. That would be unfair,\" they added.John Podmore - a former governor of HMP Brixton, Belmarsh and Swaleside, and a former prison inspector - said the error should be seen \"in the context of wider failure\", adding he hoped a \"lower down official is not thrown under the bus\".\"I am afraid this is what happens in a broken system and the prison system is broken,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Kebatu's arrest in July sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living after arriving in the UK.In September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work.During the trial, Kebatu gave his date of birth as December 1986, making him 38, but court records suggested he was 41.He was found guilty of five offences and sentenced to 12 months. He was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.The court heard it was his \"firm wish\" to be deported.It is not clear where Kebatu was being deported to but under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.Kebatu was arrested on 8 July and was released in error 108 days later. Upon his release he would have been eligible for a £76 discharge payment.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the incident showed that the UK's \"once-trusted institutions\", including the police and prisons, were \"disintegrating before our eyes\".\"Nobody who arrives by small boat should be free to walk our streets,\" he added.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the release was a \"level of incompetence that beggars belief\".\"Conservatives voted against Labour's prisoner release program because it was putting predators back on our streets,\" she said on X.A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.Needyanand Raya says continued his doctoral studies following a decades-long break to keep a promise.Katie McConnell says she struggled to get life insurance and mortgage protection when buying a home.The Tower's wartime and postwar history will be told as part of the Flights, Camera, Action! event.Terry Fleming, 81, tells other potential victims: \"However smooth and nice they seem, they're not.\"One officer said pickpockets fly in from abroad and fly out once they've amassed a haul of phones.Copyright 2025 BBC.

They did not say whether they will close the Sangster airport in Montego Bay, on the western side of the island.More than 650 shelters were activated in Jamaica. Officials said warehouses across the island were well-stocked and thousands of food packages prepositioned for quick distribution if needed.Melissa was expected to unleash punishing rains of up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) on Jamaica and southern Hispaniola – Haiti and the Dominican Republic – according to the hurricane centre.It should be near or over Cuba by the middle of the week. The Cuban government on Saturday afternoon issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin.The erratic and slow-moving storm has killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth person in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.“Unfortunately for places along the projected path of this storm, it is increasingly dire,” Jamie Rhome, the centre’s deputy director, said earlier on Saturday. He said the storm will continue to move slowly for up to four days.In Haiti, there were also reports of rising river levels, flooding and a bridge destroyed due to breached riverbanks in Sainte-Suzanne, in the northeast.“The storm is causing a lot of concern with the way it’s moving,” said Ronald Delice, a Haitian department director of civil protection, as local authorities organised lines to distribute food kits. Many residents are still reluctant to leave their homes.The storm has damaged nearly 200 homes in the Dominican Republic and knocked out water supply systems, affecting more than half a million customers. It also downed trees and traffic lights, unleashed a couple of small landslides and left more than two dozen communities isolated by floodwaters.The Bahamas Department of Meteorology said Melissa could bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to islands in the Southeast and Central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by early next week.Melissa is the 13th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Hurricane Melissa, now Category 3, threatens heavy floods in Jamaica, Haiti","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/hurricane-melissa-now-category-3-threatens-heavy-floods-in-jamaica-haiti","message":""},{"details":"Thailand and Cambodia sign an enhanced ceasefire agreement following a deadly five-day conflict along their border in July.By Tim Hume and Erin HaleShareSaveKuala Lumpur, Malaysia – Thailand and Cambodia have signed an expanded ceasefire agreement in the presence of United States President Donald Trump in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, building on a deal that ended deadly border fighting in July.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul signed the agreement on Sunday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur, shortly after Trump’s arrival.​​”We did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done,” said Trump, who co-signed the agreement along with summit host Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as he made his first trip to Asia since returning to the White House.Thailand’s Anutin said the agreement creates “the building blocks for a lasting peace”, while the Cambodian premier Hun called it a “historic day”.The agreement builds on a truce reached three months ago when Trump used the threat of higher tariffs against both countries to persuade them to end five days of fighting that resulted in dozens of deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands.The first phase of the agreement involves Thailand releasing 18 Cambodian soldiers, and the removal of heavy weapons from the border region, with Malaysian troops to be deployed to ensure fighting does not restart.Territory along the 800km (500-mile) frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades.Following the signing of the ceasefire agreement on Sunday, Trump inked separate economic deals with Cambodia and Thailand, involving an agreement on reciprocal trade with Phnom Penh and a deal on critical minerals with Bangkok.Malaysia’s Anwar, who was also present at the signing, praised the agreement during his opening remarks at the summit, saying “it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.”Reporting from Sa Kaeo, Thailand, Al Jazeera’s Tony Cheng said the agreement signed on Sunday essentially reinforced “agreements that have already been made”.Malaysian troops had been supposed to deploy under the initial peace agreement signed in July, but had not yet arrived, he said.He said that while Thais welcomed “any kind of move towards peace”, they were viewing the agreement as “the beginning of the end” to the conflict, rather than hailing it as having resolved the dispute in itself.“The devil is going to be in the details of this agreement,” he said.He said the Thai military had been working to clear some disputed border areas, at the same time as some villages had been building new bomb shelters in recent weeks.“So people here are still concerned this could go either way,” he said.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Trump jointly signs Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire agreement at ASEAN summit","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/26/trump-jointly-signs-thailand-cambodia-ceasefire-agreement-at-asean-summit","message":""},{"details":"The president’s swing through Malaysia, Japan and Korea will also include meetings with allies strained by tariffs.KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — President Donald Trump lands in Asia this weekend for a multinational swing that will culminate in a high-stakes meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as the U.S. president attempts to stabilize the relationship with the world’s second-largest economy amid a trade war he instigated.","headline":"President to meet with China’s Xi as he travels to Asia to contain trade war","level":"info","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/25/trump-xi-china-trade-war-meeting/","message":""},{"details":"Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.The US president called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship in a social media post on Saturday.Ontario's premier said he would take it down to allow trade talks with the US to proceed, after Trump withdrew - but that it would still run in the US over the weekend.Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said of the tariff increase: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration.\"Trump's decision comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney.But he said it would still appear during games for the World Series, including between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip.Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"Trump calls it historic, Thailand only calls is \"a pathway to peace\", but all sides hope the agreement will stick.The former vice-president tells the BBC she is not sure whether it was “grace or recklessness” that stopped her speaking up.The man is a US citizen and a Trump supporter, the president said, but declined to identify him.Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy. Now, residents are concerned about their impact on real estate and electricity costs.The deployment marks a major escalation in what the US says is a campaign against drug traffickers, which Trump warns will include \"land action\".Copyright 2025 BBC.

Before the conflict, Jebel Marra's organic oranges were particularly prized across the country for their juiciness.The mountainous area in this part of the western Darfur region is dotted with green peaks, especially now as it is the rainy season.The rest of Sudan teeters on the edge of disaster.Across the country, as a result of the two-and-a-half years of fighting that has crippled agriculture, almost 25 million people - half the population - are facing severe food shortages, including more than 600,000 who are experiencing famine, according to the UN.But in the lush highlands of Jebel Marra, the problem is not growing food – it is getting the produce out.\"We almost sell them for free and sometimes get rid of them on the way [to market], because they get rotten,\" says Hafiz Ali, an orange vendor in Golo town, which is in the midst of the mountains in Central Darfur state.The insecurity and the poor state of the roads make transportation almost impossible.Jebel Marra is the last remaining territory controlled by the Sudan Liberation Army - Abdulwahid (SLA-AW). This armed group has remained neutral in the current war. It has never signed a peace deal with the authorities in Khartoum going back to 2003 and the conflict over Darfur at that time.SLA-AW has controlled what locals describe as \"liberated areas\" for more than two decades.Now, surrounded by war on all sides, the region is increasingly isolated.To the west and north, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied Arab militias have blocked major roads. To the south, RSF positions are bombed almost every week by the Sudanese army - these attacks are also claiming civilian lives.The RSF also control areas to the east.The result is a closed-off environment where farmers and middlemen can no longer reach the national markets in the cities of el-Fasher 130km (82 miles) away, or Tine, on the Chadian border, 275km (170 miles) away.There are other alternatives but none have the same national reach and all involve treacherous journeys.Tawila, right on the edge of SLA-AW territory, has become the site of a makeshift market. It is on the road to el-Fasher, which is cut off by an RSF siege, and has become home to tens of thousands who have managed to flee that city.Because of the difficulty of moving the produce any further, there is an oversupply in the market and as a result prices here have fallen.There are some here who are looking to buy supplies to try and smuggle produce into el-Fasher - an extremely dangerous and life-threatening trade.Getting goods this far has always been a challenge and food can sometimes rot on the way.\"To travel about 12km, it takes you a whole day of driving in the mountains and the mud,\" says Yousif, a fruit vendor in Tawila. But now, he says, the insecurity makes things even worse.In Central Darfur, a recent truce between leaders from the Fur ethnic group - dominant here - and Arab nomads has allowed limited trade in some areas.Markets have reopened in the SLA-AW- controlled town of Nertiti, where Arab women sell sour milk and Fur farmers bring fruit and vegetables. But the arrangement is fragile.\"The market only opens once a week. Travel is still dangerous,\" says a trader from Nertiti.\"Armed robberies still happen on the roads, even after the agreement.\"Fruit and crops can now also be sold in the market in RSF-controlled Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur state. But Arab militias allied to the RSF are frequently accused of harassing or attacking civilians in the area, though the groups deny any wrongdoing.Each Thursday, which is market day, the number of checkpoints between Nertiti and Zalingei increases, sometimes reaching more than two dozen. But as more vehicles are on the road on market days, more people take the opportunity to travel.The checkpoints, some manned by RSF fighters and others by Arab militia, are sometimes overseen by just one armed man in plainclothes, who demands a fee. Drivers will then often try to negotiate as passengers watch on silently.Returning back to the Jebel Marra region, SLA-AW checkpoints guard every road into the mountains, and armed men also demand money.Bags are searched with contraband, even including skin-bleaching creams, widely used elsewhere in Sudan, are confiscated.Once inside the SLA-AW controlled area, despite the relative peace, there are clear signs of the conflict elsewhere in the country.Lorries filled with people fleeing the fighting, particularly around el-Fasher, can be seen on a daily basis.Many of them find shelter in schools, clinics and other public spaces receiving little to no humanitarian assistance - aid agencies struggle to get through all the checkpoints.In Golo, the de facto capital of the SLA-AW territory, a woman who had escaped from el-Fasher, described the dire conditions. She is now sheltering in a classroom with 25 other freshly arrived families.\"We have no income. No jobs to do, I used to work as a nurse and I can farm, but the land here belongs to people who work only for themselves. We don't know what to do,\" the woman said.As she spoke, sick, elderly people lay on the ground and children were screaming from hunger. At least there will be some relief as the food that could not be taken out of Golo will be available.This is the Jebel Marra region, a strange world surrounded by war. A world of green mountains and waterfalls. A world of bright, juicy fruit. A world of frightened evacuees.One fruit trader said he had lost hope in both warring parties.\"We're not part of the war - we just want to sell our oranges.\"Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaAndry Rajoelina, who was removed from power in a coup last week, had already acquired French nationality.The false belief that body parts of people with albinism bring wealth or luck have driven attacks.Issa Tchiroma Bakary says he won the election and is not concerned about being arrested or put in jail.Cameroon opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary is adamant that he's the winner of the presidential election.Their neighbours, who raise livestock, told the family to get rid of the wild animal.Copyright 2025 BBC.

After months of relative calm, the US and China have slapped each other with sweeping trade measures in recent weeks, straining relations between the rival powers. Talks between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterparts have “set the stage for the leaders’ meeting,” Bessent told reporters Sunday.• Before he arrived in Asia, Trump announced a hike in tariffs on Canada, addressed peace efforts in Gaza and Ukraine, and previewed his meetings with key leaders in comments made during the long-haul flight.The backdrop at the signing ceremony in Kuala Lumpur heralded a “Cambodia Thailand Peace Deal” but the document signed by the neighboring countries on Sunday suggests the current ceasefire falls far short of what President Donald Trump twice incorrectly called a “peace treaty.”The “peace deal” was titled: “Joint Declaration by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.”Treaties hold a much higher status and become governed by international law, whereas declarations are often used when the parties “do not intend to create binding obligations but merely want to declare certain aspirations,” according to the UN.The declaration includes:Amid lavish praise of the US president for his mediation efforts, Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul qualified Sunday’s signing ceremony as a “concrete step towards peace” that would hinge on “full implementation” of the declaration.Thai diplomats have been carefully reticent about Sunday’s joint declaration, calling it a “reaffirmation” of a ceasefire both sides agreed to in July.Hun Manet, the prime minister of Cambodia – whose country is dwarfed by Thailand, economically and militarily – announced “a strong commitment to fully and faithfully implementing this joint declaration.”The United States and Thailand have agreed to the outline of a trade deal to broaden market access, strengthen supply chains, and deepen economic cooperation, according to a joint statement issued by the White House Sunday.Under the framework, Thailand will remove tariffs on 99% of US goods, while the US will maintain 19% “reciprocal tariffs” and grant zero-tariff access for select Thai products.The joint statement says both nations are committed to tackling non-tariff barriers, adhering to labor laws, maintaining high environmental standards, and expanding cooperation in digital trade and intellectual property.Thailand also agreed to buy an estimated $2.6 billion in US agricultural goods annually, $5.4 billion in energy products, and 80 US aircraft worth $18.8 billion.Negotiations and a finalized agreement are expected in the coming weeks, according to the White House.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the US and Thailand aimed to reach a firm deal by the end of the year.“We will also sign the (memorandum of understanding) between our governments on cooperation on critical minerals, which will further promote resilient and sustainable supply chains for years to come.”The serious business of signing the Thailand-Cambodia peace agreement took on a lighter mood as Southeast Asian leaders used the moment to heap praise – and some gentle ribbing – on US President Donald Trump.“I was in prison, but you almost got there,” Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said during his opening remarks, nodding to what he described as commonalities between himself and Trump.Anwar served time over charges of corruption and sodomy – charges he claims were false and politically motivated. Trump was convicted last year of felony charges linked to a hush-money payment to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, a verdict the US president disputes.The Malaysian leader also said Trump was “delighted to break the rules” on security protocols earlier that day to offer Anwar a ride to the gathering in his limousine. “It was a nice ride,” he added.Hun Manet, Cambodia’s prime minister, reiterated his nomination of Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in resolving his country’s five-day conflict with Thailand in July. Trump has long coveted the honor, which is bestowed annually, most recently earlier this month.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul thanked Trump for his “personal dedication” to peace between the two countries.An initial ceasefire between the two countries brokered in Malaysia was signed on July 28 after the US president held calls with leaders on both sides. He warned then that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued – a threat that came as both faced elevated tariffs from the US under Trump’s global trade war.Trump also kept the mood light at Sunday’s ceremony.He recounted speaking over the phone with the three Southeast Asian leaders over the July conflict while at his golf resort in Scotland.“I said, this is much more important than playing a round of golf, so we sat there all day long, making phone calls,” he said.“You cost me very good entertainment… but this is much more fun for me… because you’re saving people.”CNN’s Ivan Watson, who is in Kuala Lumpur, breaks down the signing ceremony between Cambodia and Thailand that US President Donald Trump joined.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emerged from a meeting with his Chinese counterpart suggesting the table has been set for a deal between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they meet face-to-face in South Korea in the coming days.“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday. We discussed trade, the rare earths, the fentanyl, TikToks and the overall relationship between the two countries,” Bessent told reporters here in Kuala Lumpur.The high-stakes trade talks ended Sunday afternoon local time (early hours, ET) and Bessent said they “set the stage for the leaders’ meeting.” The Trump-Xi meeting come after trade tensions between the US and China have ratcheted up in recent weeks, with Trump threatening sweeping 130% tariffs on China and export controls on critical software. Beijing, in turn, has signaled it could retaliate.Bessent described the talks as “constructive” and “far-reaching,” and said there was “new nuance” to discussions.He suggested that the extension of a trade truce between the US and China is likely to move forward, but deferred to Trump.“Coming out of this meeting I would say yes, but that is at the end of the day President Trump’s decision,” Bessent said.He also described “significant discussions” on agricultural purchases.Though talks between the US and Chinese delegations have been at times tense, Bessent told CNN that there was “great respect” during the two-day talks in Malaysia.“This was the fifth time that Vice Premier He Lifeng and I have seen each other – great respect. And I think what was different this time is that this was in preparation for the meeting with the two leaders, so we were determined to provide them with a framework for a successful meeting in Korea, which I think it will be,” he said.A lasting peace deal between Thailand and Cambodia is still “a long road” away despite the agreement Donald Trump trumpeted on Sunday, a Thai political expert has told CNN.The US president wanted to “get credit for peace” but the deal signed on Sunday fell short of being a “final peace treaty,” Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, said.He argued that Trump “conflated peace and trade,” believing that he could use trade and tariffs to induce a peace deal.But enduring peace will involve “a feeling of lasting justice and fairness,” he said.“President Trump wants a quick win. But on the ground, it’s much more complicated,” he said.Though he called Sunday’s deal a step “in the right direction,” Thitinan cautioned: “There’s a long road ahead for some kind of a lasting peace deal, peace agreement, let alone treaty.”President Donald Trump heralded the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia as he described efforts to secure a peace agreement between the countries. He praised Thailand’s Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodia’s Hun Manet for being respectful toward each other, in stark contrast with how he’s described conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s war in Ukraine.“What makes me so happy is the two countries we’re dealing with … they really like each other. I’m not used to that. When I do these deals, usually there’s a lot of hatred,” Trump said as the leaders prepared to sign the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords.The two leaders had “great respect for each other,” Trump said, which “made it a little bit easier.”Trump has frequently described animosity between Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.“There’s a lot of bad blood with the two presidents, and I’m not speaking out of turn when I say it’s a very, very difficult situation,” Trump recently told reporters at the White House.The president said Sunday that observers from ASEAN countries will “be deployed to make sure that the peace prevails and endures,” drawing contrasts with a fragile peace deal between Israel and Hamas.“I have no doubt that it will. We have another situation like that right now in the Middle East and Gaza. You might have read a little bit about Gaza, and that’s another one we’re very proud of. But we have a lot of people watching that – a lot of people. I think this is a much different kind of a thing,” he said.Alongside the Trump-signed peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand, the United States will ink major economic agreements with both countries, according to Trump.“We also are signing a major trade deal with Cambodia and a very important critical minerals agreement with Thailand,” Trump said.“The United States will have robust commerce and cooperation, transactions, lots of them, with both nations, as long as they live in peace.”Trump thanked US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who he referred to as “the foremost expert on trade.” He then briefly spoke about additional stops during the trip where trade will top the agenda. “We’re going to be doing another couple of stops where we’re talking about no war, just pure trade,” he said.The president also said he will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.“We’ll be stopping at Japan. We’ll be stopping at South Korea. We’ll be doing some other things with him, more related to trade,” Trump added.President Donald Trump joined in the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand during a summit of Southeast Asian nations in Malaysia on Sunday.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, alongside Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, signed the accord during an on-stage ceremony in front of a backdrop displaying the seal of the United States and the phrase “delivering peace.”Border tensions between the two countries exploded into a five-day conflict in July that left dozens of civilians dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of people.Trump has taken credit for resolving the conflict. An initial ceasefire brokered in Malaysia was signed on July 28 after the US president held calls with leaders on both sides and warned both that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued.US President Donald Trump extended his condolences to Thailand’s late Queen Mother Sirikit, calling her the “embodiment of dignity, kindness and grace.”Sirikit died Saturday, aged 93.Trump described her as “a beautiful, incredible woman who is so respected all over the world,” speaking before a ceremony where Thailand and Cambodia signed a peace agreement after fighting a brief border dispute earlier in the year.“I know the people of Thailand will remember her forever as the embodiment of dignity, kindness and grace,” he said.Trump said the peace agreement would “honor the memory by bringing the blessing of peace to the nation she dearly loved.”The ceremony was conducted earlier in the day so that Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul could return early following Sirikit’s passing.For context: Sirikit supervised royal projects to help the rural poor, preserve traditional craft-making and protect the environment.She had been largely absent from public life in recent years due to declining health. Her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, died in October 2016.Read more about her here.Trump praised his own abilities to broker peace deals, in opening remarks at a ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand are expected to sign a peace accord.The US president recalled that the conflict “was one of the first wars” that he “got involved in.”“I love doing it. I love … it’s like, I shouldn’t say it’s a hobby, because it’s so much more serious than a hobby, but something that I’m good at, and it’s something I love to do,” Trump said in his remarks.The United Nations should be doing this, but they don’t do it.The deadly border conflict that erupted between Thailand and Cambodia in July is among many “un-endable wars” Trump claims to have ended.An initial ceasefire brokered in Malaysia was signed on July 28 after the US president held calls with leaders on both sides and warned both that he would not make trade deals with either if the conflict continued.Among the many “un-endable wars” Trump has claimed to have ended is the deadly border conflict that erupted between Thailand and Cambodia in July.Dozens of people, mostly civilians, were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes on both sides of their 508-mile (817-kilometer) disputed border – much of which was mapped by Cambodia’s former colonial ruler France more than 100 years ago, and which has been prone to flareups of violence for decades.During the five-day conflict, Thailand deployed F-16 fighter jets against Cambodian military targets. As an American treaty ally, Thailand’s military maintains close ties with the US military.Cambodia – which this year completed its seventh round of annual military drills with close ally China – fired rockets and shells into Thailand.Both sides blamed the other for starting the conflict.Into the fray entered Trump, who held calls with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and then acting prime minister of Thailand Phumtham Wechayachai, warning both that he would not make trade deals with either country if the conflict continued.Trump had previously threatened Thailand and Cambodia with a 36% tariff on most of their exports to the US. (Both countries ended up with a 19% tariff.)Following the calls, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire.Within days, military leaders from both countries agreed to a ceasefire declaration on July 28 in Malaysia, brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Hun Manet then said that he nominated the US president for the Nobel Peace Prize.President Donald Trump is addressing dignitaries gathered at a ceremony where Cambodia and Thailand are set to sign a peace agreement on the sidelines of a summit of Southeast Asian nations in Malaysia on Sunday.“This is so exciting, because we did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done,” Trump said in opening remarks. “Two great countries, but they were going at it. I want to congratulate the two courageous leaders … for taking this monumental step.”Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul are attending the ceremony, alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.US President Donald Trump was greeted by dignitaries, dancers and waving flags as he arrived in Malaysia late Saturday (﻿Sunday morning, local time).Trump will attend two regional summits in Asia, where he is set to meet with key leaders including his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.He’s due to oversee the signing of a peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia shortly. Trade is also on the agenda on Sunday, with tensions high between the US and Canada and talks between the US and China going on.Here’s what you need to know:US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer expressed optimism for a potential US-China trade deal when President Donald Trump meets with China’s leader Xi Jinping later this week.Greer, along with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, held meetings with top Chinese officials on Saturday and Sunday in Kuala Lumpur where, Greer said, they negotiated a framework for Trump and Xi to discuss at what is expected to be a high-stakes meeting with global economic implications amid a long-simmering trade war.“I think we’re moving forward to the final details of the type of agreement that the leaders can review and decide if they want to conclude together,” Greer told reporters.He described the discussions as “broad-ranging” and “constructive.”“We had quite constructive discussions with our Chinese counterparts. We think we’re getting to a point where we have something we can present to the leaders,” he said, noting that there were talks about rare earth minerals, among other topics.Negotiators, he said, are “getting to the spot where the leaders will have a very productive meeting this coming week.”On Saturday, Trump indicated he was open to making some concessions as he suggested a “very good chance of making a very comprehensive deal.”“They have to make concessions. I guess we would too. We’re at 157% tariff for them. I don’t think that’s sustainable for them, and they want to get that down. And we want certain things from them,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One.As he headed to Asia for a diplomatic swing expected to include a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Donald Trump appeared wary of responding to questions from reporters on one of the thorniest issues in US-China relations: Taiwan.Trump confirmed that the self-ruling democracy would be among topics discussed in the upcoming meeting with Xi, expected to take place on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea next week.But the US president had little to say on the subject when pressed by reporters traveling on Air Force One.Asked whether he would consider changing US policy on Taiwan, Trump said he didn’t “want to talk about that now.”“I don’t want to create any complexity. The trip is already complex enough.”The US president also said it “would be very dangerous” for China to make any move on Taiwan, when asked by a reporter why he had earlier said he did not think China wanted to invade the island.Here’s some background: China’s ruling Communist Party claims self-governing Taiwan as its own, despite never having ruled it, and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary. Beijing in recent years has ramped up its military, economic and diplomatic pressure on Taipei.The US maintains a close unofficial relationship with Taiwan and is required by law to provide it with the means for its defense – a relationship that irks Chinese officials and is seen by Beijing as the most sensitive issue among a host of frictions with the US.Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million people. Washington has long maintained a policy that that it does not support Taiwan’s independence.Analysts believe that Xi hopes for a key concession from Trump: a change in US policy to “oppose Taiwan independence.”Canada will focus on “constructive discussions” with America despite US President Donald Trump’s latest threat to hike tariffs by 10%, the country’s US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said.“We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks,” LeBlanc said in a statement late Saturday.“We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the U.S. administration — which is the responsibility of the federal government,” he added.Some background: Canada has been trying to get trade talks with the US back on track after Trump said on Thursday that he was terminating negotiations due an ad from the Canadian province of Ontario that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech by former US President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Ontario has agreed to pull the ad from Monday.Trump announced on Saturday that he intended to raise tariffs on Canadian goods by 10% “over and above what they are paying now.”US President Donald Trump received a red-carpet welcome here in Kuala Lumpur, where dozens of special guests gathered, waving American and Malaysian flags as Air Force One taxied into place.Trump descended the steps and warmly greeted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, walking past an honor guard to greet top officials.Malaysian music played as dancers dressed in traditional ensembles performed – and the president walked toward them, dancing along to the beat, swaying his hips, and pumping his arms in the air for a brief, but memorable, moment.The president held up an American and a Malaysian flag, as he smiled and greeted a welcoming crowd before boarding his motorcade.Trump touched down in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia this morning for a five-day diplomatic tour, but the most consequential meeting on his agenda won’t come until later in the week.The US president is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea, the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since Trump’s return to office and the escalation of a fresh US-China tech and trade war.Much is at stake in the meeting, with everything from the world’s supply of critical rare earths to the global shipping industry touched by the tussle between the world’s two largest economies.Trump projected optimism while en route to Asia Saturday, saying he and Xi had a “really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal.”Issues around tech and trade are expected to top the agenda, as the White House looks to push China to ease off on a sweeping expansion of rare earths export controls announced earlier this month. Xi and his officials will be pushing for the US to ease their own export controls around Chinese access to US high-tech.Hanging over the entire proposition is the threat of the return of US tariffs so high they would amount to a de facto trade embargo on Chinese goods.Trade negotiators from both sides are meeting in Kuala Lumpur this weekend to hammer out details ahead of the top-level talks. Unlike Washington, Beijing so far has declined to confirm that the two leaders will meet next week.US President Donald Trump didn’t rule out meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip this week to several Asian countries, saying shortly before he left the US on Friday that he’d “like” to, but wasn’t sure if it would happen.“I don’t know. We let him know. He knows that I’m going there,” Trump told reporters shortly before embarking on his long-haul flight to the continent.“I get along with him very well,” the president said of the North Korean leader, as he departed the South Lawn for Joint Base Andrews.Trump administration officials have privately discussed setting up a meeting between the president and North Korean leader, though many are skeptical that it will ultimately happen, sources familiar with the matter told CNN before the trip.In Trump’s first term, officials arranged a handshake between the two men in the Korean demilitarized zone less than 48 hours after the president tweeted an invitation to get together — an example of how quickly things can change.CNN’s Will Ripley broke down the possibility of a similar meeting this week:President Donald Trump says he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip to Asia.

And he’s said that the conflict whose resolution has been most elusive — Russia’s war in Ukraine — will be on the agenda during the highest-stakes meeting of the trip, with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, with which the US is embroiled in a simmering trade war.In Kuala Lumpur, Trump will sign a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, the president said Saturday. The Southeast Asian neighbors agreed to a ceasefire in July to end escalating violence on their disputed border, after Trump warned their respective leaders he would not make trade deals with them if the deadly conflict continued.“I am on my way to Malaysia, where I will sign the great Peace Deal, which I proudly brokered between Cambodia and Thailand,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump will later join key leaders at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who will seek to deepen partnerships with the US. He will meet with Japan’s new, conservative prime minister in Tokyo. Trade and security are on the agenda as he meets with the South Korean president.But all eyes are on the expected meeting with Xi in South Korea, which has already been colored by questions of whether it will even happen. The prospect of a potential meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — with whom he shared an infamous 2019 handshake in the Korean Peninsula’s demilitarized zone — also looms over the trip.Trump’s engagements with his counterparts will be closely watched for any progress toward repairing economic ties, expanding trade and making good on investment promises — and whether he can tap into the influence of regional leaders to help expand security cooperation.“All of these leaders and countries (are) going to have been subject to US reciprocal tariffs, pressure to spend more on defense — a bit of bullying by the United States,” said Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS.“But in spite of this, the reception, I think, will be positive. Everybody still wants to cut a deal with the US president,” Cha noted, pointing to those nations’ desires for tariff relief.And, as with any presidential trip abroad, the stagecraft will be meticulously managed as each of Trump’s hosts tries to flatter the American president with pomp and circumstance.Trump and Xi met face-to-face five times during the American president’s first term, including a Mar-a-Lago welcome for Xi and a Trump trip to Beijing.But the circumstances of their most recent in-person meeting, in June 2019 on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Japan, underscore the complicated relationship that persists six years later, after the Covid-19 pandemic and the administration of President Joe Biden.At the time, the US and China were seeking a trade deal amid major tariff escalations by both countries. Though Trump and Xi described that June meeting positively, both countries continued to lash out with further tariff threats and had on-and-off negotiations.Trump has long heralded Xi’s leadership and touted a warm relationship with his counterpart, whom he’s described both as a “friend” and “extremely hard to make a deal with.”And Beijing is seeking some predictability from Trump, who notoriously conducts a capricious brand of diplomacy.This time, the lead-up to their expected meeting has had plenty of twists and turns, with trade tensions reigniting recently after Beijing announced plans to restrict exports of rare earth minerals. Trump then threatened to impose tariffs starting at 130% on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the current 30% minimum rate. Trump also said he’s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as “any and all critical software” to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate against all these actions. China has also paused purchases of American soybeans, causing a strain on US farmers.Earlier this month, Trump threatened to call off the meeting, writing on Truth Social: “I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”But an optimistic Trump on Wednesday indicated he’s heading into talks in dealmaking mode.“I think we’ll make a deal. I think we’re going to make a deal on — the rare earth is the least of it. … I think we’re going to make a deal on soybeans and the farmers. I think we’re going to make a deal on maybe even nuclear,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.Top US and Chinese officials’ trade talks in Malaysia this weekend will set the stage for the president’s talks with Xi. But speaking to Fox Business before the trip, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declined to rule out further escalatory measures if a pause or relief on Beijing’s rare earths regime can’t be negotiated.Ambassador Nicholas Burns, who served in the top US diplomatic post in Beijing during the Biden administration, predicted that Trump and Xi could reach a nontraditional deal during their talks. He cast such a negotiation as “a series of commitments without binding language,” pointing to potential areas of agreement on TikTok, fentanyl and soybean exports.“My best sense is that we’re not going to see a finished trade deal next week. Too little time,” Burns said in a conversation previewing the trip with the Atlantic Council. “The best we can expect,” he said, is the two leaders agreeing on “certain principles” that their aides can follow up on.And Dr. Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economics program, tempered expectations for some of the more intractable disagreements between Washington and Beijing, suggesting that Trump and Xi will reach agreements on “deescalations, rather than solving the underlying systemic issues.”But Trump is also hoping to lean on his meeting with Xi to massage another key relationship recently on the rocks.“I think he can have a big influence on Putin. … Look, he’s a respected man. He’s a very strong leader of a very big country,” Trump said in previewing talks about how to end the war in Ukraine.China has deep economic ties to Russia, and the countries’ leaders have shown solidarity in recent months, which raises a key test for Trump and the American influence he’s trying to project around the world.Trump will also have the opportunity to meet with staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi, who became Japan’s first female prime minister earlier this month.Like the late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Trump developed a close relationship during his first term, she supports revising Japan’s pacifist constitution and has visited a controversial war shrine that includes the names of those convicted of war crimes during World War II — both issues that spark anger in neighboring China and South Korea. She also opposes same-sex marriage and a growing movement to allow Japanese married couples to use separate surnames.Trump praised her as a “highly respected person of great wisdom and strength” in a Truth Social post after her election. But the leaders’ interactions — and whether they can cultivate the same warm ties Trump enjoyed with Abe — will be closely watched.But for Trump, it’s not just friendship that matters — it’s also economic deals. He’s likely to highlight Japan’s commitment to invest $550 billion in the US, with Takaichi’s government working to finalize an initial package of purchases, according to Dr. Kristi Govella, Japan chair at CSIS.Trump, who made multiple trips to Japan during his first term, is also expected to be greeted by the country’s emperor, visit with US troops, meet Japanese business leaders and, according to Govella, visit with Abe’s widow, who spent time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last year.Trump will also meet a new leader in South Korea, where trade and security are high priorities for talks with President Lee Jae Myung, who assumed office in June after a tumultuous political moment for his country as his predecessor declared martial law.Since then, South Korea and the US have unveiled a new trade deal, which called for 15% tariffs on goods from the country and a massive $350 billion investment in the US. The trade agreement has not gone into effect, and Trump’s tariffs have placed significant strain on the South Korean economy.The US-South Korean relationship also faced a major test in September when nearly 500 people, mostly South Korean nationals, were arrested and detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in the US state of Georgia, sparking outrage back home. Lee openly expressed concern about the future of South Korean investment in the US, saying that confusion over the visa situation for South Koreans would lead local companies to question “whether they should go at all.”But Lee has sounded optimistic ahead of his meeting with the US president.“I believe that is taking some time. And I also believe in the rationality of the United States. And so I believe that we will be able to reach a rational agreement,” he told CNN’s Will Ripley.“I believe that in the end, we will be able to reach a rational result that is acceptable. Because we are an alliance — and we both have common sense and rationality,” he added.Regional tensions are also at the forefront this week, with Lee eying Trump’s “peacemaker” abilities. The president’s trip, which coincides with the APEC economic summit, comes just days after South Korea’s northern neighbor offered its latest provocation, test-firing ballistic missiles — North Korea’s first military show of force since Lee took office.“I also believe that President Trump wants to achieve world peace. That’s why I have asked him to take on the role of peacemaker,” Lee told CNN, saying he’d welcome the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting.Trump administration officials have privately discussed setting up a meeting between the US president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during this trip, though many are skeptical it will ultimately happen, sources familiar with the matter told CNN earlier this month.Trump has publicly and privately expressed a desire to meet his North Korean counterpart, and officials have left the door open to a meeting during the trip, even if there hasn’t been any of the communications between Washington and Pyongyang that Trump at times had during his first term.“They have a lot of nuclear weapons, but not a lot of telephone service. So I’m open to it. I had a great relationship with him, and he probably knows I’m coming, right? But if you want to put out the word, I’m open to it,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether he’d see Kim.In June 2019, Trump became the first sitting US president to step into North Korea, a brief but historic moment that came together quickly after the president tweeted an invitation. The leaders met for nearly an hour at the demilitarized zone — but the meeting did not yield substantial progress, and North Korea has subsequently bolstered its nuclear weapons program.Trump is expected to meet with other key counterparts in Kuala Lumpur, including Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and leaders from the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries where the US is seeking to build influence.But leaders in each nation have grappled with instability during the US president’s second term — as well as impacts from the administration’s cuts to foreign aid.CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald, Jessie Yeung, Hanako Montgomery, Will Ripley, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood and John Liu contributed to this report.© 2025 Cable News Network.

He’s being decisive.”Mbappe struggled for confidence and form in his early days at Madrid with his first Clasico a huge disappointment.Exactly a year before this weekend’s Clasico, Barcelona visited the Bernabeu and came away with a 4-0 victory, a match notable for the French superstar’s struggle to beat the Catalans’ high defensive line in his first outing against them for Madrid.Mbappe had one goal disallowed for offside and was caught offside eight times in total. The forward was “shrunken and without venom”, the Spanish newspaper AS wrote.“It’s time to change my situation and show who I am as a player,” Mbappe pledged a few weeks later as Madrid continued to slump.By the time Mbappe next faced Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in January, he had clicked into a higher gear.Madrid were dismantled 5-2, but Mbappe found the net, as he did in their far tighter 3-2 Copa del Rey final defeat.In May Mbappe, now in full flow, hit a hat-trick against Barcelona, but Los Blancos still fell 4-3 at the Olympic stadium as Flick’s side virtually wrapped up the league title.This time last year... pic.twitter.com/QCXkedaq5K— LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN) October 24, 2025This season, Turkish playmaker Arda Guler has started to form a strong connection with Mbappe, having a knack for spotting the forward’s bursts behind the defence.“Arda gets between the lines, and there he finds Mbappe well,” Alonso explained.With Barcelona struggling badly in defence at the start of the current campaign, Madrid are confident Mbappe will be able to get in behind to devastating effect on Sunday.Teenage winger Lamine Yamal has been in the spotlight in the Spanish capital after joking during an appearance on a social media stream that Real Madrid “steal” and “complain”.Barcelona’s assistant coach said on Saturday, however, that the furore created could go the way of the youngster.“Lamine is a top player, and I think [the criticism] will be motivating for him,” Marcus Sorg, Flick’s assistant, said at a news conference.“I hope we all see him [give] the best performance.”The 18-year-old Spain international will be up against Madrid left back Alvaro Carreras, whom he struggled against at times last season for Benfica on three occasions they faced Barcelona in the Champions League.“Lamine is always motivated, and if I remember right, we won all three games against Benfica,” Sorg noted.Flick is suspended for the game after a red card last weekend during the win over Girona, and Sorg is taking over duties on the touchline.“Honestly, Hansi is missing always if he is not there because he’s the most important part of the team,” Sorg said.“It’s a disadvantage of course, [but] it’s the same as [missing] players. We have to deal with it. Everyone knows what he expects, and I think we will do it.”Barcelona will be without winger Raphinha, who has suffered a setback in his return from a hamstring injury.“Raphinha – every team would miss him, but it is how it is. We have enough players and have to deal with it,” Sorg said.This is the 262nd Clasico with Real claiming 105 wins and Barcelona taking the spoils on 104 occasions.Real Madrid hope to welcome back Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Dani Ceballos and Dean Huijsen. Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba are out due to muscle and groin injuries.Frenkie de Jong has returned from illness, but Jules Kounde is a doubt due to a slight knock.Raphinha’s hamstring injury is keeping him sidelined while Joan Garcia, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Gavi, Robert Lewandowski and Dani Olmo are all confirmed absentees.Courtois; Valverde, Militao, Asencio, Carreras; Guler, Tchouameni, Bellingham; Mastantuono, Mbappe, ViniciusSzczesny; E Garcia, Araujo, Cubarsi, Balde; Pedri, de Jong; Yamal, Fermin, Rashford; FerranFollow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Can Real-deal Mbappe end Barca’s four-Clasico winning streak?

China controls about 90% of the world’s processed output of critical minerals, which are essential to global supply chains for consumer electronics, automobiles and semiconductors.Shocked by Beijing’s actions, Trump vowed to impose an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and export controls on “any and all critical software” starting next month. At one stage, he even threatened to cancel the meeting with Xi.The measures, ranging from tech and rare earth restrictions, are expected to be major points of contention during the talks.Before Bessent’s departure for Malaysia on Wednesday, he told Fox Business that he is “optimistic” about the upcoming talks but does not rule out further escalatory measures if a pause or relief on Beijing’s rare earths regime can’t be negotiated.“I’m hoping that we can get this ironed out this weekend so that the leaders can enter their talks on a more positive note,” he said, downplaying the Trump-Xi summit as a “pull-aside.”Reuters first reported this week that the Trump administration is considering upping the ante further with a wide array of software export restrictions spanning laptops to jet engines.When asked about the potential for additional curbs on China on Wednesday, Bessent said “everything is on the table.”“If these export controls – whether it’s software, engines or other things - happen, it will likely be in coordination with our G7 allies,” he said.China’s commerce ministry said Thursday that the two sides will discuss “key issues” in accordance with the “important consensuses reached during recent phone conversations between Xi and Trump,” without elaborating further.The leaders last spoke in mid-September following trade negotiations in Madrid led by Bessent and Li Chenggang, China’s vice minister of commerce. Trump then lauded the progress made to finalize a deal to sell TikTok’s US assets to American investors, as well as developments on trade, the illegal flow of drugs, and Russia’s war in Ukraine.At a news conference Friday, China’s commerce minister Wang Wentao urged further dialogues to “identify the right way to coexist” and stressed that China has consistently opposed decoupling.“The first four rounds of China-US economic and trade consultations have fully demonstrated that, on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultation, the two sides are fully capable of finding ways to address each other’s concerns,” he said.Despite Trump’s suggestions of a swift and successful deal with China, and multiple rounds of talks throughout the year, the standoff between the two countries has instead taken a turbulent course.In April, the tit-for-tat tariff offensive resulted in taxes on each country’s goods rising to triple-digit levels. Beijing also announced an unprecedented licensing regime to restrict the export of certain rare earths, which disrupted global productions of automobiles among others.A 90-day trade truce was brokered by Bessent and Greer’s first meeting with He in Geneva in May, reducing the sky-high levy to double digits. They subsequently met in London and Stockholm to extend the trade truce and speed up the flow of rare earths, before meeting in Madrid last month.At one point, the talks turned personal, with Bessent accusing Li, also a key negotiator in the previous rounds of trade talks, of being “very disrespectful” and “slightly unhinged.” Neither Li nor the Chinese commerce ministry has responded to this accusation.Issues dominating the weekend talks in Malaysia are also likely to feature in the much-hyped summit between Trump and Xi in the upcoming week on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).“We’ll make a deal on, I think, everything,” Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval office. “We’re going to make a deal on the rare earth.”The American president said he also expects to strike a deal on soybeans and discuss Russia’s war in Ukraine. Once the largest importer of American soybeans, China paused purchases of the product in May as bilateral frictions intensified.“What I’ll really be talking to him about is, how do we end the war with Russia and Ukraine, whether it’s through oil or energy or anything else. And I think he’s going to be very receptive,” Trump said of Xi.Trump will depart the US Friday evening for his first trip to Asia in his second term, with stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea.On Sunday, Trump will meet with Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister of Malaysia, which is hosting this year’s summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), before attending the ASEAN leaders working dinner. He is then due to meet the newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in Tokyo on Tuesday.The visit will be followed by a Wednesday meeting with South Korea President Lee Jae Myung in Busan. He will then deliver remarks at a luncheon for the APEC CEO summit and participate in a US-APEC leaders working dinner.CNN’s Donald Judd and Joyce Jiang contributed to this report.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

He ate a bit of food and then went out to watch the birds, as he liked to do.A child, excited by the simple things, and curious about the world around him.Muhammad came home, messed around with some olives, and then went out again to play football. This time, the fourth-grader didn’t come back.At the grocery store, Alia received a phone call.“It was my uncle Ahmad calling, asking if there were any clashes [with Israeli forces] in our area,” she recounted. “I screamed unconsciously. ‘My son Muhammad, my son Muhammad!’ I don’t know why, but a mother’s instincts are always right.”Muhammad’s eldest sister, 14-year-old Mais, heard the gunfire in the evening and rushed outside.Both Mais and Alia were originally told their boy had been injured.Alia headed for the local hospital and was told that her boy had been hit by a bullet.“They said his condition was good and that they would remove the bullet,” Alia said. But then she started hearing whispers about his pulse stopping. She wanted to see Muhammad, but wasn’t allowed in the operating theatre, as surgeons desperately tried to save the boy’s life.Then Alia heard the heart monitor give a long, piercing beep. Muhammad was dead, killed by Israeli forces operating in his village.“Muhammad was gone,” Alia said. “And with him, everything good.”Commenting on Muhammad’s killing by Israeli forces, the United Nations Human Rights Office in the occupied Palestinian territory said it was “appalled”. The UN office added that Muhammed was the 1,001st Palestinian to be killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023, including 213 children.The UN said that the youngest child killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank was two-year-old Laila Khatib, who was shot in her home in Jenin in January during an Israeli raid.“International standards require Israel to ensure an independent and effective investigation of all incidents where individuals have been killed in violent or suspicious circumstances,” the UN office said. “The large numbers of Palestinians killed in this period, the prevalence of the unlawful use of force, the enabling and support for settler violence and the endemic impunity for crimes committed against Palestinians, all suggest that Israeli [forces] use lethal and potentially lethal force as a tool to control and repress Palestinians, rather than as the last resort to restore and maintain public order and civil life for the Palestinians.”Muhammad and his friends are believed to have run when they saw Israeli military vehicles in their vicinity, before Israeli soldiers began shooting.An initial statement from the Israeli military said that its forces were responding to suspects throwing rocks – although no local reports indicate that had happened, or that Muhammad and his friends were involved. Israeli media have since reported that a preliminary military investigation had found that the shooting “deviated from the rules of engagement”, and that there had been “improper use of weaponry”.Israeli soldiers rarely face repercussions for carrying out killings of Palestinians in the West Bank, with towns and villages like al-Rihiya instead left to pick up the pieces after tragedies like Muhammad’s death.He was the third of five siblings – aside from Mais, the eldest, there is Jaddi, who is 12, six-year-old Sila, and four-year-old Elias.Muhammad’s absence is heartbreaking for them all.The white robe he wore for Friday prayers still lies neatly folded beside his bed, next to a small bottle of perfume. His books are stacked where he left them.“This is where Muhammad slept,” Alia said, as she pointed to the empty space. “They killed his childhood.”His family are struggling to deal with Muhammad’s death in their own ways. Sila refuses to go back to school – her brother always walked alongside her.Mais said that she collapsed when she heard that Muhammad had died.“Muhammad wasn’t just a brother, he was my friend,” she said. “When he came home from school, he would ask me to tutor him, and if I got busy, he would get angry and say ‘teach me first’. I was afraid of sleeping in the dark, so he would stay with me until I fell asleep, then he would go to sleep.”The bag Muhammad received on his final school day still hangs on a nail near his bed.His father, Bahjat, finds himself walking by the bag and around the room, touching his bed, breathing in the scent of his clothes.“His passing left a huge void,” said Bahjat. “I see him in every corner of the house: at the dining table, in his study and the play area.”“I still can’t believe he’s gone,” Mais said. “I imagine him in heaven, playing, laughing, and having fun just like he used to. I still can’t believe he’s gone … and I never will.”Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"‘They killed his childhood’: West Bank family mourn child killed by Israel","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/10/25/they-killed-his-childhood-west-bank-family-mourn-child-killed-israel","message":""},{"details":"Chinese leaders have just concluded a closed-door conclave focused on drawing up the country’s next five-year economic blueprint – a sweeping plan covering everything from accelerating tech innovation to streamlining how China’s farms grow food.Stakes are high for formulating that strategy, with Chinese officials under pressure to reduce reliance on imported technology and address economic weaknesses as the country faces a deepening rivalry with the US.But drawing up the plan – especially at a moment when Washington remains immobilized by a government shutdown over spending for the current fiscal year – also gives leader Xi Jinping an opportunity to showcase a source of his confidence in China’s rise: the authoritarian country’s ability to produce – and deliver on – far-reaching visions.Chinese state media and officials have not been delicate about playing up what they see as that competitive advantage in recent days.“Scientifically formulating and continuously implementing the five-year plan is … a key political advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Many foreign political parties envy us for this,” Jiang Jinquan, an official with the Communist Party Central Committee’s Policy Research Office, said at a press briefing Friday, adding that such plans were essential for “gaining strategic initiative in the midst of intense international competition.”A commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily published Thursday praised how China “views the whole country as one chessboard… and continues to advance steadily along the correct direction,” while “some countries remain trapped in the shortsightedness and constant policy reversals under multiparty systems.”“Long-termism,” a blend of continuity and flexibility, is something “Western countries find difficult to match,” another article, in state media agency Xinhua, quoted Tsinghua University professor Yan Yilong as saying.A separate commentary published by Beijing Daily, meanwhile, spotlighted the “out of control” situation in the US, pointing to the “No Kings” protests, the government shutdown, and a controversial AI-generated video meme shared by US President Donald Trump last weekend.It concluded: “The (American) halo is illusory, and the myth is fragile. To use Trump’s own words: The United States has become a failed state in many ways and is ‘dying from within.’”Such rhetoric is, of course, not unusual within China’s tightly controlled propaganda environment. And officials have long looked to play up the ills of other countries, especially the US, to boost their own image for domestic and, increasingly, international audiences.But the sentiment also reflects the thinking of the country’s ruling Communist Party – and its leader Xi – at a moment when the two countries are sparring over tech and trade as they grapple with how to structure their economic relationship and rivalry.And the chance to amplify that sentiment, through the pomp of crafting the upcoming five-year plan, couldn’t come at a better moment for Xi, days ahead of a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea, and weeks after China reignited US ire by expanding its rare earths export control regime.Full details of the upcoming five-year plan will not be released until after its approval by China’s rubber-stamp legislature in March. But an overview of the priorities approved by a powerful Communist Party committee that met over four days this week exuded confidence in China’s continued rise.“We will strive for another five years to achieve a significant leap forward in our country’s economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength, comprehensive national power, and international influence by 2035,” a communique released by state media Thursday said.Officials would “accelerate the development of building China’s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.”Leaders signaled they would stay the course on “accelerating high-level scientific and technological self-reliance” and infusing high tech into industry – building on China’s current efforts to upgrade its manufacturing and capacity to innovate.“The proposals advocate for a forward-looking layout for future industries, promoting quantum technology, biotechnology, hydrogen energy, nuclear fusion, brain-computer interfaces, embodied intelligence, and sixth-generation mobile communications as new drivers of economic growth,” Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Friday.The signaling following the meeting in Beijing suggested China would double down on its position as a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse, despite longstanding views from some analysts that it should transition to a services-driven economy as many developed economies have. The communique also stressed the importance of national security and the need to “accelerate the building of advanced combat capabilities” for the military.Officials pointed to efforts to address challenges like flagging domestic consumption, socioeconomic inequality and “involution” – or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. China would “vigorously boost consumption” and “improve the social security system,” as well as further opening China’s market to international players, according to the communique.How officials precisely plan to achieve these goals will only become clearer over the coming months and years.Observers have long noted the ability of China’s tightly controlled system to achieve far-reaching goals.The country has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, transformed into the world’s second-largest economy and a global growth engine, and more recently emerged as a technological powerhouse and a proponent of the green transition across the world.And as the US shakes up its own foreign and domestic policy under Trump, Beijing is also touting China’s planning as proof that it, not the US, is a responsible global leader.“In today’s global environment, some major powers frequently change their policies, and such ‘unpredictability’ has cast a shadow over world peace and development,” an editorial in state-backed tabloid Global Times published Friday said.“The development roadmap unveiled in the communique for China’s next five years offers the world something truly rare in these turbulent times – certainty,” it added.Chinese electric cars are going global. A cut-throat price war at home could kill off many of its brandsUnlike in Western democracies, where visions for a country are articulated by leaders elected by popular vote – and can often be voted down by opposition lawmakers – China’s five-year plans are crafted in the upper echelons of the Communist Party, ostensibly with what Beijing calls “mass consultation” with various sectors of society. Xi sits “at the helm” of this process, according to state media.Once set, five-year plans act as marching orders for officials across the sprawling apparatus of the government and a guide for businesses, universities and other organizations on how to align their own strategies with the party’s.Such plans have at times had disastrous consequences. The “Great Leap Forward” associated with the second five-year plan of 1958, that was supposed to drive China’s industrialization, instead drove the country into famine, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.More recently, plans have spurred China’s energetic efforts to build out new industries like green technology and electric vehicles and upgrade factory production, but also shown some of the drawbacks of state-backed planning.Take EVs, for example. China now dominates the sector globally, yet state support has also created artificial market saturation, driving price wars and an ongoing wave of company failures.But for Xi, who is determined not to see China’s rise hindered by Western export controls and trade barriers, it’s clear that the power to chart out a vision, to deliver with a deadline in 2030, underlines his faith that his system will ultimately win out.Or in his own words, as recently quoted in state media, when it comes to China’s “revitalization,” this planning creates “a vital political advantage.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

The Department of Agriculture told states in an October 10 letter that if the shutdown continues, the programme would run out of money to pay for benefits in November.President Donald Trump’s Republican administration is blaming the Democrats with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins repeating a false healthcare talking point on October 16 on X: “Democrats are putting free health care for illegal aliens and their political agenda ahead of food security for American families. Shameful.”The government shutdown stems from disagreements between Democrats – who want Congress, as part of approving federal funding, to extend expiring enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), through which uninsured Americans can buy health insurance – and Republicans, who want to extend federal funding first before negotiating over whether or how to extend the ACA subsidies.SNAP is a federal programme operated by state agencies. Participants receive an average individual monthly benefit of about $190 or $356 per household. Recipients may use the benefits to buy fruit, vegetables, meat, dairy products, bread and other foods. The majority of SNAP households live in poverty.Lawmakers and social media users have made several statements about SNAP with varying degrees of accuracy about the shutdown and the Republican tax and spending law that Trump signed in July. Here’s a closer look:Many social media posts have said food stamps are going away as soon as November 1.“Let that sink in – just in time for the cold season and the month of giving thanks,” one Instagram post said.That could happen for millions of people. But it might not happen for all of them, and it could happen throughout the month of November because the monthly date when people receive their benefits varies by state.The Trump administration could use SNAP’s contingency fund to pay for nearly two-thirds of a full month of benefits, or it could transfer other Agriculture Department funds, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The administration has said it has found funding to continue the Women, Infants and Children programme, another food programme for low-income families.According to an Agriculture Department funding lapse plan, SNAP “shall continue operations during a lapse in appropriations, subject to the availability of funding”.An Agriculture Department letter told states to hold off on steps that would lead to people receiving their November benefits. Federal regulations require that reductions be made in a way that higher-income recipients lose more benefits than the lowest-income recipients.We asked administration officials for more detail but received no response to our questions.Many state officials – including in Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin – said that if the shutdown continues, participants might not or will not receive benefits in November. A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Children and Families told PolitiFact that if the shutdown continues into November, benefits will not be issued.California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday that he will deploy the National Guard and California Volunteers, a state agency, to support food banks and provide $80m in state money.“Empty cupboards and stomachs are not abstract outcomes,” Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers told Rollins in a Wednesday letter. “They are the very real and near consequences of the dysfunction in Washington. These are also consequences you can prevent today.”Meanwhile, food banks across the country have taken a hit from other Trump administration policies. ProPublica reported on October 3 that earlier in the year, the administration cut $500m in deliveries through the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides food to state distribution agencies.So what have key lawmakers said on this issue and how true are their claims?– Mike Johnson, speaker of the US House of Representatives, on the TV programme Face the Nation on May 25This is false.Johnson spoke after the House passed a Republican-backed bill known at the time as the One Big Beautiful Bill, which included many of Trump’s policy priorities.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, estimated in May that 3.2 million fewer people per month on average would receive SNAP benefits over the next nine years based on the bill’s changes to work requirements and restrictions on states’ ability to waive the work requirements in areas with high unemployment.A more recent August CBO analysis estimated the changes would reduce participation in SNAP by roughly 2.4 million people.– Wisconsin state Representative Francesca Hong in a June 12 X postThis is true.In a series of X posts, Hong said it wouldn’t be only families receiving food aid that would be hurt by the legislation.A chart published this year by the Agriculture Department’s Economic Research Service showed that in 2023, farm establishments made 24.3 cents of every dollar spent on food at home, including at grocery stores and supermarkets.– House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries at a May 8 news conferenceThis is mostly false.An April 2 study found that 8 percent of veterans rely on SNAP benefits. No state had a share higher than 14 percent. Studies with data from a few years earlier showed rates from 4.9 percent to 6.6 percent.Louis Jacobson, Staff Writer Loreben Tuquero and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Madeline Heim contributed to this article.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Will millions of low-income Americans lose food stamps during shutdown?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/25/will-millions-of-low-income-americans-lose-food-stamps-during-shutdown","message":""},{"details":"BBC Travel Presenter Qasa Alom heads to Rome as Italy's capital celebrates its Jubilee Year and finds a city planning for ambitious modernisation, whilst trying to preserve its ancient roots.This video is from The Travel Show, the BBC's flagship travel programme.The actress reveals that she dug through her trash when her co-star came over hungry one night.A mysterious 1892 death at a California hotel sparked ghost stories that still intrigue visitors today.Rollercoasters send our hearts racing and stomachs dropping.

Three Palestinians were injured in those attacks before being forced off their land.More than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in more than 250 settlements and settlement outposts – considered illegal under international law – across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.They have targeted Palestinian property more than 2,400 times in the last two years, displacing at least 3,055 people, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"‘Armed, dangerous’: Israeli settlers attack Palestinians harvesting olives","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/israeli-settlers-attack-more-palestinians-as-olive-harvest-violence-surges","message":""},{"details":"Audrey Eckert from Nebraska was named Miss USA on Friday, as the scandal-hit annual pageant returned under new ownership.The 22-year-old digital safety advocate beat 50 other contestants to claim the crown at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada. Ivy Harrington from New Jersey and Chantéa McIntyre from Oregon were named first and second runners-up.The event capped almost 18 months of turbulence for the long-running contest, which underwent an acrimonious change in leadership following the resignation of Miss USA 2023, Utah’s Noelia Voigt, amid allegations of mistreatment.With the event’s new organizers heralding a “new era,” Friday’s finale concluded five days of events spanning swimwear competitions, eveningwear parades and Q&As with judges.Eckert, a former cheerleader and graduate of University of Nebraska-Lincoln, fell to her knees when her victory was announced, overcome with emotion in a blizzard of gold streamers.In a break from tradition, she was crowned by reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjær Theilvig rather than by last year’s winner, Alma Cooper of Michigan, who was not in attendance. Voigt meanwhile made a surprise return to the pageant as a host for the official online broadcast, having co-hosted one of the preliminary competitions on Wednesday.The Miss USA pageant was plunged into controversy last May, when Voigt and then-reigning Miss Teen USA, UmaSofia Srivastava, resigned within days of one another. Voigt initially attributed her decision to mental health concerns, but social media users spotted that the first letters of the first 11 sentences of her cryptic post spelled “I am silenced,” sparking rumors of a strict non-disclosure agreement.Her resignation letter, later seen by CNN, alleged a “toxic work environment” that “at best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.” Voigt also claimed the pageant’s organizers had failed to provide an “effective handler,” resulting in her being sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Florida while alone with an unnamed person in a car. Miss USA’s then president, Laylah Rose, has consistently denied allegations of wrongdoing.Last month, American businessman Thom Brodeur announced he had acquired the rights to Miss USA and Miss Teen USA from the Miss Universe Organization, which controls both licenses. The 10-year deal sees him assume the role of Miss USA’s president and CEO, but Rose – still posting via the pageant’s official Instagram account – rejected this, writing in a since-deleted post that she had not seen “any new contracts regarding any transfer of ownership.”The Miss Universe Organization later issued a statement confirming Brodeur’s acquisition, calling it a “new chapter” in the pageant’s “storied history.” Miss Universe’s co-owner JKN Global Group then filed a lawsuit against Rose’s company VVV Global, alleging the firm had breached its contract and brought the Miss USA brand “into disrepute.” The suit also reiterated Voigt’s earlier claims, while accusing Rose of “mistreating pageant contestants, winners, staff and volunteers.”In a statement, emailed to CNN by Rose, VVV Global said it was still “committed to the pageant world” and “eager to obtain a full 12-year license agreement for the … pageants as promised from JKN.” The company has also filed a countersuit denying allegations of wrongdoing, while claiming over $116 million in damages and lost profits.About a week after JKN’s complaint was filed, Brodeur wrote on Instagram that he had “officially regained access” to Miss USA’s social media accounts. The businessman and founder of Brodeur Beauty declined CNN’s request for comment on his vision for the pageant, though he has previously attempted to draw a line under recent events. Speaking to People magazine last month about Voight Voigt and Srivastava’s resignations, he said: “There was some pretty egregious NDA language that suppressed the voices of those two young women and did not give them the ability to speak about their journey. I want to remove that restriction.”Founded in 1952, the Miss USA organization has undergone multiple changes in leadership in recent years. Donald Trump owned the pageant, as well as the Miss Universe Organization, from 1996 to 2015, when he sold both to WME-IMG. JKN Global Group, a conglomerate founded by Thai businesswoman Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, acquired both Miss Universe and Miss USA in 2022.Prior to Rose’s appointment, former Miss USA Crystle Stewart had operated the American pageant’s license, though she stepped down after becoming embroiled in a scandal that included claims of favoritism toward the 2022 winner R’Bonney Gabriel. (Gabriel later went on to win Miss Universe.) Stewart denied allegations that the pageant was rigged, and an internal investigation concluded no rigging took place.This year’s contest began Monday with a “state costume” competition, won by Miss Missouri, Shae Smith. Other preliminary contests and closed-door interviews saw the 51 contestants narrowed down to a top 16, with a further four advancing to the final through a public vote.During an on-stage Q&A with judges — including 2014’s Miss USA, and star of “The Valley,” Nia Sanchez — contestants fielded questions on topics ranging from representation in the media to the future of artificial intelligence.More than a dozen of this year’s participants were aged 30 or above, after Miss USA lifted longstanding rules in 2024 banning women aged over 28 (as well as married women and mothers) from entering. Among them was 44-year-old Miss Delaware, Tetra Shockley, who became the oldest person ever to compete in the pageant. Miss New Hampshire, MonaLesa Brackett, meanwhile became the first woman to compete wearing a hijab.Friday’s pageant also marked the first time Miss USA has not been televised since it was first broadcast on CBS in 1963. It was instead broadcast via a specialist beauty and pageantry streaming service.Eckert will now go on to compete at the 74th Miss Universe pageant in Thailand next month. The USA is the most successful country in the contest’s history, with nine American entrants going on to claim the title in its 73-year history.On Thursday night, meanwhile, high school student and aspiring dermatologist Mailyn Marsh, of Missouri, was named this year’s Miss Teen USA, a companion title for contestants aged 14 to 19.© 2025 Cable News Network.

Together, they have a population of 678 million people and a gross domestic product of $3.9 trillion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.This year, ASEAN will induct its 11th member, East Timor. The country gained independence from Indonesia in 2002 and is home to 1.4 million people.The summit will bring together leaders from every country in the bloc except for Myanmar’s acting president, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.The ASEAN summit is accompanied annually by the East Asia Summit, a gathering of leaders of the ASEAN nations, the US, China, India, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.This year, US President Donald Trump, Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon will be attending.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak will represent Moscow while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take part virtually.Beyond the leaders of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit nations, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in Kuala Lumpur too.The heads of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labour Organization and the International Federation of Association Football, better known as FIFA, will also attend some sessions, according to Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency.Apart from the ASEAN summit and the East Asia Summit, ASEAN will also hold separate conclaves with leaders of key powers in Kuala Lumpur.There’s also a peace deal to be signed on Sunday when Cambodia and Thailand ink a pact to end a deadly border dispute. The ceremony will be presided over by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, according to Bernama.The long-running border conflict rekindled in July when dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced along the border. A ceasefire was reached after five days with the help of Malaysia, China and the US.Despite the high-profile nature of the event, some critics have questioned whether the deal will be more of a photo-op for Trump than a lasting resolution. Ceasefire violations have continued since July while the original issue around border demarcation has also not been resolved, according to Mu Sochua, a former Cambodian opposition leader and president of the Khmer Movement for Democracy.She told Al Jazeera the threat of tariffs from Trump helped bring Thailand and Cambodia to the negotiating table in a move that was effective in the short term but also controversial. “Critics in both countries say it amounted to economic blackmail – trading peace for trade benefits rather than addressing justice, sovereignty or local needs,” she said.The ASEAN summit will discuss pressing issues like US tariffs and access to rare earth minerals, which are essential to high-tech manufacturing and whose production is dominated by China.Trump launched his “Liberation Day Tariffs” in April against most US trading partners in a bid to lower the US trade deficit. After much negotiation, US tariffs for most ASEAN countries range from 10 to 20 percent while Brunei’s tariff rate is 25 percent. Tariffs for Laos and Myanmar are both 40 percent.In response to Trump’s tariffs, China has tightened export restrictions on rare earths, a move that has been felt around the world.Marco Foster, ASEAN director at the professional services firm Dezan Shira & Associates, told Al Jazeera that most attendees will be vying for a chance to speak to Trump about tariffs. “Pretty much everyone is going to be going after him or trying to get in the room with him or his people to talk about their deal,” he said. “Everyone will want to have a sideline meeting with Trump.”Attendees are also expected to discuss pressing issues like Myanmar’s civil war and the proliferation of scam centres in Southeast Asia, which have earned criminal networks tens of billions of dollars.Myanmar’s acting president will not attend the ASEAN summit, and Myanmar will not take the helm from Malaysia as next year’s ASEAN chair because it has been embroiled in a civil war since 2021. Instead, the role will fall to the Philippines.In 2021, ASEAN issued a Five-Point Consensus, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Myanmar and humanitarian assistance while creating a special ASEAN envoy to help mediate the conflict. Four years later, critics said it has had little impact on the crisis.Charles Santiago, co-chairman of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, told Al Jazeera that he expected Myanmar and the fallout from the civil war to be discussed at the summit.“Myanmar has become a destabilising factor, both [in terms of] security and social cohesion in the other parts of Southeast Asia,” he said. The civil war has facilitated the spread of the flow of drugs and weapons while creating a refugee crisis, he added.Still, Santiago said he did not expect much to come from the ASEAN summit. “This will be a major photo opportunity for everybody,” he said, but “nothing much will happen” in terms of policy.ASEAN has sometimes been criticised for lacking an enforcement mechanism to force members to abide by its rulings. This makes it different from other regional blocs like the European Union, whose members must abide by EU laws and rulings.It’s a criticism that has been heard recently around issues like Myanmar as well as the Cambodian-Thai border conflict.Foster said this feature is a legacy of ASEAN’s unique history. The organisation was founded in 1967 after a major wave of decolonisation around the world.

Ten days had passed since the “ceasefire” was announced and I thought it must finally be safe for me to go out. Venturing out was supposed to be a step towards reclaiming a small part of my old life.My brother and I were almost at the cafe when we heard a very familiar sound – the thunder of an explosion. An Israeli drone had hit the entrance of Twix Cafe.I froze. I thought, this is it – it’s my turn. I won’t survive this war.Three people were killed and several others were injured. Had my brother and I left my family’s tent a few minutes earlier, we, too, may have been among the casualties.As the news spread, my family went into panic, calling us over and over again. The signal was weak, and their attempts to reach us were failing. We were able to comfort our mum only when we got back to the tent.I asked myself, what kind of “ceasefire” is this? I felt more anger than fear.When the ceasefire agreement came into effect and we were told by foreign leaders that the war was over, many of us dared to hope. We thought the explosions would finally stop, that we could begin to rebuild our shattered lives without fear.But there is no such hope under Israeli occupation. The violence never truly ends. That day, when the Israeli army bombed Twix Cafe, it also bombed dozens of other places throughout the Gaza Strip, killing at least 45 people and injuring many more.It was the single deadliest day since the ceasefire took effect. No day has passed without casualties; Israel continues to kill every day. By now, more than 100 Palestinians have been murdered since the so-called ceasefire was announced.Among them were 11 members of the Abu Shaaban family. The massacre happened on October 18, the day before the mass bombing. The Abu Shaabans were trying to return to their home in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City, riding in one vehicle. An Israeli bomb ended the lives of four adults: Sufian, Samar, Ihab and Randa; and seven children: Karam, aged 10, Anas, eight, Nesma, 12, Nasser, 13, Jumana, 10, Ibrahim, six, and Mohammed, five.This is what Israel calls a “ceasefire”.On Sunday, panic and insecurity spread throughout the Strip as the mass bombardment started. As explosions were going off, people rushed to the markets to secure as much food as they could afford to prepare for the war and starvation resuming.It was heartbreaking to see how, amid the bombs, people’s minds automatically focused on food. It seems we have lost forever the feeling of security, of knowing that tomorrow we will have food on the table.And yes, we are still forced to buy our food because Israel is not only violating the “ceasefire” by bombing us, but also withholding the aid it signed onto allowing. At least 600 trucks of aid were supposed to enter Gaza per day. According to the Gaza Media Office, just 986 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire went into effect on October 11 – just 15 percent of what was promised. The World Food Programme (WFP) counted just 530 of its trucks being allowed in. UNRWA has 6,000 waiting to enter; none has been allowed.Yesterday, the WFP spokesperson said no large aid convoys have entered Gaza City; Israel still does not give the agency the permission to use Salah al-Din Street. The Israeli policy of starving Gaza’s north is still in effect.The Rafah border crossing with Egypt – our only outlet to the rest of the world – remains closed. We don’t know when it will open again; when the thousands of injured people will be allowed to cross for urgent medical treatment; when students will be able to leave to continue their education; when families, torn apart by the war, will be reunited; when those who love Gaza – those who have waited so long to come home – will finally be able to return.It is by now clear that Israel is treating this “ceasefire” like a switch – turning it on and off as it pleases. On Sunday, we were back to massive bombardment, on Monday, it was “ceasefire” again. As if nothing had happened, as though 45 people hadn’t been massacred, as if no homes had been destroyed and no families shattered. It is devastating to see our lives treated as if they do not matter. It is soul-crushing to know that Israel can resume mass murder whenever it wants, without warning, without an excuse.This ceasefire is nothing more than a pause in what we now believe is an endless war – a moment of silence that can end at any moment. We will remain at the mercy of a murderous occupier until the world finally recognises our right to live and takes real action to secure it. Until then, we will remain numbers in headlines about Israel’s endless killing spree.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"We survived the war, we may not survive the ceasefire","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/25/we-survived-the-war-we-may-not-survive-the-ceasefire","message":""},{"details":"A giant mug of instant black coffee and no food is not what you'd expect the host of a wellness podcast to have for breakfast.Yet it's what Dr Chris van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs alongside identical twin brother Dr Xand confesses to having.\"I'm approaching middle age so don't want to eat all day. My way of not eating all day is not eating breakfast,\" he says.It's this kind of honesty about not leading the perfect life and struggling with the stuff they know they should do but still don't, that makes them so relatable.The brothers are both medical doctors who've become household names through their TV and radio work - they present children's series Operation Ouch! and Dr Xand is one of BBC's Morning Live resident experts while Dr Chris is well known for his bestselling book Ultra-Processed People.On the podcast, they often disagree with each other over competing claims about health and wellbeing, much like they do in real life.Xand laughs after Chris says it's a hard job working \"with a brother like Xand who is so intensely annoying\".But really the brothers love working together and Chris admits that they started the podcast \"quite selfishly as we were just trying to answer our own questions\".\"But it turns out our problems are similar to everyone else's.\"They say the podcast has changed their lives for the better and share what they have changed about their behaviour over the course of more than 30 episodes.Like most of us, the brothers assumed eight hours was the gold standard for sleep and anything less was a failure. Now, they're far less dogmatic.The brothers say a healthy range of sleep can be anywhere between six and 10 hours.\"There's so much anxiety around getting eight hours but some of the most important things in my life, like raising kids, I've done sleep deprived,\" says Chris.Realising that everything from winning wars to completing exams were often done with very little sleep, made them understand that sleep deprivation can sharpen your focus in the short term.Xand says this helped him \"shed all that anxiety\" around optimal sleeping patterns and times.\"It no longer dominates my life and I think about it a lot less.\"He also feels a lot more comfortable taking naps when needed and says he will sometimes \"have a 20 minute sleep if I'm exhausted\".The pair both find saying \"no\" difficult and Xand says it can feel \"almost physically painful.\"They have now learnt the \"power of the pause\". If something does not require an immediate decision, they now ask for more time to think about it so they don't feel pressured into saying yes.Chris says this has helped him have difficult conversations he may otherwise have put off. However, he admits he's still figuring out how to be more forceful.\"I know I should do, but somehow I'm not and I know I need to focus on that.\"The podcast episode on this topic also taught them that they needed to work out what their values are and then weigh up whether requests fitted in with those. For Xand, his priority was spending more time with his wife and two sons.He has since managed to say no to a number of things that he would have otherwise gone along with for an easy life.\"I recently said no to a very big and important work thing even though there was a lot of pressure on me to do it, but it didn't fit with my other commitments and what I wanted to do.\"One of the most practical tips that has stuck with the brothers is how they brush their teeth.The small act has become a mindful task and Xand explains he's totally changed the way he brushes.\"My wife, Dolly, hasn't complained about my bad breath since the episode.\"I use brushes for flossing, hold my toothbrush at a different angle and I don't look at my phone while brushing.\"While Chris is shocked that his brother ever used his phone while brushing his teeth, he agrees with how powerful the changes have been.\"It's about the angle of the brush, being more gentle and having a better picture of what you're trying to achieve - you want to clean every surface of every tooth.\"Many people believe that struggling with diet, exercise or breaking habits is down to personal weakness, and Xand shares those feelings.\"I feel lazy and inadequate most of the time.\"I go to Manchester every week and I usually arrive late after a long train journey and I order a takeaway and do no exercise then I beat myself up about it.\"Their expert guest on this podcast episode, psychologist Kimberley Wilson, helped Xand understand that \"there's no such thing as willpower\".Willpower is not this magic thing inside you, instead your ability to stick to something is \"about the way you've arranged the world around you,\" he says.For example, by planning ahead and thinking about what you'll have for dinner, you can more easily ditch the takeaway and eat something healthy.Since the episode, Xand has managed to increase how much exercise he is doing, but still doesn't enjoy it.\"I just get on the exercise bike and have those negative thoughts while I do my workout,\" he says.Another simple change he's made is taking a bag of apples with him on his regular commute between London and Manchester, rather than buying unhealthy snacks on the train.Chris realised willpower wasn't about increasing your tolerance to distress and suffering, but simply being more organised.\"I've started batch-cooking which now releases time for me to do things like read with my daughter.\"For all the changes they've embraced, the brothers are the first to admit they don't follow every bit of expert advice.Take sunscreen, for example. \"A dermatologist gave us really good advice,\" Dr Chris says, \"but there's something about the sun that feels so powerful. Academically, we know sun exposure is bad and causes cancer but we still find ourselves drawn to it.\"That tension - between what we know and what we do - is at the heart of their podcast.If there's one thing the doctors hope listeners take away from the show, it's that struggling with health isn't a personal failure.\"So much of your health and well-being isn't your fault,\" says Dr Xand.\"There are loads of forces trying to take your money, attention and time away from the things that matter. What we're trying to do is sweep that out of the way, help you identify your values and align your life with them.\"Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq and Iran have destabilised the region through separatist violence. The PKK’s dissolution in May 2025 marks a defining moment, not only ending armed conflict but also opening a transformation with the potential to reshape the region’s future.As unresolved conflicts, rising migration pressures and energy rivalries heighten global uncertainty, Turkiye’s decisive steps offer the prospect of lasting peace, secure energy corridors and sustainable prosperity for Turkiye and the wider region.The human and economic toll of terrorism was staggering. Nearly 50,000 lives were lost, and 1.1 million people were displaced during the decades-long campaign of violence from the early 1980s to the 2020s.Terrorism was not only a security issue but also an economic and social burden for the country. Beyond the human tragedy, the economic cost was equally devastating. Official assessments estimate $1.8 trillion in direct counterterrorism spending and more than $3 trillion when lost growth, investment, tourism and infrastructure damage are taken into account.Peace, on the other hand, promises a reversal. Analyses show that eliminating terrorism-related costs could trigger a substantial rise in per capita income in the southeast over the medium term. In addition, a $14bn programme of 198 projects through 2028 aims to create around 570,000 jobs, focusing on agriculture, tourism and private investment.What sets Turkiye’s conflict settlement apart is its focus on inclusive and participatory citizenship. Rather than relying on external mediation, this is the first peacebuilding effort conducted entirely through a nation’s democratic institutions, with the parliament leading the initiative.Historically, following the emergence of nation-states in the 20th century, many countries confronted secessionist movements that often evolved into terrorism over time. For example, the Good Friday Agreement, which ended “the Troubles,” was achieved through cooperation between the British and Irish governments, with mediation by the United States and Canada, and was finalised within seven years.In Spain’s case, the peace process with ETA was overseen by the International Contact Group and prominent figures such as Kofi Annan, supported by Norway, Switzerland, and France, and concluded within six years. Similarly, Colombia’s peace accord with FARC, reached in four years, was facilitated by Norway and Cuba as guarantor states.In contrast, the period between President Erdogan’s initial call in late 2024 and the PKK’s dissolution announcement in May 2025 – symbolised by the organisation’s burning of weapons to demonstrate its goodwill – spanned less than a year, a pace unmatched in the modern history of peace processes.As Professor Ira William Zartman noted in his “ripeness theory,” peacemaking becomes possible at the “ripe moment”. Turkiye’s rapid progress is remarkable; yet the real test lies in how comprehensively the settlement is implemented.Turkiye’s geographic position at the intersection of Europe, Asia and the Middle East makes its stability crucial for global energy security. Turkiye today stands at the centre of a broader geopolitical arc stretching from the Eastern Mediterranean through the Middle East to the Caucasus and the Black Sea, serving as a unique bridge of connectivity and power. The region surrounding Turkiye contains about 65 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves and 45 percent of its natural gas reserves.Key energy corridors through Turkiye include the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP, delivering 16 billion cubic metres annually to Europe), TurkStream (31.5 billion cubic metres to southeastern Europe), and the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline (carrying 1.2 million barrels per day). This strategic position has also made these corridors prime targets for terrorist attacks.Since the 1980s, the PKK has conducted over 60 major attacks on Turkiye’s critical energy infrastructure, causing multibillion-dollar losses and directly threatening European energy security. The Kirkuk–Ceyhan oil pipeline was sabotaged in 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2015, repeatedly disrupting crude oil flows to Mediterranean markets. In 2008, an attack on the BTC pipeline forced a complete shutdown for weeks, suspending a key Caspian oil corridor to Europe. The Baku–Tbilisi–Erzurum gas pipeline was hit in 2012 and 2015, exposing vulnerabilities in Europe’s natural gas supply. Even NATO’s fuel pipeline network was attacked in 2012 and 2017, demonstrating the strategic scale of the threat. As Europe works to secure energy routes, a terror-free Turkiye has become essential for European energy independence, requiring active cooperation from European and NATO allies.Beyond energy, Turkiye continues to advance major projects that strengthen its position as a transportation corridor. The Development Road project, expected to carry 40 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2050, will link the Gulf to Europe through Turkiye and provide a faster, more cost-effective alternative to the Suez Canal. Moreover, the Middle Corridor already serves as a reliable land bridge, delivering 4.5 million tonnes of cargo in 2024 and projected to exceed 6 million in 2025.Beyond efficiency, stability along these routes enhances investor confidence, strengthens Europe’s diversification strategy, and consolidates Turkiye’s role as a reliable energy and transportation hub uniting East and West. Consequently, a stable and terror-free Turkiye is pivotal not only for the regional economy but also for the global order.The European Union welcomed the PKK’s dissolution as a significant opportunity, expressing its readiness to support the peace process. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, called it “one of the rare pieces of good news from the region,” while the European Parliament’s rapporteur on Turkiye, Nacho Sanchez Amor, described the peace call as a “historic step”.The disbandment of the PKK – recognised as a terrorist organisation by both the EU and the United States – along with its proxies in Syria, namely the YPG and SDF, is expected to strengthen Turkiye’s democracy, help meet EU expectations, and accelerate the country’s accession process. For NATO, of which Turkiye is a longstanding southeastern anchor, acting in the spirit of alliance and upholding the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is essential. The broader international community should support this initiative and refrain from backing proxy structures that undermine it.The foremost challenge is ensuring that all PKK members and affiliated groups fully comply with the dissolution process, especially by adhering to the March 10, 2025 agreement, under which YPG/SDF groups agreed to integrate into the Syrian Armed Forces and operate under Damascus’s authority. It is evident that failure to disarm and integrate would seriously undermine regional security, with direct consequences for Europe’s stability.Another destabilising factor is Israel. Its continued support for the YPG/SDF jeopardises the dissolution process and fuels armed separatism along Turkiye’s borders. Beyond that, the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has shaken regional stability, while Israel has intensified its military actions in Syria and Lebanon, carried out operations in Iran, and launched strikes on targets in Tunisia, Yemen and even Qatar during ceasefire talks. These actions breach international law and threaten the fragile balance that is only now being restored. Israel’s continued aggression thus represents a major threat to the security of both the political and energy order.Decades of chronic fear, pain and division could now give way to solidarity and prosperity. The road ahead will not be free of challenges, yet political unity, social cohesion, and international cooperation can turn this moment into a truly historic opportunity. A terror-free Turkiye safeguards vital energy and trade routes while offering a vision of regional confidence and shared progress.This transformation carries profound implications for the region stretching from Europe to the Caucasus and the Middle East. By removing the threat of terror, disruption, and new waves of migration, Turkiye strengthens the reliability of the critical supply corridors on which Europe depends, attracts greater international investment in energy and logistics projects, and creates the conditions for its neighbours to build on stability rather than conflict. If pursued with determination, this path will pave the way for a future defined by a sustainable security architecture and lasting peace grounded in mutual benefit.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Terror-free Turkiye: A homegrown peace reshaping the region","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/24/terror-free-turkiye-a-homegrown-peace-reshaping-the-region","message":""},{"details":"Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has told the BBC she may run again for the White House.In her first UK interview, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future.Making her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick for the next election.Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a \"tyrant\", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.As the Democratic party searches for answers about Republican Donald Trump's decisive victory one year ago, much of the blame has been directed at former President Joe Biden for not standing down sooner.But there have also been questions raised about whether Harris could have run a better campaign and set out a clearer message on the number one issue, the economy.In the BBC interview Harris entertained the prospect of another run at the White House, saying her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure\", see a female president.Asked if it would be her, she said, \"possibly\", confirming she is considering another run at the top job.Harris said she had not yet made a decision, but underlined that she still sees herself as having a future in politics.\"I am not done,\" the former vice-president said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"Responding to odds that place her as an outsider to win a place on the Democratic ticket - even behind Hollywood actor Dwayne the Rock Johnson - she said she never listened to polls.\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"Harris also said she believed predictions she made about Donald Trump behaving as a fascist and running an authoritarian government had come true.\"He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice - and he has done exactly that.\"She pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.His removal from the airwaves, celebrated by Trump, came after the Trump-appointed regulator threatened Kimmel's broadcasters.\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.\"Harris also slammed business leaders and institutions in America who have, in her view, too easily bowed to the president's demands.\"There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\"The White House was dismissive when asked for a response to Harris's comments about the president.\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.\"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"Harris has just published her account of her rollercoaster campaign, 107 Days, the time that was left to her to run for the presidency after Biden withdrew from the race following months of speculation about his mental acuity.In our full interview with the former vice-president, to be broadcast in the UK on Sunday at 09:00 GMT (05:00 EST), I pressed Harris several times on whether she ought to have urged Biden to make way for her sooner.How much did she really know about his health? And a question that may haunt her - whether she would be president now, not Donald Trump, if Biden had withdrawn earlier?The answer is plainly, unknowable - the great \"if\" that could have changed the fate of America.Among the Democratic soul-searching, Harris's candidacy is often disparaged, her weaknesses as a leader pinpointed as the reasons for her defeat, not just the last-minute nature of Biden's decision.When questioned about what went wrong, rather than plunge into deep analysis, her contention is because she started so late, it was almost impossible to win.But having sat down with the Californian former prosecutor in the gilded surroundings of a luxury London hotel - rather than the increasingly golden surroundings of the Oval Office as Donald Trump glitzes up the decor - the possibility of power is something she is not willing to leave behind.Previous hints of her future presidential ambition seemed coy, non-committal - \"maybe, maybe not\", or \"I'm not focusing on that right now\".Her candour in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.That may be surprising given the thoroughly bruising nature of a defeat she has described as traumatising. She and her team were devastated by the defeat, which came as a surprise to them.\"My god, my god, what will happen to our country?\" Harris says she repeated when the result came through.Her attempt to explain it focuses on how narrow the gap in actual votes was between her and Trump.The popular vote was, indeed, very tight, with less than 2% in it. However, Harris was trounced by Trump in the all-important electoral college, where each state has a certain number of votes that tally up.Harris was willing to drop heavy hints about her own future. But there's less willingness from her, or frankly any other senior Democrats, grappling with their party's long-term dilemmas.How does a centre-left party with mainstream leaders take on a right-wing populist leader? Is the answer to focus on Trump? Or is it to argue more forcefully for Main Street?When I challenged the former vice-president on why her campaign did not better connect with working people, she said she needed more time to do that, and pointed to a longstanding drift away from her party among that group.She regrets she didn't have long enough in 2024 to make her own pitch on bread-and-butter issues like housing, or childcare.But if she had longer next time round, it's far from guaranteed her arguments would be more compelling, or more gladly received.Kamala Harris still travels with the trappings of an entourage.

But will scandals scuttle his goals?By Josefina SalomonShareSaveBuenos Aires, Argentina – A string of high-level scandals, coupled with a stalling economy and eroding approval ratings, are threatening President Javier Milei’s hopes for Argentina's midterm elections.On October 26, Argentina will head to the polls to elect half of its Chamber of Deputies and a third of its upper house, the Senate.Currently, both chambers are controlled by the left-wing and centrist opposition to Milei's far-right party, La Libertad Avanza.But the midterms offer a critical opportunity for Milei's allies to gain ground in Congress.“The government is looking to get a third of Congress to build a ‘legislative shield,'\" said Andres Malamud, a senior research fellow at the University of Lisbon's Institute of Social Sciences.That number of seats, Malamud explained, will prevent the opposition from forming a supermajority to override Milei's vetoes.It would also allow for Milei \"to govern without a majority, for his decrees not to be challenged, and protect him from a potential impeachment in the future\".Experts say the midterms will serve as a de facto referendum on the first half of Milei’s four-year term, which has seen Argentina's sky-high inflation stabilise at the expense of public spending.But success for Milei is far from guaranteed. According to Malamud, voters have yet to see the economic recovery Milei promised in his 2023 bid for the presidency.“So far, he has been able to govern thanks to the public’s support, from people who were struggling but believed he could change things — that the future was going to be better,\" Malamud said.\"But the challenge now is that things are not better, so the question is whether those who supported him before will go and vote for his candidates.”It is not uncommon for a president's party not to have a congressional majority.But Malamud explained that the challenge for Milei is that he has been unable to form strong coalitions.A self-proclaimed anarcho-capitalist and an economist by profession, Milei had campaigned on his status as an outsider, denouncing career politicians as a \"caste\" of thieves.He had only served a single term in the Chamber of Deputies before becoming president.But since winning the presidential run-off in November 2023, Milei has transformed into a rising star on the far right. United States President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk count themselves among his supporters.He has also made good on his pledge to take a \"chainsaw\" to the federal government. As president, he has cut spending on healthcare, education, social services and public infrastructure in order to achieve a fiscal surplus.While his administration has managed to lower inflation, his economic plan saw the Argentinian peso appreciate, which has stalled salary growth.That has led to a sharp fall in the purchasing power of large sectors of the population.Against this backdrop, the race to amass seats in Congress has been challenging for Milei, even when faced with Argentina's fractured left.Malamud believes that, if Milei delivers on his promises of economic recovery, other elements of his platform, including his austerity measures, might seem more palatable.“If Milei manages to keep inflation low — and for that, he needs money — he will have the space to push forward on other aspects of his political agenda,\" Malamud said.\"But if prices and the dollar go up, he will not be able to do this.\"But gaining support has proven difficult, as a series of high-level scandals has taken a toll on the approval ratings for both Milei and his party.On October 6, for instance, a leading Milei-backed candidate, Jose Luis Espert, suspended his campaign after he was charged with money laundering.Prosecutors say Espert accepted at least $200,000 from Federico Andres Machado, an Argentinian businessman who is being extradited to the US on drug trafficking and fraud charges.Until those allegations came to light, Espert had been a leading contender to represent the province of Buenos Aires in the Chamber of Deputies.Milei has denounced the accusations as a \"malicious operation\" to \"smear\" the candidate, and Espert himself has denied any wrongdoing.But Espert is not the only figure in Milei's inner circle to face controversy.A few weeks earlier, leaked audio captured Diego Spagnuolo, the former head of Argentina’s National Disability Agency, accusing the president's sister, Karina Milei, of requesting kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies.Milei, who appointed his sister as secretary-general to the presidency, has likewise rejected those accusations.He called the leaked audio part of an “orchestrated and planned disinformation campaign” aimed at “maliciously influencing the electoral process”.In the wake of the scandal, however, Argentina's Congress delivered high-profile rebukes to Milei's platform.It overrode Milei's veto for the first time in September to defend disability spending. Then, in October, it rejected Milei's veto again to preserve increases to education and healthcare funding.The controversies and legislative hurdles have slowed La Libertad Avanza's momentum going into the midterms, according to Carolina Barry, a political science researcher and co-editor of the Historical Dictionary of Peronism.She sees the road ahead for the party as a rocky one.“The government is facing this race in a state of considerable uncertainty, thanks to the many setbacks it has suffered in Congress and the accusations affecting the party,” Barry said.Just this month, the research firm Nueva Comunicacion found the centre-left political party Fuerza Patria leading Milei's La Libertad Avanza by 15 points ahead of the vote.Experts also point to last month's provincial-level elections in Buenos Aires as a bellwether for the midterms: La Fuerza Patria came out ahead in that race as well.But despite the election-season challenges, Milei has found a powerful ally in President Trump.The US president endorsed Milei on September 23, and a day later, the US Treasury announced it was pursuing a $20bn currency swap with Argentina to stabilise the value of its peso.Those efforts were aimed at giving Milei a boost ahead of the midterm race, a fact Trump himself admitted.But in doing so, Trump warned that the economic lifeline was contingent upon Milei's success at the ballot box.Trump's threat sent the value of the Argentinian peso tumbling, after a brief rally following the news of the currency swap.“Trump is supporting Milei, but then he says something else, and that is generating a lot of questions and uncertainty,” said Barry. \"None of that is helping Milei at home.\"She believes it is likely that La Libertad Avanza will pick up some seats in the midterm election, but not enough to push through Milei's reforms without coalition-building.Mariana Heredia, a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), acknowledged that Trump's support for Milei has generated controversy, with some perceiving it as election interference.But, she said, Trump is unlikely to have the same influence over voters as the biggest factor in the race: the economy.“The government is heading into the election weakened because, unlike last year when it managed to combine stabilisation with a modest economic rebound, this year the effects of the austerity measures are being felt much more strongly across a range of sectors,\" Heredia said.\"The economy is stagnant, and the only sectors showing any momentum or dynamism are mining and oil — which have very little spillover effect on urban populations, who make up the majority of voters.”Malamud likewise expects the success of Milei's party to hinge upon the economy — and market fluctuations could spell disappointment.\"His support base is fragile. It is based on expectations of the future,\" he said.“In the end, everything is about the economy and money.\"Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"High stakes for Javier Milei as midterm elections loom in Argentina","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/24/high-stakes-for-javier-milei-as-midterm-elections-loom-in-argentina","message":""},{"details":"The Crimson Tide and Longhorns both escaped Saturday with narrow victories, when different results would have derailed their seasons.Another weekend of college football is in full swing.

Ukraine has balked at this, and Trump has failed to move either side.Here is what the current front lines look like and how Russia and Ukraine have reacted to this latest proposal:Trump has proposed halting the war where the fighting is now occurring.“They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.“The rest is very tough to negotiate if you’re going to say, ‘You take this. We take that.'”When Trump was asked if he had advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cede the whole of the eastern region of Donbas, which borders Russia and which it has laid claim to, he said no.“Let it be cut the way it is. It’s cut up right now. I think 78 percent of the land is already taken by Russia,” Trump told a reporter from the Reuters news agency.“You leave it the way it is right now. They can … negotiate something later on down the line.”Over the course of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine, Russia has seized territory primarily in four eastern and southern Ukrainian provinces: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. It also controls a small pocket of Kharkiv province.Donetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas, which has seen the most fighting.Russia controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk, including the areas around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.Russia also controls about 75 percent of Kherson and Zaporizhia.Zaporizhia is a significant industrial region known for its steel, aluminium and aircraft manufacturing and is also home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.Ukraine and Europe have backed Trump’s plan to freeze the battle lines.On Tuesday, European leaders and Zelenskyy signed a statement saying they “strongly” support Trump’s proposal.“The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” the statement said.Previously, Ukraine has insisted on reclaiming all of its land. But Trump has flip-flopped over whether Ukraine should or should not be required to cede land to Russia in any peace deal.In August before a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war, Trump stated that both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war.“There’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump told reporters at the time.Then in September, Trump appeared to make a U-turn, saying Ukraine could win the war militarily and recapture the territories occupied by Russia, including the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014, and other areas in eastern Ukraine. “Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!” Trump wrote in a social media post.Russia has rejected the plan.On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to “a long-term, sustainable peace – not an immediate ceasefire that would lead nowhere”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added that “the consistency of Russia’s position doesn’t change,” referring to its hardline demands to end its war, including a complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions that Moscow has laid claim to.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Russia had sent a private communique to the US over the weekend, demanding control of all of the Donbas – not just the parts it has already seized.A planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest, Hungary, in the next two weeks was shelved this week as Trump said he did not want a “wasted meeting” with Putin.“It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get, so I cancelled it. But we’ll do it in the future,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Trump wants to ‘freeze’ Russia-Ukraine war: Who gets what if that happens?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/trump-wants-to-freeze-russia-ukraine-war-who-gets-what-if-that-happens","message":""},{"details":"Lead shouldn’t be in your food, right?Exposure to the substance has been linked to a wide range of health impacts, including developmental problems, nervous system damage and hearing problems in children; and high blood pressure, joint pain and reproductive problems in adults.At the same time, reports continue to document high levels of lead in food products such as applesauce, cinnamon powder, protein powder and chocolate. This year, the US Food and Drug Administration established new guidance on limits of lead content in baby food.It makes sense to ask: Why would there be lead in your diet at all?Lead is a naturally occurring metal found in our planet, and it has been used in products such as gasoline, paint, plumbing, cosmetics, ceramics and batteries, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Science.Lead and cadmium found in muscle-building protein powders, report saysOften, lead in food comes from the soil. “The most common reason is because lead, like other metals and heavy metals, is a naturally occurring part of the earth and the Earth’s crust,” said Dr. Joseph Zagorski, a toxicologist and assistant professor at Michigan State University’s Center for Research on Ingredient Safety.Some plants are more prone to absorbing the lead in the soil and storing them in their own tissue, he added. If crops are grown in areas with higher levels of lead in the environment, they may contain more of the metal.But not all the lead sources in the environment are natural, Zagorski said. Human activities such as smelting frequently lead to lead contamination, and there have been pesticides that contained lead, he added.Use of leaded gasoline can also lead to contamination of plants through the air, said Dr. Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group. Lead has been phased out of gasoline for cars, but is still used in some fuel types.Contamination also can occur through someone adding lead to food, as appeared to be the case in 2023 with some applesauce pouches. But that is not usually the case.Because the heavy metal is found in the environment, people are unlikely to reach a point of zero lead exposure in our food or anywhere. However, lead –– even in small doses –– can have health impacts, Stoiber said.For children, the concern is particularly great because their smaller bodies and metabolisms put them at a greater vulnerability for harms caused by exposure, according to the FDA.The federal agency has been working to reduce dietary exposure to contaminants for children to as close to zero as possible. And no safe level of exposure to lead has been identified, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.However, the FDA does use a benchmark of 2.2 micrograms per day of dietary lead exposure for children and 8.8 micrograms per day for women of childbearing age. Experts use those numbers to evaluate when an exposure is potentially a concern and a product needs to be alerted.The guidelines on dietary lead exposure are hard to translate into practical use at home, and you likely won’t know exactly how much is in the food you are eating, Stoiber said.She recommends looking into brands that regularly test their food products for lead levels. And your best defense against lead –– and any other toxin –– is a diverse, nutritionally dense diet, Zagorski said.Eating a variety of foods can help in two ways. First, it reduces the likelihood that you are eating too much of one food that may be more likely to contain lead.Tea brewing benefits: It may help filter out heavy metals, study findsFor example, earlier this year a report found lead in protein powders. Occasional use of those protein powders isn’t as concerning as a person making protein shakes three times a day.“Protein powder is intended to be a supplement and not a diet,” Zagorski said.Second, a nutrient-dense and varied diet also can help with your body’s natural defenses against unwanted elements, he added. Your body prefers absorbing iron over lead — so if you have enough iron in your diet, your digestive system is more likely to let the lead pass through, he said.“The dose makes the poison,” Zagorski said. “Your body is very good at taking care of itself and getting rid of toxins, so (make) sure that we are giving it the tools it needs and not overconsuming one thing.”Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

The Netherlands has always had a coalition government formed by a minimum of two parties due to its proportional representation electoral system, under which seats in parliament are awarded to parties in proportion to the number of votes they win.The PVV, headed by Geert Wilders, also won the most votes in the last election in November 2023. It then partnered with three other far-right parties – the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), New Social Contract (NSC), and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – to form a coalition government.But in June, PVV made a dramatic exit from the coalition government over a disagreement on immigration policy. PVV had wanted to introduce a stricter asylum policy that included closing borders to new asylum seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes, but the other parties demanded further discussions.In a dramatic move, Wilders took to X to announce that the failure by other parties to agree to PVV’s plans meant it would leave the coalition.Coalition partners slammed this decision and accused Wilders of being driven by self-interest. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said at the time that Wilders “chooses his own ego and his own interests. I am astonished. He throws away the chance for a right-wing policy”.Following the pull-out, Prime Minister Dick Schoof – an independent – announced that he would resign and a snap election would be held this month.Then, in August, the NSC’s Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp also resigned after he failed to secure support for new sanctions against Israel over its war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in Gaza City. In solidarity with Veldkamp, other NSC party members left the coalition, leaving only two parties remaining.Now, with an election imminent, opinion polls suggest the PVV will secure the most seats in the 150-seat parliament. While a winner needs 76 seats to form a government, no single party ever makes it to that figure, which has led to a history of coalitions.According to a poll by the Dutch news outlet, EenVandaag, on October 14, the PVV is projected to secure 31 seats. The centre-left Green-Labour alliance (GroenLinks-PvdA) is polling at 25 seats, and the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) is polling at 23.PVV’s former coalition partner, the centre-right VVD, could take 14 seats and the BBB, four. So far, the NSC is not projected to secure any seats at all.At the end of September, EenVandaag polled 27,191 people and found that the main sticking point between voters – and, hence, between the leaders, PVV and GroenLinks-PvdA – is immigration. Half of all voters said it was the key issue on which they would be voting this year. Housing was the second-most important issue at 46 percent, and “Dutch identity” came third at 37 percent.While the PVV is firmly anti-immigration and wants to impose a much stricter border policy and asylum laws, GroenLinks-PvdA would prefer to allow a net migration figure of 40,000 and 60,000 migrants per year.Tempers are running high over this issue. Last month at The Hague, a right-wing activist known as “Els Rechts” organised an anti-migration protest that attracted 1,500 attendees. According to reports, protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, set a police car alight and smashed windows of the left-wing Democrats 66 (D66) party offices.While left-wingers argue that the immigration issue has been wildly hyped up by the far right, they are losing control of the narrative.Esme Smithson Swain, a member of MiGreat, a Dutch non-governmental campaign group that calls for freedom of movement and equal treatment for migrants in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera that the far right in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, more widely, had “constructed a narrative that there is a migration crisis”.“They’ve managed to construct this idea of a crisis, and that distracts our attention away from populism, away from arms trades, away from social services and the welfare state being sold off.”Whatever its merits, the right-wing message that immigration is at the root of many social ills seems to be taking hold. The far-left, pro-immigration BIJ1 party, which rejects this message, is not projected to win any seats at all in this election.Immigration “is a key term especially for right-wing political parties to win the election”, Noura Oul Fakir, a candidate for the BIJ1 party, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t focus on it because we look at everything that’s been going on from a systemic point of view, that every form of oppression is interlinked … This fight for equality and justice, it’s about more than just immigration, but it’s also interlinked with other issues that we see nowadays.”By January 1, 2024, the Netherlands was hosting 2.9 million migrants (16.2 percent of the population), compared to the average across European Union member states of 9.9 percent (44.7 million people in total).Similarly, Germany hosts 16.9 million migrants (20.2 percent of the population); France, 9.3 million (13.6 percent of the population); Spain, 8.8 million (18.2 percent of the population); and Italy, 6.7 million (11.3 percent of the population), according to figures from the EU.Mark van Ostaijen, an associate professor in public administration and sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, explained that immigration has become a mainstream talking point in “housing, care, educational and cultural policy domains”.For instance, the Netherlands is currently short of 434,000 homes, including for 353,000 asylum seekers and 81,000 Dutch first-time buyers, according to figures commissioned by the Ministry of Housing and Spatial Planning (VRO).Immigration has, therefore, been blamed for what is seen as a housing crisis.According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 316,000 migrants arrived in the country in 2024, 19,000 fewer than in 2023. But CBS also found that population growth is still mainly down to net migration, with the largest number of migrants coming from Ukraine and Syria.“I think this is indeed something that will continue the electoral legitimacy of far-right parties, or right-wing parties, even more, given the fact that the Netherlands was already quite leaning towards the conservative angle,” van Ostaijen told Al Jazeera.“This will be a topic that will haunt our politics and our democratic decision-making and discourse for quite a while,” he said.Anecdotal evidence bears this out. Fakir has noticed a change in the experiences of immigrant residents she and her colleagues have spoken to in the country following the growth of the PVV.“In their personal life [they have seen] a noticeable shift where people feel more free or emboldened to express racist views, both online and in real life. Others are telling them those classic things of ‘go back to your own country, or you’re not Dutch’,” she said.For Nassreddin Taibi, a recent graduate who works as a political analyst and plans to vote for GroenLinks-PvdA, the anti-immigration protests at the Hague “further cemented polarisation among Dutch voters” and have caused centrist parties to fall into line with the right-wing narrative.“These protests have influenced the discourse in the sense that centrist parties now say that cutting immigration is necessary to win back trust of voters in politics,” he said.While the far-right PVV is projected to win the most seats in this election, it will still face an uphill journey to form a government, as other parties such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have ruled out joining a coalition government.Furthermore, the PVV’s leader, Wilders, has not escaped controversy with his Islamophobic comments and anti-migration stance despite the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the country as a whole.Notable incidents over the years include Wilders’ likening of Islam to Nazism in 2007 and his reference to the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as “fascist” in a letter to a Dutch news outlet. His letter and comments led to Wilders being prosecuted for inciting hatred and discrimination, which he denied. In 2011, he was acquitted by a judge who ruled that his comments had fallen within the scope of free speech.More recently, in August this year, Wilders posted an image on X that depicted a smiling, blonde and blue-eyed woman, representing the PVV; and a wrinkled, angry-looking elderly woman wearing a headscarf, representing the PvdA. It was accompanied by the words: “The choice is yours on 29/10.”Aan U de keuze op 29/10 pic.twitter.com/royhcInDlm— Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) August 4, 2025Fake news and misinformation have also driven the rise in far-right narratives, analysts say.The Facebook page ‘Wij doen GEEN aangifte tegen Geert Wilders’ (We are NOT filing charges against Geert Wilders), which claims to be a PVV supporters’ page boasting 129,000 followers, said it does not intend to be “discriminatory, hateful, or incite violence”, but has nevertheless posted AI-generated images of this nature.In one such image, which received 1,700 likes, a white family is seemingly being harassed by men of colour.In another, a white woman is seen in a supermarket paying for groceries while surrounded by Muslim women wearing hijabs and niqabs, with the caption: “No mass immigration, no Islamisation, no backwardness of the Dutch.” The post received 885 likes.While the outgoing home affairs minister, Judith Uitermark, has said the government is examining new ways to combat fake news, she added that the Netherlands is somewhat protected from the rise of extremism by its proportional representation system, under which no one party ever wins a majority.Still, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has warned voters not to use AI chatbots to help them decide who to vote for.And a large number are still deciding. EenVandaag found that some 48 percent of voters are still undecided about which candidate they will choose. If the GroenLinks-PvdA can disengage from right-wing talking points and, instead, focus on its own policies more, it may perform better than expected, analysts say.This will be no easy task, however.“We find ourselves doing this also as a civil society organisation, as campaigners, trying to fight off the narrative and fight off the kind of populist ideals of the far right faster than we can push for our own agenda as well. And I think a lot of the time that leaves left-wing parties in the Netherlands seeming a bit hollow,” Swain said.Still, she says that she is holding out hope for this election, despite what feels like a “vast and growing far-right bulk of the population”.“I think it’s very easy to kind of feel that division between ‘us and them’. Us campaigning on the left and this growing mass of the far right,” Swain said.“We need to tackle fighting the influence of lobbying and of fake news in our political structures. And I think that becoming more united as a population would naturally fall from that.”Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Dutch voters hit polls as immigration fears propel far right towards power","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/dutch-voters-hit-polls-as-immigration-fears-propel-far-right-towards-power","message":""},{"details":"The Crimson Tide and Longhorns both escaped Saturday with narrow victories, when different results would have derailed their seasons.Another weekend of college football is in full swing.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 1,722 healthcare workers have been killed in Israeli strikes in the past two years.According to HWW, most healthcare workers were abducted by the Israeli military from their hospitals or ambulances while they were on duty. Testimonies collected by HWW and other organisations catalogue the torture and abuse that Palestinians endure in Israeli detention.Dr Rebecca Inglis, of HWW, says: “Israel’s continued detention of nearly one hundred healthcare workers is in clear contravention of International Humanitarian Law. We are gravely concerned for their welfare given the extensive evidence that Palestinian detainees are being tortured while in Israeli detention.”Abu Safia, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza, was arrested by Israeli forces on December 27, 2024, after troops raided the hospital, which at the time was one of the last functioning medical facilities in the region.Amnesty International says that the hospital director has been held without charge or trial under an Israeli security law.Despite relentless bombardment and the tragic death of his own son in an Israeli air strike, Abu Safia remained on duty, caring for patients and leading his team through unimaginable conditions.Since his detention, credible reports have emerged of torture, physical abuse and degrading treatment, including suffering significant weight loss and the denial of adequate medical care, hygiene and timely access to legal counsel – in clear violation of international law.At least 94 percent of hospitals in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, with many no longer operational. In addition to this, skilled doctors and healthcare workers have been killed, and paired with the detention of healthcare workers – most of whom were detained while working within hospitals and healthcare facilities – it has added to the immense pressure on Gaza’s vulnerable health system.Between October 7, 2023, to October 20, 2025, HWW documented a total of 431 cases of detained Palestinian healthcare workers.As of October 20, 2025:HWW has said it has not yet received an update from the families of 22 detained healthcare workers, who are not included in the “confirmed detained” or “confirmed released” figures.The healthcare professionals still detained by Israel have spent an average of 511 days in detention, with some held captive since the early weeks of the war.Of the 95 being held, 80 are from Gaza, while the remaining 15 are from the occupied West Bank.From Gaza alone, 31 nurses have been detained, followed by 17 physicians, 15 hospital support and management staff, 14 paramedics, two pharmacists and one medical technician. Twenty-five held senior positions, 50 occupied mid-level positions, while five were junior healthcare workers. All except one are male.Most of the healthcare workers lived in North Gaza, with 36 of the prisoners from there, followed by 24 from Khan Younis, 18 from Gaza City and 3 from Rafah.The table below lists more information about the 95 healthcare workers still held captive by Israel.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Who are the 95 Palestinian medics held captive by Israel?","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/who-are-the-95-palestinian-healthcare-workers-held-captive-by-israel","message":""},{"details":"Al Jazeera visits some of New York City's diverse working-class Muslim communities to learn how voters are viewing November's mayoral race.By Joseph StepanskyShareSaveNew York City - In the Bronx's Morrisania neighbourhood, you often hear a familiar refrain: “Mamdani, Mamdani, Mamdani”.Home to a fast-growing West African community - including many new-immigrant Muslims - Morrisania is among many areas where identity issues of race converge with the needs of the working class ahead of New York’s November 4 mayoral election.Many in this community are counting on 34-year-old candidate Zohran Mamdani to win.After all, a victory for Mamdani over former Governor Andrew Cuomo would mark a series of historic firsts for New York City - its first Muslim mayor, the first born in Africa, and the first person of South Asian descent to lead the largest city in the United States.It is a fact that has sparked hope - and grim reminders of entrenched Islamophobia and xenophobia - across the diverse Muslim communities interwoven into the fabric of the city.But for Aicha Donza, a shop owner in Morrisania, the Bronx, where annual incomes are half the city's average, it is the avowed Democratic Socialist's message of affordability - ambitious pledges for free buses, rent freezes on certain buildings, and universal childcare, paid for, in part, by increasing taxes on the wealthy - that has won her support.“He says he’s going to make things easier,” Donza told Al Jazeera, showing off the wares in her store: plantain powder from Ghana; Liberian palm oil imported from the country where she was born; traditional Islamic garb imported from Turkiye, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.“The rent is so high, every day people come into the store, they say the prices are too high,” she said. “And free buses, if he can manage that, that would make a huge difference”.Outside of the nearby Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx, following afternoon prayers, Essa Tunkala, 60, ruminated over what the election could mean for the neighbourhood, a melting pot of both working-class trades - parking attendants, cab drivers, and store workers - and West African diaspora.“It’s almost like you’re in West Africa,” Tunkala grinned, listing residents from Senegal, Liberia, Ghana, Togo, and Mali, to name a few.He pointed to several serious questions that continue to hang over Mamdani’s run: How will he actualise his vision? Will he be able to rise above the relatively limited ability of the mayoral position to build the kind of coalition with state officials and lawmakers needed to realise his marquee pledges?“But we need fresh ideas to create opportunities,” said Tunkala, who is originally from the Gambia and sells sporting goods from a table on the street. “This is a new generation with new ideas for development, that’s why I support him.”Ahmed Jejote, a 55-year-old cab driver from Sierra Leone, echoed the sentiment.“We’ve experienced Eric Adams,” he said, referring to the corruption-plagued current city mayor, who dropped out of the race in September. “We’ve seen Cuomo.”“Mamdani is just starting out, and he wants to go forward,” he said. “So it’s not really about religion for me”.Blocks away, 46-year-old Mariam Saleh stood over steaming trays of food at Kumasi Restaurant: banku, a fermented mixture of maize and cassava; suya, a spiced meat skewer; kwenkwen, a type of jollof rice.She was less circumspect about the historic nature of Mamdani’s run.“That he is Muslim, for us, is huge progress,” the 46-year-old, who is originally from Ghana, told Al Jazeera.“It’s huge progress for the Muslim community in America, not just in New York.”Surging to a surprise victory in the June primary, Mamdani represents a kaleidoscope of the diversity that defines the city of more than 8.4 million, where an estimated 800 languages are spoken. Up to one million Muslims live in New York City, estimated to be a quarter of all Muslims in the US.Mamdani is socially progressive, with a history of grassroots activism and staunchly pro-Palestine views. While they do not define his campaign, he has embraced his ties to his birthplace, Uganda, and his identity as a Muslim son of parents of Indian Gujarati and Punjabi descent.For Asad Dandia, an urban historian, Mamdani’s success to date is a culmination of 400 years of Muslim history in the city, stretching back to the enslaved Africans brought to New York, about 30 percent of whom were Muslim.Muslim political power has been both inhibited and energised by waves of discrimination, including in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks and more recently, the genocide in Gaza.Dandia was among the New Yorkers surveilled in the wake of September 11, when the New York Police Department (NYPD) and federal government reportedly spied on at least 250 mosques within a 160km (100-mile) radius of the city, as well as an unknown number of individuals. He launched a successful lawsuit in 2013 after he was targeted by a confidential informant.Mamdani, who Dandia befriended last year, has also spoken about a classmate at his Bronx high school who was “pressured to become an informant”.“I honestly think some of us have forgotten how truly bad it was,” Dandia reflected, adding that US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory further charged political action.“So the last 25 years, since 9/11, have really moulded the community into becoming this formidable force. And I think nothing demonstrates that better than this mayoral election cycle,” the 32-year-old added.“It's crazy that the same police department that surveilled me and [Mamdani’s community] and the rest of the Muslim community is now going to be under his command.”Dandia’s home neighbourhood in Brighton Beach, where the outer edge of Brooklyn meets the Atlantic Ocean, is a study in the fickle nature of politics for communities that feel left behind.The area hosts a Pakistani enclave served by four mosques, as well as a quickly growing Uzbek Muslim population. On Fridays, the city sometimes closes a portion of one of the main streets to accommodate the overflow from prayer.Voters here swung towards Trump in the 2020 presidential election, but went for the Democratic Socialist Mamdani over his opponents in June’s Democratic primary.Erum Hanif, who heads a community centre launched after the neighbourhood was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, said the idiosyncratic shift indicates, in part, “that the current system is not working out”.“Many working-class New Yorkers are earning on a day-to-day basis - Uber drivers, grocery store workers, healthcare workers and the working professional, and they are struggling to afford to live. That made them shift towards Mamdani,” the 42-year-old said.At a daycare for the elderly run by Hanif’s group - APNA Brooklyn Community Center, which as an organisation does not endorse any candidate - the aunties said they were all in for Mamdani.Amina Malik, from Lahore, Pakistan, said a top concern is the high price of rent and childcare, both issues that impact elderly residents in an outsized way.“A lot of seniors like me are struggling to get into rent-stabilised buildings and apartments,” she said in Urdu. “Families cannot afford childcare - Mamdani is going to work on that.”Perveen Zia, 66, who is also from Lahore, saw in Mamdani the type of representation she had not witnessed before in City Hall - someone who “understands our language and culture” and will ensure services are administered “equitably”.“Zohran is like my son,” she said.About 18km (12 miles) away, in the Queens neighbourhood of South Richmond Hill, the minarets of Masjid Al Abidin rise above the roti shops and garland-laden bridal stores selling saris and shalwar kameez in “Little Guyana”.The area is a microcosm of the overlapping identities of the city’s vast patchwork of neighbourhoods, displaying Guyana’s mix of Indo-Caribbean and South Asian culture: a South American society where Christianity, Islam and Hinduism plait.“In this neighbourhood, everyone lives like they’re cousins,” said Annie Nazir, 46, who works in childcare and moved to the US from Georgetown, Guyana five years ago.But the masjid or mosque also underscores the challenges facing the local population. Construction on the towering structure began in 2012, but has sputtered amid various stresses, including the economic toll of the COVID pandemic. The project relies almost solely on community donations, those familiar said.Because of that, congregants currently pray in a nearby two-storey townhouse, with the women’s section located in a similar building across the street.“As working-class people, a lot of people think it’s time for a change,” Nazir, who attends the mosque, told Al Jazeera. She is a volunteer chapter leader for DRUM Beats, a political committee representing South Asian and Indo-Caribbean workers that is hoping to turn out the vote for Mamdani.The upstart politician has maintained a commanding lead in the polls since the primary, but that has narrowed since current Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race in September.Cuomo, meanwhile, has sought to make inroads in some of the communities that buoyed Mamdani.During a primary debate in June, the former governor struggled to name a single mosque he had visited during his 10 years in office. After losing the primary, Cuomo made his first visit of the campaign to a mosque in September, since visiting at least four in the Bronx and Queens.At least one Muslim religious leader, Imam Qazi Qayyoom based in Jackson Heights, Queens, has endorsed Cuomo.Mamdani jabbed Cuomo’s newfound approach during a debate on October 16.“It took me,” he said, “to get you to even see those parts of the city.”The line of attack has resonated with some in the Guyanese community, who noted Mamdani visited Masjid Al Abidin back in May ahead of the primary. Other ties to the community predate the election.As an assemblyman, Mamdani advocated for Prakash Churaman, a Guyanese immigrant who has maintained he was coerced into giving a false murder confession. He joined taxi workers in a 15-day hunger strike in 2021.Clint Ally, who spoke to Al Jazeera following evening prayers at the masjid, said he hopes Mamdani’s community-oriented style - which has included eschewing corporate donations for small donors - resonates.“He could go down in history as the first Muslim mayor, but this is a very diverse city,” the 49-year-old said.“We need someone who understands everybody.”Sitting in his office on 5th Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 71-year-old Zein Rimawi's eyes tear up as he watches a video of Palestinian prisoners being released as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.Mamdani’s outspoken support for Palestinian rights and condemnation of the genocide in Gaza has been particularly resonant in the local community, dubbed “Little Palestine”, where cafes bear names like “Al Aqsa Bakery” and “Nablus Sweets”.Rimawi said he has known Mamdani for about eight years, stretching back to when the then-20-something worked on a campaign in support of Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian-American Lutheran pastor who launched an unsuccessful bid for New York City Council in 2017.“I always say to young people: run for any seat. If you win, we win,” he said. “If you lose, we win.”“Because for a Muslim to run for a seat by itself, it's not easy, but it matters,” he said. “So it’s a win-win situation.”But Rimawi also saw Mamdani’s success - at least so far -  as the product of a widening wealth gap in the city, an issue particularly relevant in a neighbourhood like Bay Ridge, once a working-class stronghold where housing prices have skyrocketed in recent years.“When I got married in 1988, one week’s salary would cover the average rent. Now it costs most of your salary for a month,” said Rimawi, who is originally from the occupied West Bank. “The middle class here in New York is disappearing. If it keeps going like this, soon we’ll only have two classes: The rich and the poor.”Next door, Essa Masoud, 46, runs the Balady Market, selling products from across the Levant.The Palestinian American, who was born and raised in Bay Ridge, was not surprised to see the Islamophobic tropes pushed by the far right in the wake of Mamdani’s June victory.Trump has threatened to revoke Mamdani’s citizenship. Cuomo has called him a “terrorist sympathiser\".Masoud saw those attacks as a carefully calibrated “political tool”.“It’s an effort to change the understanding of the general public, to make people fear that is not the person they should vote for,” he said.Masoud added that as a business owner and landlord, he does carry reservations about Mamdani’s policies, including his support for rent freezes and for a $30 hourly minimum wage in the city.He’s not opposed to Mamdani’s vision, but hopes there “will be balance” if he is elected.Down the block, Marwa Janini, 34, heads the Arab American Association of New York, which does not endorse any candidate.For her, the last two years have been defined by two words: pain and pride.Pain over the atrocities in Gaza and an Islamophobic backlash fuelled in part by the Trump administration. Pride over the success of Mamdani and the message he carries.“As Muslim New Yorkers, our identities are not fixed; they’re fluid,” she said. “But for someone who grew up in post September 11 New York, with all the fear that created, this is huge.”“It is a big win for a visibly Muslim woman like myself,” she said, adding that her organisation had been targeted with hate messaging over the last two years, including a death threat pushed under the door.She hoped Mamdani’s victory could help to dispel some of those prejudices, especially if he shows he will be “mayor for all New Yorkers”.“To be in a city where we are possibly - inshallah - going to have a Muslim mayor,” she said, “it is a big deal.”Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"NYC working-class Muslims see progress in Mamdani, but policies win votes","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/10/22/nyc-working-class-muslims-see-progress-in-mamdani-but-policies-win-votes","message":""},{"details":"He is a baby-faced tycoon who rose to the highest echelons of power in his adopted home of Cambodia, where he bestows scholarships and runs philanthropy programs while overseeing one of the country’s largest and best-connected conglomerates.But behind this façade, Chen Zhi, 37, runs one of the largest transnational criminal organizations in Asia, US authorities say, an empire fueled by forced labor and cryptocurrency scams that at one point were allegedly earning Chen and his associates $30 million every day.The money went on buying Picasso artwork, private jets and properties in upscale neighborhoods of London, ﻿as well as supplying bribes to public officials, according to prosecutors in New York, who last week ﻿announced they had seized $15 billion in cryptocurrency from Chen following a years-long investigation.That action has thrown a rare light on an alleged kingpin of Southeast Asia’s murky and criminal world of online scams, which US authorities say operate under the protection of powerful politicians, and conned victims in the US alone out of at least $10 billion dollars last year.Chen’s Prince Group employs thousands of people and bills itself as one of the biggest conglomerates in Cambodia, with investments in luxury real estate, banking services, hotels, major construction developments, grocery stores and even luxury watches.But last week, the company was declared a transnational criminal organization by United States authorities, and Chen was charged in absentia in New York with money laundering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, along with several associates.He is still at large, and currently faces no legal threat in Cambodia, which has no extradition treaty with the US.Prince Group, American and British authorities allege, was the umbrella for more than 100 shell companies and entities allegedly used to funnel laundered cash across 12 countries and territories from Singapore to St Kitts and Nevis.“Chen Zhi isn’t a mob boss as we traditionally conceive of them – he is (or rather was) the polished face of a state-protected criminal economy,” said Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Center and a transnational crime expert.Feds seize $15 billion in crypto from ‘pig butchering’ scheme involving forced labor campsCNN has reached out to Prince Group for comment. CNN has also reached out to the Cambodian government and interior ministry for comment.Prince Group has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing as “false and defamatory” in statements published on its website. Those statements have since been taken down.Little was known about Chen, also known as Vincent, until he arrived in Cambodia and began splashing enormous amounts of cash.He was born in China’s southeastern province of Fujian on December 16, 1987, according to the US Treasury Department.His first business ventures were reportedly an internet café and gaming centers in the provincial capital Fuzhou. In 2011, he plunged into the “uncharted waters of real estate investment in Cambodia,” according to a profile on the website of DW Capital Holdings, a Singapore-based fund manager that lists Chen as its founder and chairman, and which is among the companies sanctioned by the US.Billion-dollar scamIn those “uncharted waters,” a rush of mainly Chinese developers started building casinos in the western Cambodian city of Sihanoukville in the 2010s, turning the quiet seaside town and backpacker haven into a roaring gambling mecca, encouraged by lax regulation and the easy availability of casino licenses.With the casinos and online gambling came organized crime, money laundering, prostitution, drug trafficking and online scamming. The town was described as a “wild west” where a prolific business-crime nexus emerged.Shortly after his arrival in Cambodia, Chen became a naturalized Cambodian citizen – an option available to applicants who donate $250,000 to the state. Analysts say he acquired venerable titles and rapidly gained influence with the Cambodian elite.He was elevated to be a senior adviser to the government at the rank of minister, was personal adviser to former Prime Minister Hun Sen, and then his son and successor Hun Manet, and bestowed with the honorific “neak oknha,” a title awarded to prominent businesspeople.Video posted by the former Cambodian leader shows Chen standing alongside Hun Sen in 2022 during a meeting of investors. Chen was also part of a delegation that traveled with Hun Sen to Cuba in 2022, during which he met Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and was listed as an “adviser” to Hun Sen.According to the US indictment, Chen also traveled to the US in April 2023 using a diplomatic passport – a document it alleges Chen obtained after purchasing luxury watches for a senior foreign government official.Browse the website of Chen’s Prince Group, and the company’s public image is one of charitable endeavors, business accolades and awards for corporate social responsibility initiatives, large donations to anti-Covid efforts, and education programs.The group’s charitable trust claims to have donated funds worth $14 million to help Cambodians in a range of initiatives. The company even opened a Prince Horology Vocational Training Center, billed as the country’s first independent watch school.And it commands a visible presence in the country, with skyscrapers dotting the skylines of Cambodia’s cities. Through its subsidiary Canopy Sands Development, Prince Group has embarked on a $16 billion project near Sihanoukville to develop a 934-hectare “eco city” called the Bay of Lights.‘Don’t try to escape’ — Inside the shadowy world of crypto ATM scamsBut federal prosectors allege that empire extended to at least 10 forced labor camps in Cambodia, where workers were coerced into carrying out scams “at high volumes” under the threat of violence. The indictment described vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire where incidences of violence and coercion were “frequent.”From alleged organized crime investments in Palau to shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong and Singapore, investigators implicated 146 entities and individuals linked to Chen, his Prince Group and associates.“It’s really remarkable in terms of both the state, the scale and size of what they’ve seized, but also the extent to which they’ve been able to identify and target so many of the different nodes of this particular criminal network,” said Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC).As well as Cambodian citizenship, Chen is listed by the US Treasury Department as having passports from Cyprus and the small Pacific island of Vanuatu.Several of the addresses listed to Chen are in Hong Kong. Construction and engineering services firm Geotech Holdings – which has seven subsidiaries, each sanctioned by the US government – has headquarters in Kwai Chung, home to the city’s container port. The company did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.Authorities also allege Chen and his co-conspirators bribed public officials in China and elsewhere to stay ahead of investigations and raids on the forced labor compound. Chen kept ledgers of bribes, according to the indictment, and in 2019 a $3 million yacht was bought for a senior official in an unnamed foreign government.Crypto crime scene: How the companies behind crypto ATMs profit as Americans lose millions to scamsBy approximately 2020, Chen had allegedly amassed a staggering sum of laundered proceeds that included approximately 127,271 bitcoin worth $15 billion across unhosted cryptocurrency wallets whose private keys he personally held.Chen mastered a combination of elite access, patronage and philanthropy “that opened doors across real estate, finance, and politics, ultimately providing him the resources and protection needed to grow his scam empire,” said Sims.Cambodia has been described by analysts as a de facto scam state that risks becoming a global pariah if it fails to act against the criminal networks within its borders.The global scam industry, estimated to be worth between $50 billion and $70 billion, is evolving at an unprecedented scale, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime said earlier this year, despite widely publicized crackdowns on scam compounds in Myanmar.Cambodia, which has emerged as an epicenter of this scam economy, is estimated to make $12.5 billion to $19 billion a year from cybercrime – equivalent to about 60% of the country’s GDP, according to a report published by the Humanity Research Consultancy in May.Global scam industry evolving at ‘unprecedented scale’ despite recent crackdownIn June, an Amnesty International report accused the Cambodian government of “deliberately ignoring a litany of human rights abuses including slavery, human trafficking, child labour and torture” carried out by criminal gangs in scamming compounds across the country.And the US State Department named Cambodia a state sponsor of human trafficking in its 2025 Trafficking in Persons report, which noted that senior Cambodian officials owned properties used by online scam operators to exploit victims.Analysts estimate there are about 300 scamming compounds in the country with a workforce of up to 200,000 people. Cambodia’s garment and textile industry, long a mainstay of its economy, employs about 1 million people, according to the UN.The Humanity Research Consultancy report, authored by Sims, goes further, detailing how the Cambodian leadership and Cambodian state institutions are “deeply and directly implicated in the growth, durability, and flourishing” of the country’s scam industry.“The charges focus on Chen and Prince, not the state per se, but the pattern is unmistakable: you don’t build ten forced-labor scam compounds, move billions, and buy impunity without political protection,” Sims said. “It is impossible to imagine that such vast wealth would be moving through the system without the explicit knowledge and participation of its strongman and his immediate circle.”The criminal operations have gone largely unchallenged in Cambodia due to the complete dismantling in recent years of the country’s civil society and independent media.In October 2024, the arrest of prominent Cambodian journalist Mech Dara, who helped expose the human trafficking fueling online scam centers, prompted widespread international concern.“Civil society in Cambodia has been decimated,” said GI-TOC’s Tower. “And anyone who goes and reports on this issue now they’re silenced. So there’s no space to report on the scam economy, or to raise these issues in the media, civil society can’t touch it.”Concern grows for detained journalist awarded by US for exposing online scam centersThe Cambodian government has repeatedly denied any link to the cybercrime industry, and said this month that it is “committed to preventing and suppressing all forms of cross-border crimes, particularly online scams.”Earlier this year, Prime Minister Hun Manet established a commission to target the scammers. The government says it has led to the arrest of 3,455 suspects, of 20 nationalities, accused of cybercrime. Authorities also say they have broken up several organized crime and trafficking networks, rescuing human trafficking victims in the process.“We do not protect individuals who violate the law,” Cambodia’s Interior Ministry spokesman Touch Sokhak told the Associated Press news agency regarding Chen. He stressed that Cambodia’s government itself does not accuse Prince Group﻿ or Chen of wrongdoing.The ministry has also rejected reports that Interior Minister Sar Sokha is a co-investor in the Jin Bei Casino Company – which the US Treasury said runs “among the most notorious” of Prince Group’s scam compounds. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Cambodia said it was “taking careful monitoring and investigation measures” to ensure Prince Group’s financial services arm Prince Bank “complies with Cambodian laws.”Cambodia is “at a crossroads,” said Tower.The UK-US action “sends a very strong signal to both the criminal networks, as well as to those elites in Cambodia that are protecting them, and sponsoring them… that this type of impunity is not going to continue, that your assets are no longer safe. And so, I think it is potentially a game changer,” Tower said.Regional countries have begun to act against the crime flourishing inside Cambodia’s borders that has ensnared their citizens.South Korea last week issued a travel ban for parts of Cambodia after the death of a South Korean student lured to work in the scam compounds, according to police. More than 60 South Korean nationals were deported from Cambodia and police are seeking to detain most of them over allegations they were involved in online scams.Chen is at large, with a net worth somewhere in the tens of billions, analysts believe. And the scam compounds in Cambodia continue to operate, stealing money from victims including US citizens.“It’s not like there’s an off button that you can push to stop all of these scam centers,” said Tower.The question now turns to whether the US, UK and their allies can use the leverage from their joint operation effectively to dismantle the highly lucrative industry.“This is the first time Washington and London have hit the architecture – the elite ownership, the laundering conduits, and the money itself – at the very top,” Sims said.“Blunting (Cambodia’s) ability to operate as a de facto scam state will not only materially disrupt the crime today, it will also serve as an effective deterrent model as this crime continues to spread globally,” he added.“Now is the time to keep the pedal down.”CNN’s Kara Scannell, Yong Xiong and Gawon Bae contributed reporting.© 2025 Cable News Network.

It considers grey list countries to be those with “strategic deficiencies” in their anti-money laundering regimes, but which are nonetheless working with the organisation to address them.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo called the removal of the four “a positive story for the continent of Africa”.South Africa revamped its tools to detect money laundering and terrorist financing, she said, while Nigeria created better coordination between agencies, Mozambique increased its financial intelligence sharing, and Burkina Faso improved its oversight of financial institutions.Nigeria and South Africa were added to the list in 2023, preceded by Mozambique in 2022 and Burkina Faso in 2021.Officials from the four countries – which will no longer be subject to increased monitoring by the organisation – welcomed the decision.Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said the delisting marked a “major milestone in Nigeria’s journey towards economic reform, institutional integrity and global credibility”, while the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit separately said it had “worked resolutely through a 19-point action plan” to demonstrate its commitment to improvements.Edward Kieswetter, commissioner of the South African Revenue Service, also cheered the update but said, “Removing the designation of grey listing is not a finish line but a milestone on a long-term journey toward building a robust and resilient financial ecosystem.”Leaders in Mozambique and Burkina Faso did not immediately comment, though Mozambican officials had signalled for several months that they were optimistic about being removed.In July, Finance Minister Carla Louveira said Mozambique was “not simply working to get off the grey list, but working so that in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, when the FATF makes its assessment in 2030, it will find a completely different situation from the one detected in 2021,” MZ News reported at the time.More than 200 countries around the world have pledged to follow the standards of the FATF, which reviews their efforts to combat money laundering, as well as terrorist and weapons financing.The FATF’s black or “high-risk” list consists of Iran, Myanmar and North Korea.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Four African countries taken off global money-laundering ‘grey list’","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/24/four-african-countries-taken-off-global-money-laundering-grey-list","message":""},{"details":"Catherine Connolly, a pro-Palestine, left-wing candidate, secures 63 percent of the vote to defeat centre-right rival.By Al Jazeera Staff and News AgenciesShareSaveLeft-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly has won Ireland’s presidential election, securing 63 percent of the vote to defeat her centre-right rival.Connolly, 68, was officially declared the winner of Friday’s vote after all 43 constituencies finished counting ballots on Saturday evening.“I will be a president who listens, who reflects and who speaks when it’s necessary,” Connelly said in a speech at Dublin Castle.“Together we can shape a new republic that values everybody,” she added.Her competitor, Heather Humphreys, 64, of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat hours before the official result.“Catherine will be a president for all of us, and she will be my president, and I really would like to wish her all the very, very best,” Humphreys, who won 29.5 percent of the vote, had said earlier in the day.Polls had suggested consistent and strong voter support for Connolly, a former barrister and independent lawmaker since 2016.Connolly has been outspoken in criticising Israel over its war in Gaza and had garnered the backing of a range of left-leaning parties, including Sinn Fein, the Labour Party and the Social Democrats.Her campaign was especially popular among young people, who approved of her strong pro-Palestine stance and her commitment to social justice, among other issues.Deputy Prime Minister and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris also wished Connolly “every success”, adding, “She will be President for all this country.”“Her success will be Ireland’s success,” he posted on X before the official results were announced.Connolly and Humphreys were the only contenders after Jim Gavin, the candidate for Prime Minister Micheal Martin’s Fianna Fail party, quit the race three weeks before the election over a long-ago financial dispute. Martin had backed Gavin in the race.While Irish presidents represent the country on the world stage, host visiting heads of state and play an important constitutional role, they do not have the power to shape laws or policies.Connolly will succeed Michael D Higgins, who has been president since 2011, having served the maximum two seven-year terms.She will be Ireland’s 10th president and the third woman to hold the post.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"Connolly wins Ireland’s presidential election in landslide","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/25/connolly-set-to-be-irelands-next-president-after-rival-concedes-defeat","message":""},{"details":"The US says it is fighting drugs, but its warships off Venezuela tell another story about power, control and regime change.By Guillaume LongGuillaume Long is a senior policy analyst at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.ShareSaveTen thousand soldiers on board 10 US warships, including a nuclear submarine, several destroyers and a missile cruiser, patrol the southern Caribbean in what is the largest US military build-up in the region in decades. At least seven boats allegedly transporting drugs have been bombed, resulting in the extrajudicial killing of more than 32 people. And now the US administration is threatening Venezuela with direct military action. The Pentagon has reportedly drawn up plans for military strikes inside Venezuela, and President Trump has authorised the CIA to conduct lethal covert operations there.All of this is ostensibly aimed at getting rid of Maduro, who Trump claims is leading a vast criminal organisation. “Maduro is the leader of the designated narco-terrorist organisation Cartel de los Soles, and he is responsible for trafficking drugs into the United States,” Secretary of State — and longtime Venezuela hawk — Marco Rubio has said to justify the US military posture in the region. The United States has also placed a $50m bounty on the Venezuelan president’s head.The official narrative is a fabrication. The existence of a Venezuelan government-run “Cartel de los Soles”, let alone its control of the transnational cocaine trade from Venezuela, has been largely debunked. And while “Tren de Aragua” is a real criminal organisation with a transnational presence, it lacks the capacity to operate in the ways suggested by the United States; it certainly pales in comparison to the power of cartels in Colombia, Mexico, or Ecuador.Tellingly, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2024 does not even mention Venezuela. And a classified National Intelligence Council report established that Maduro did not control any drug trafficking organisation. There is no denying that there is some transiting of drugs through Venezuela, but the volume is marginal compared with the cocaine currently passing through South America’s Pacific Coast routes. And Venezuela plays no role in the production and export of synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, or with the US’s broader opioid crisis. Put simply, if the Trump administration was actually intent on combating drug trafficking, Venezuela makes little sense as a target.So what is US policy really about? And where might this dramatic escalation lead?At first, the US display of force off the coast of Venezuela appeared to be an exercise in political theatre: an attempt by President Trump to project his “tough on crime” approach to domestic — including eager MAGA — audiences. “If you traffic in drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold,” US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last week. Recent polls show that crime remains one of Americans’ primary concerns.Another reading was that Trump’s build-up was a political stunt designed to appease the neo-cons in his administration, sectors of Washington’s foreign policy establishment, and radical elements of the Venezuelan opposition, including Maria Corina Machado, the new Nobel Laureate and hardline opposition leader who has called for foreign intervention in her own country. Unlike more moderate Venezuelan opposition leaders, these actors are all hostile to any perceived normalisation with Venezuela and oppose Trump’s recent granting of an operating licence to Chevron. The build-up appeared, in this light, as a typical Trumpian bluff: projecting toughness towards Maduro while simultaneously securing Venezuela’s oil.One potential scenario is that the rhetorical escalation of the last few weeks will not be matched by direct attacks on Venezuela, and that the United States’s extrajudicial killings in the Caribbean will simply continue as they have over the last month and a half. In the absence of any serious US drug policy — especially on the vital issues of consumption or money laundering — the satellite imagery of small boats being blown up in the Caribbean serves Trump’s agenda well, albeit with tragic consequences for the boats’ unidentified occupants and their families.But today, the sheer scale of the US military build-up does not align with the idea of a cynical political stunt, nor does Trump’s decision to cut off all diplomatic backchannels with the Venezuelan government and deauthorise special envoy Rick Grenell’s outreach to Maduro. The more we look at the military deployment and the increasingly belligerent rhetoric from Trump officials, the more the pursuit of regime change through military means appears to be the most plausible explanation.Rubio and his fellow Florida Republicans have, of course, been ardently advocating for a more aggressive approach towards Venezuela for years. For Rubio, toppling the Venezuelan president — and perhaps, if he can ride the momentum, even overthrowing the Communist Party in Cuba — is a generational objective, more symbolic than strategic, and rooted in political passions and fantasies of return and revenge.Given that US sanctions, coup attempts and the support of a parallel Venezuelan government in 2019, all measures strongly backed by Rubio, failed to overthrow Maduro, it appears that the secretary of state has concluded that direct military intervention is the only way to achieve this end, and that he is weighing heavily in favour of this outcome inside the administration.The prospect of US boots on the ground, however, still feels incongruous, especially given Washington’s many more pressing geopolitical interests and Trump’s repeated promise, to the applause of his MAGA base, that he will not drag the country into new “forever wars”. But this is the Western Hemisphere, not the distant Middle East. And in this new multipolar reality, which even Rubio now acknowledges, the return to traditional spheres of influence means the US is once again wielding a big stick in its hemisphere, openly reverting to the gunboat diplomacy that so often rocked the Caribbean in the early 20th century before the US was a global power.There is no understating the extent of the asymmetry of a potential war between the United States and Venezuela, nor the US capacity to easily overwhelm Venezuela’s conventional forces. But it would be mistaken to think an invasion of Venezuela would be a replay of Panama in 1989–1990 or Haiti in 1994, the last occasions the US occupied countries in its hemisphere. The 20th and 21st centuries were, of course, marred by constant overt and covert US meddling in the national politics of South American states. But unlike Central America and the Caribbean, where smaller and less powerful states became the testing ground for the rise of the US Marine Corps, Washington has never carried out an outright military intervention on the South American landmass. Venezuela, with about 28 million inhabitants, has roughly the same population as Iraq had in 2003 and more than 10 times that of Panama in 1990.It’s also important to bear in mind that even a weakened chavismo still commands a sizable and ardent base of support. Opposition to any US military intervention would likely be fierce, regardless of how the pro-government militias that have been mobilised over the last few weeks ultimately perform. Violent, US-supported regime change would almost certainly result in a long, protracted resistance and insurgency.Given the high risks of a land invasion, another scenario — one involving air strikes but without the amphibious landing of US soldiers on Venezuelan shores — appears more likely. Trump would surely prefer a one-off air strike along the lines of the June attack on Iran. But there is no reason to believe that such an attack would result in the mass uprising and military putsch that Rubio and his allies have been hoping for.The Venezuelan military has so far proven remarkably loyal to the Maduro government. It has weathered two decades of regime change attempts, including a brief coup in 2002, the 2019–2023 Guaido fiasco, which included an overt coup attempt in April 2019, and an ill-conceived mercenary incursion in 2020, each with fewer defections from its ranks than the last. In institutional terms, years of draconian US sanctions and destabilisation have hardened the Venezuelan security state and fostered a resilience that has taken many by surprise.We also shouldn’t be surprised if, when the first attack fails to produce the promised uprising, regime-change advocates demand another strike, then another. Convinced the government is on its last legs and needs just one more push, they would likely pressure Trump to keep bombing, and perhaps even support the formation of some form of armed opposition, currently nonexistent in Venezuela.Such a Libya-style proxy war would flood an already volatile region with more weapons and money. Criminal organisations and irregular armed groups already operating on Venezuela’s western border — and beyond, in neighbouring Colombia — would thrive in the chaos, swelling their ranks and profiting from arms and human trafficking: a nightmare scenario for Latin America.During the last few years of draconian US sanctions on Venezuela — which have significantly contributed to shortages of food, medicine and fuel — more than seven million Venezuelans have fled their country. This unprecedented wave of migration has had profound repercussions across the region and beyond, including in the US, where it has influenced the 2024 elections in Trump’s favour. If US sanctions produced such an exodus, we can only imagine the scale of the refugee crisis that would result from an actual war. It is no surprise that Brazil and Colombia, Venezuela’s most strategic neighbours from the point of view of any potential conflict, have strongly opposed a US military intervention.The bitter irony is inescapable: an operation justified by anti-narcotics rhetoric would create ideal conditions for drug-trafficking organisations to expand their power. The military build-up off Venezuela’s coast is a slippery slope towards an armed conflagration that could lead to far greater suffering for the Venezuelan people, a potential political quagmire for the United States, US troop casualties and the catastrophic destabilisation of much of the region.Follow Al Jazeera English:","headline":"The US warships off Venezuela aren’t there to fight drugs","level":"info","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/10/24/the-us-warships-off-venezuela-arent-there-to-fight-drugs","message":""},{"details":"So many lives in Gaza still hang in the balance.In different wards of Nasser Hospital lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour.Now that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.Ola Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son, Amar.  His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone.  It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed.\"He needs surgery urgently,\" Ola says, \"but it's complicated.  Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain haemorrhage.  He needs surgery in a well-equipped place.\"Right now, Gaza is anything but that.  After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.Sitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement.\"He's only 10 and, when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,\" she says.  A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health.\"Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,\" Shahd explains. \"One time he kept telling me, 'Shahd my head hurts', and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving.\"The one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed.\"We can't lose him. We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,\" Shahd says. \"When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.\"On Wednesday, the WHO co-ordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October.  It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan.  Some have stayed for care there.The UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded.  It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously.However, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas \"fulfils\" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"the most impactful measure\" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war.Top EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering \"financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed\".\"Hundreds of patients could be treated easily and efficiently in a short time if this route reopened to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and the hospitals in the West Bank,\" says Dr Fadi Atrash, CEO of the Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.\"We can at least treat 50 patients per day for chemotherapy and radiation and even more than that.  Other hospitals can do a lot of surgeries,\" the doctor told me.\"Referring them to East Jerusalem is the shortest distance, the most efficient way, because we have the mechanism. We speak the same language, we're the same culture, in many cases we have medical files for Gazan patients.  They've been receiving treatment in East Jerusalem hospitals for more than a decade before the war.\"The BBC asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's crossings, why the medical route was not being approved.  Cogat said it was a decision by the political echelon and referred queries to the prime minister's office, which did not offer further explanation.After the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel cited security reasons for not allowing Gazan patients in other Palestinian territories.  It also pointed out that its main crossing point for people at Erez had been targeted by Hamas fighters during the assault.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that in the year to August 2025, at least 740 people, including nearly 140 children, died while on waiting lists.At Nasser hospital, the director of paediatrics and maternity, Dr Ahmed al-Farra, expresses his frustration.\"It's the most difficult feeling for a doctor to be present, able to diagnose a condition but unable to carry out essential tests and lacking the necessary treatments,\" Dr al-Farra says. \"This has happened in so many cases, and unfortunately, there's daily loss of life due to our lack of capabilities.\"Since the ceasefire, hope has run out for more of his patients.In the past week in the hospital grounds, a funeral took place for Saadi Abu Taha, aged eight, who died from intestinal cancer.A day later, three-year old Zain Tafesh and Luay Dweik, aged eight, died from hepatitis.Without action, there are many more Gazans who will not have a chance to live in peace.Michael Smuss, an artist who helped make petrol bombs during the uprising, died in Israel aged 99.The US secretary of state says Israel must be comfortable with participants, but it is unclear how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.Humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher talk to the BBC about scenes of despair he witnessed on a recent trip to the costal enclave.Photographs show bodies with multiple signs of injury and wrists tied behind their backs.Vice-President Vance says the move by far-right lawmakers was \"stupid\", while   Secretary of State Rubio warns of the impact on Gaza peace plan.Copyright 2025 BBC.

A step closer to \"a true super-assistant\".But assistants, super or not, don't come free - and the company needs to start making a lot more money from its 800 million users.OpenAI says Atlas offers us an opportunity to \"rethink what it means to use the web\".It looks somewhat similar to Chrome or Apple's Safari to begin with, apart from the big difference - a sidebar chatbot.On a train booking website, it offered to \"highlight deals\" or compare prices with other places.I asked it to book me a train, but was told this is only available for paying ChatGPT customers.Later, I tried something simpler: I asked it to take me to an article I was reading the other day, but couldn't quite remember what website it was on.These are early days, but there's potential for big changes in how we use the internet.What's clear is this will be a premium product which will only work to its full capacity if you pay a subscription fee.Given we are so used to browsing the internet for free, this would require a lot of people to alter their habits quite dramatically.OpenAI's founding mission was to reach artificial general intelligence - roughly meaning an AI which can match human intelligence.So how does a browser help with that mission?It doesn't, really. But it could raise some revenue.The firm has convinced venture capitalists and investors to back it with billions of dollars - and at some point, it needs to start showing a return on that investment.In other words, it needs to make money.But raising money the internet's traditional way - advertising - might be a risk.\"OpenAI may be tempted to show ads to recoup costs and turn a profit, but it also must deliver a good user experience to stand out in a competitive market,\" said Stephanie Liu, a senior analyst at Forrester.OpenAI will be hoping its users will find it so good they are willing to start paying - but only about 5% of ChatGPT users pay for a subscription, according to the Financial Times.The other thing Atlas could do is give the firm access to a huge amount of user data.These kinds of AI tools are ultimately about scale - the more data you feed them, the thinking goes, the better they will become.The web is designed for humans to use, so if Atlas can monitor us - how we book train tickets for example - it can learn how to better navigate these kinds of processes.\"It remains to be seen how OpenAI will use users' data from Atlas, but for users who prefer anonymity and privacy, the browser may be too great of a risk,\" said Ms Liu.Then we get to the competition.Google Chrome is so dominant, authorities around the world have started raising eyebrows and words like \"monopoly\" are being thrown around.It won't be easy to muscle into that market.Google's Gemini AI is a part of the search engine now, while Microsoft has added Copilot into its Edge browser.Back in the early days of ChatGPT, some dubbed it the \"Google killer\" - a game-changer which would make online search as we know it redundant.That's not happened yet. But Erik Goins, founder of app developer Flywheel Studios, thinks it could.He said Google built its business on \"being the middleman between users and websites\", whereas ChatGPT is \"eliminating the middleman entirely\".\"You don't search for 'hotels in Miami' and click through Google results anymore,\" he said.\"You just ask ChatGPT and it connects you directly.\"Whether enough people are willing to pay for that little bit of extra convenience remains to be seen - and there's a long way to go before Google is toppled.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The other candidate seeking election, ex-cabinet minister Heather Humphreys, won 29.5%.“I will be a president who listens, who reflects and who speaks when it’s necessary. Together we can shape a new republic that values everybody,” Connolly said in a speech at Dublin Castle.Ireland’s president is largely a figurehead, with seldom-used powers to test the constitutionality of legislation, but often speaks on the global stage and welcomes other heads of state to the country.Many of Connolly’s views - from denouncing the EU’s plans to boost military spending to questioning the trustworthiness of the United States, Britain and France over their stance on the war in Gaza - are well to the left of many of the parties backing her, as well as outspoken incumbent Michael D Higgins.The former clinical psychologist and barrister is also one of the leading pro-Palestinian voices in parliament - a stance shared by government and most voters.Although Connolly served as deputy speaker of Ireland’s lower house after being first elected in 2016, her win was widely viewed as continuing the recent trend of choosing a more independent president based on the candidate’s values.She also benefited from dire campaigns from the two governing parties. Humphreys was not Fine Gael’s first choice. Fianna Fail’s pick, former Gaelic football coach Jim Gavin, abandoned his bid due to a financial scandal.The result was a boost to hopes among the previously divided left-wing opposition, led by Sinn Fein, of building a block capable of ending their center-right rivals’ century-long grip on power.Political analysts caution that such cohesion will be more challenging when the parties are in competition in a parliamentary election due by 2030. An Ireland Thinks polling-day survey found only 51% of Connolly voters would vote for a left-wing alliance.Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik said on Saturday the center-left party would have issues with a coalition led by Sinn Fein.A record 13% of voters also spoiled their votes, partly due to a planned protest by supporters of a conservative campaigner who failed to secure the required support from elected representatives to make the ballot.Prime Minister Micheal Martin said the government was open to reforming the nomination process.© 2025 Cable News Network.

Escalating trade tensions also have an impact.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents the UK's major supermarkets, said retailers were \"doing everything possible to keep food prices affordable\".\"But it's an uphill battle,\" she claimed, \"with over £7bn in additional costs in 2025 alone,\" citing higher taxes.The boss of Tesco, Ken Murphy, has previously said that \"enough is enough\" on business taxes.The UK's largest supermarket said the higher National Insurance rate had cost it £235m this year, however, Tesco has upgraded its earnings outlook for the year, with expectations of full-year profits of between £2.9bn and £3.1bn.Lidl revealed this week that its profits had surged threefold. Sales jumped by 7.9% as pre-tax profits hit £156.8m in the year to 28 February, up from £43.6m a year earlier.The chancellor has previously said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in her budget, though on Friday she refused to rule out raising income tax, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.Supermarket bosses highlighted that part of the government's business rates reforms posed a problem for the industry, in particular the so-called business rates surtax, which is being levied on all large commercial premises.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.In last year's Budget, the government announced its intention to introduce two lower figures used to calculate such rates for retail, hospitality and leisure properties with rateable values below £500,000.Meanwhile, firms with properties with rateable values at and above £500,000 will pay a higher amount, which the government says will include the majority of large distribution warehouses, such as those used by online retail giants Amazon.It is expected that the chancellor will confirm the rates businesses will have to pay at next month's Budget, along with further details, which will come into force in April 2026.But the UK's supermarkets have argued large retail premises were a \"tiny proportion of all stores, yet account for a third of retail's total business rates\".They urged the chancellor to \"ensure that the proposed changes to business rates result in a significant reduction to the industry's rates burden\".\"The chancellor has rightly made tackling inflation her top priority, and with food inflation stubbornly high, ensuring retail's rates burden doesn't rise further would be one of the simplest ways to help,\" said Ms Dickinson.The Treasury said that business rates would be adjusted to reflect changes in the overall value of the tax base, \"so that the system continues to raise the same amount of revenue in real terms\".\"If the total value of rateable properties increases, the tax rate will generally fall,\" it added. \"This means that even if a specific property's RV goes up, its bill could still decrease if the reduction in the tax rate is large enough to offset the increase in value.\"Ultimately, what businesses pay after a revaluation depends on both the new RVs and the adjusted tax rate.\"The Chancellor is reportedly trying to revive plans to cut the tax-free limit for Cash ISAs.Chancellors rarely reveal tax plans before the Budget, but Reeves has softened her language on raising income tax.Frances Boyd says she is now weighing up offers of paid work from Waitrose and Asda for her son Tom.Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her economic plans in her second Budget on 26 November.Tom Boyd's mum says she is \"overwhelmed\" after he is offered a job by rival supermarket chain Asda.Copyright 2025 BBC.

He says the only way he has managed to stay in the industry was by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own stores to reach consumers directly.But he acknowledged that most ranchers do not have the money to make that shift. Many have left the industry - and see no incentive to jump back in.\"We're not going to rebuild this cow herd - not until we address market concentration,\" Mr Callicrate says.He adds that he supported the Agriculture Department's plans to open up more cattle grazing land.\"But unless we have a market\", anyone would be a \"fool to get into the cattle business\", he says.Bill Bullard found himself in the first wave of ranchers pushed out as the meat processing industry started to consolidate in the early 1980s.He closed down his 300-cow operation in South Dakota in 1985.Now the chief executive of R-CALF USA, a cattle producer trade association, he says it was only in the last year or so that ranchers had received good prices for their livestock, as supply dropped to such a low level that the prices paid by meat processors \"simply had to increase\".Still, reliance on imports and meat packers' buying power persists, Mr Bullard says, meaning ranchers \"lack confidence in the integrity of the marketplace\" and remain reluctant to grow their herds.He says he does not have confidence that the president's ideas would fix the issues.\"He's focused on the symptoms and not the problems.\"Some wait until a certain date to reach for the thermostat.

However, no long-range missile deliveries were announced at the summit.Zelensky has long argued that US-made Tomahawks and European missiles would help make the war costs heavier for Moscow by hitting key military targets – including oil refineries and weapons depots – deep inside Russia.But during last week's talks in Washington, US President Donald Trump indicated to Zelensky that he was not ready to supply Tomahawks.On Thursday, Putin warned that if \"such weapons are used to strike Russian Federation territory the response will be... overwhelming\".Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Speaking at a joint press conference after the London summit, Sir Keir said Putin was \"not serious about peace\", and therefore Ukraine's allies agreed a \"clear plan for the rest of the year\" on supporting Ukraine.The UK prime minister said this also included targeting Russia's sovereign assets to \"unlock billions to help finance Ukraine's defence\". He gave no further details.On Thursday, EU leaders agreed to help support Ukraine's \"financial needs\" for the next two years - but stopped short of agreeing to use frozen Russian assets worth €140bn (£122bn).Asked about a so-called \"reparations loan\" for Ukraine funded by the Russian assets, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she hoped a decision would be made by Christmas Eve.In London, the \"coalition of the willing\" also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defences\" amid almost daily Russian air assaults on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure.Zelensky warned that Russia \"wants to make the winter cold a tool of torment\", adding: \"They want to break us.\"Comments by the leaders in London will be disappointing for those who were hoping to hear specific examples of how Kyiv's allies were planning to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine.No doubt, a lot of the words said will be pleasing to the Ukrainian ear. For example, Sir Keir said the UK and Ukraine's other allies were prepared to ratchet up pressure on Moscow.But there were no concrete examples of how exactly the allies were planning to force a change on the battlefield or force Putin to the negotiating table.In Ukraine, several people who spoke to the BBC said they were more focused on everyday problems, rather than following Zelensky's trip to the UK.Yana Kolomiets, from Odesa, said there was a lack of electricity, heating and water in the southern city.\"The more scary thing is that the Russians started launching guided bombs on our region,\" she added.Tetiana Dankevych, from the capital Kyiv, said power outages and a problems with water supplies caused by Russian strikes were making life \"very difficult\".\"I don't have a feeling this war will end soon,\" she said.Further support for Ukraine's energy infrastructure was among the issues discussed at the London summit - however, no specific announcements were made.Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also took part in the London meeting, while other leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - participated via a video link.Ukraine and its Western allies have publicly agreed with Trump's proposal that the fighting should be immediately frozen along the vast front line for negotiations to begin.Russia has rejected this idea, repeating demands that Kyiv and its allies describe as de facto capitulation by Ukraine.Earlier on Friday, Zelensky held talks with King Charles at Windsor – their third meeting this year.Needyanand Raya says continued his doctoral studies following a decades-long break to keep a promise.Katie McConnell says she struggled to get life insurance and mortgage protection when buying a home.The Tower's wartime and postwar history will be told as part of the Flights, Camera, Action! event.Terry Fleming, 81, tells other potential victims: \"However smooth and nice they seem, they're not.\"The strikes came as Russian air defences destroyed a drone heading towards Moscow, the city's mayor said.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Whereas almost all EU countries have diversified their energy mix away from Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Hungary’s dependence has deepened. Along with Slovakia, its fellow antiliberal Central European neighbor, Hungary is almost totally reliant on Russia for its oil imports.Orbán is now reckoning with the grim consequences of his own energy policy. Alongside Washington’s oil sanctions, the EU on Thursday confirmed it would ban Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from 2027. Last month, Orbán told Trump that, without Russian energy imports, Hungary’s economy would be brought “to its knees.”Against what he decries as the bland uniformity of Brussels, Orbán says he stands for “sovereignty” – Hungary’s right to chart its own course within the EU and forge ties with hardline leaders abroad. But Orbán’s quest for sovereignty – spurning EU efforts to diversify its energy supplies – has left his country perilously dependent on one country for fossil fuels.The double blow of US oil sanctions and the LNG ban comes as Orbán, Europe’s longest-serving prime minister, is struggling to contain Hungary’s surging opposition movement led by Peter Magyar, a former Orbán loyalist-turned-arch-rival. While Orbán had hoped a Trump-Putin summit could shore up his support at home, he now faces a deepening economic crisis that could weaken his hand before a crucial election in the spring.After Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, EU countries moved to slash Russian energy imports to cut off a major source of the Kremlin’s revenue. However, Brussels gave Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic an exemption from a ban on Russian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Russia.Instead, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Hungary increased its Russian crude oil reliance from 61% pre-invasion to 86% in 2024. So far this year, 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports have been from Russia. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).By May, Hungary and Slovakia’s crude oil purchases had sent the Kremlin 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion), the report found, saying this was “the equivalent of the cost of purchasing 1,800 Iskander-M missiles that have been used to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure and kill Ukrainian civilians.”The crude oil imports flow through the Druzhba pipeline, which has been repeatedly attacked this summer by Ukrainian drones, in an effort by Kyiv to punish its neighbors for helping to fund Moscow’s war.The CSD-CREA report said that Hungary could diversify its energy supplies, receiving non-Russian oil through Croatia’s Adria pipeline rather than Druzhba.But Orbán has shown no sign of changing tack. In an interview with Hungarian state radio Friday, he said his government was “working on how to circumvent” the US sanctions, without providing further details.Top Russian envoy visits US for ‘official’ talks, days after Trump imposes sanctions on MoscowHungary’s intent to find workarounds to the US sanctions could provide the first major test of the Trump administration’s seriousness about enforcing them, said Elina Ribakova, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank based in Washington, DC.Despite harsh rhetoric towards Russia from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the decision to impose new sanctions on Russia was due to “Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war” in Ukraine, Trump has been less abrasive, saying he hoped the sanctions “won’t be on for long.” The US president also left the door open to the Budapest summit, saying “we’ll do it in the future.”The success of the sanctions on Russia’s oil majors will depend on how they are enforced, including against a Trump ally like Orbán, Ribakova told CNN.“Which will it be: A friendly Putin-Trump meeting in Hungary, or throwing Hungary’s administration under the bus if they try to evade sanctions?” she said. “I have no idea which way the cards will fall here.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

Brentford were superior in every aspect, and had Liverpool somehow rescued a point it would have been grand larceny.Slot focused on the number of long balls the Reds  have had to cope with, along with deep-lying defensive strategies, as a reason behind their dramatic fall from grace which brought a fourth successive Premier League defeat.Apart from publicly flagging this up as a potential area of weakness in his Liverpool side, the Dutchman now needs to turn his attention to the desperate efforts of his own players, who were vulnerable, exposed, flat and thoroughly out of sorts.They offered not one redeeming feature as they slumped again, the visiting fans suffering as they made their way home from a freezing west London night.They have now lost as many Premier League games this term as in their entire title-winning campaign, becoming only the fourth reigning champions to lose four consecutive games after Leicester in 2016-17 (5), Liverpool themselves in 2020-21 (4) and Manchester City last season (4).This was also the first time they have lost four consecutive league games since February 2021, proving Slot must find the cure for this malaise on his own doorstep as opposed to looking elsewhere.Brentford hold onto win as Liverpool face fourth consecutive league lossIf he was aware of how opponents attempt to unlock Liverpool, then he would hardly have been surprised that a long throw hurled in by Brentford's Michael Kayode exposed their soft underbelly after only five minutes, Dango Ouatarra scoring from Kristoffer Ajer's flick-on.Liverpool quite simply, were outplayed. And awful. They fell to set-pieces and counter-attacks - in other words the same old story this term.Brentford's own outstanding display under a leader of growing stature in Keith Andrews must not ignored, but the drop in standards from the Anfield outfit has been alarming.The Bees were able to run through them with ease, unsettling them at every turn, Mikkel Damsgaard's magnificent through-ball releasing Kevin Schade for a classy second goal.Liverpool had concerns everywhere, from established performers of the past to expensive new acquisitions who were simply not up to scratch.Virgil van Dijk cannot escape the scrutiny, his partnership on the left side of Liverpool's defence with the struggling £40m Milos Kerkez an uneasy alliance, and the captain exchanging quizzical glances with the Hungarian in the first half.It was Van Dijk who brought down Outarra on the line of the penalty area to concede the spot-kick from which Igor Thiago effectively sealed the success for Brentford.The Dutchman has been a central figure of a defence that has creaked all season.It was another disappointing night for Liverpool's £116m signing Florian Wirtz, who was replaced by defender Joe Gomez late on.Since the start of May, Liverpool have conceded 2+ goals in more Premier League games than any other side with nine, while they have conceded 14 goals in their nine league games this season. In the previous campaign they did not concede their 14th goal until their 16th game.Liverpool's midfield was non-existent, while hope that £116m Florian Wirtz had sparked into life with an improved performance in the 5-1 Champions League win at Eintracht Frankfurt was extinguished here.The German missed a glorious first-half chance and then replaced by a defender, Joe Gomez, with seven minutes left and Brentford 3-1 up.It was quite the verdict from Slot on the influence and impact of his summer signing. The verdict from Brentford's supporters was predictable as he departed, to chants of \"what a waste of money\".Mohamed Salah showed one flash of the old brilliance to give Liverpool hope they did not deserve in a frantic finale, but it was otherwise another poor performance from one of the club's all-time greats, who is struggling for confidence and inspiration.It was also a night of little reward for striker Hugo Ekitike, the one summer arrival who has flourished, as he had no service worthy of the name in the absence of the injured £125m buy Alexander Isak and midfielder Ryan Gravenberch.Slot could not hide from the evidence before his own eyes as he told BBC's Match of the Day: \"It was a disappointing result and a disappointing performance as well.\"Conceding three goals is far too much if you want to win a game of football. First one was a set-piece, second is a counter-attack which is one of the things Brentford are really good at.\"What I have to do is look at what we do wrong and what we do right. I have a clear idea of where we have to improve, but that hasn't been the case in other games. We didn't do the basics right.\"Slot will have to find the answers and quickly.Liverpool's next four games are against Crystal Palace at Anfield in the last 16 of the Carabao Cup, before another home league game against Aston Villa. Real Madrid then come to Anfield in the Champions League, before a visit to Manchester City - where you can be sure Erling Haaland will be licking his lips if he faces a defence as feeble as this.Liverpool have a team with quality, but no shape, with Wirtz still trying to fit in, offering encouragement to any opponents with ambition. The near-£450m spend in the summer has not yet offered anything in the way of improvement or progress.At the moment, given their struggles, Liverpool's much-discussed blip appears to be getting that victory at Eintracht Frankfurt - unthinkable when you recall their smooth progress last season and finishing 10 points clear in top spot.For Slot and Liverpool, this was a chastening experience and further disappointment could follow should Arsenal beat Crystal Palace on Sunday to increase the gap between them to seven points.Liverpool couldn't get the basics right - SlotLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?New Zealand beat England by four wickets in first ODI - reactionWomen's World Cup: England on top as they restrict NZ to 157-7England beaten by NZ despite outrageous Brook tonMark Bonnar can't trust anyone in this twist-filled thrillerExplore Bruce Springsteen's remarkable life storyThe drama continues in the ultimate game of deceitBeneath the surface of the scratch card's inventionAwful & outplayed - Slot must look closer to home to end Liverpool slumpAfter 11 months of negativity, have Man Utd turned the corner?914 miles, 185 fans - doing English football's longest away dayBrentford hold on to secure deserved win over Liverpool.

He and his wife Weena, 32, now have a six-year-old daughter, Sophia.\"When you have a kid you're like, it would have been nice to have those photos now - to save them for her.\"Sophia will never be able to see the pictures of her parents when they first met.For Stephen, this was a moment of realisation that digital photos don't always stand the test of time. So he decided to start making physical albums for her.He's documented her life as a newborn - featuring her hospital tag and ink prints of her tiny feet - as well as one for each year of her childhood so far.And he's currently putting together an album which will show her life as a five-year-old. Earlier this week he ordered 300 photographs to be printed.This is nothing new - people have been compiling photo albums and scrapbooks for more than 100 years. But what should you think about if you want to keep your photos safe?Experts broadly agree you should keep three versions of your most treasured pictures: the original on your phone, one copy online, and one on a hard drive.Some even suggest going one step further - printing them out.In a digital world, preserving information is everyone's problem.Last week the UK government told businesses they should have contingency plans on paper in case of cyber-attacks. And just days ago, a problem with Amazon Web Services disrupted more than 1,000 businesses globally.Christopher Barnatt, a former computing and future studies lecturer and YouTuber, says this is why we should think about making physical copies of all important documents - for example birth certificates, insurance papers and passports.Photos are arguably no different. And there are plenty of tools we can use to protect them.One obvious step is to back them up onto an online cloud service like Apple's iCloud or Google Photos. Smartphones often do this automatically.But there are issues like space and cost.iCloud has a limit of 5GB - which covers photos as well as iPhone backups and other app data. After that, iCloud charges UK users £0.99 per month for up to 50GB of space. Google Photos offers 15GB - shared with the user's Gmail and Google Drive content - before charging.While these services are very stable, they are not totally risk-free.Earlier this year, a woman in North Carolina told the WBTV news outlet her iCloud account was hacked and her password changed. She lost access to her photos and videos and said Apple told her there was nothing they could do about it.You don't have to be hacked though. If you're really unlucky you might forget your password and be unable to restore it - meaning you can't log back into your cloud service.It's probably safer to keep your photos on a cloud service than on social media.\"A lot of people use social media almost like a diary. Social media platforms are set up to sort of serialise people's lives and [create] narratives,\" says Dr Esperanza Miyake of the University of Strathclyde, who researches how social media companies treat people's data.In 2019, a server migration by MySpace - which was once the most popular social media platform in the world - resulted in the loss of 12 years' worth of music uploads.They were \"all gone\", says Dr Miyake.The company apologised for the data loss.There can be a cost issue, too. Earlier this month Snapchat announced it would start charging people for storing photos and videos on their messaging app, much to the annoyance of some users.Snapchat said 5GB of storage would remain free, but after that users would be charged $1.99 (£1.48) per month for up to 100GB of space.Prof Winters suggests there will always be a problem with treating commercial platforms as archives. \"They don't have an archival function. They're commercial entities.\"The assumption that we will always be able to keep uploading every single photo we take and have it preserved in perpetuity by a commercial entity is one that's going to be tested.\"This is why downloading photos and keeping them on an external device like a hard drive or memory card is a good idea.You shouldn't have to worry about images becoming unreadable for a very long time - thanks to \"robust\" image file formats like jpeg, according to Prof Winters.Many hard drives work for up to 10 years - with some lasting for 20 - so it's important to move your pictures to new hard drives as the decades pass.If you've got your three copies of your photos, you're in a good place. But what about printing them out?Despite the risks of fire, water damage, or simply being misplaced, it's still a genuinely durable way of passing down memories through the generations.Dr Barnatt and Dr Miyake say people who grew up with social media and mobile phones should keep offline copies of their most beloved items.\"It's about valuing what's important to you before it's too late,\" says Prof Winters.If you start thinking about printing out your digital archive too late in life, \"you may have lost the things you value already\".South African Thendo Muloiwa has decided to do just that, at the age of 28.He loves the photo albums his parents made for him when he was a young child and wants to do the same with the digital pictures he has snapped using his phone. They show the places he has been, and the friends he has made during his 20s.Some archivists and futurists see this return to print as a way to counter a \"digital dark age\" - the idea that photos, videos and text might become unreadable as technology changes.But Prof Winters thinks those claims are overblown, pointing to major international efforts to preserve more and more digital and online internet.For many people, printing photos is more than just about documenting history.Thendo says there is a particular joy people share when looking through a photo album together and chatting.\"You can't really do that on your phone,\" Thendo says. \"Sure, you can open up your iCloud or whatever and scroll through all your photos, but you're going to find a lot of random pictures.\"As opposed to a photo album where you would have the perfect picture that you have picked and put in there - that's the difference.\"The best images sent to us from Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and Oxfordshire.Jess Farnham, 24, said swapping her smartphone for an old-style flip-phone was \"life changing\".Oxford professor Charles Spence has been investigating why the confectionary crazes kick off.There are 72 nominees in total, who have a combined following of more than 83 million followers.A free cyber health check is aiming to combat cyber crime for businesses in Jersey.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Nintendo's hybrid Switch console has been even more successful.Microsoft has instead been pushing a strategy of being able to play its games in more places, including on PCs, tablets, phones, and its new handheld console, the ROG Xbox Ally.This has included promoting its subscription service Game Pass, where a monthly charge gets players access to a library of games, similar in style to services like Netflix and Disney+.While there's long been rivalry between PlayStation and Xbox players, some fans of the Halo series are happy to see it reach more people.YouTuber Kara, who streams under the name @Eldeeable, tells BBC Newsbeat that Halo's been a big part of her life.\"Combat Evolved was one of the first games I ever played on Xbox,\" she says.\"I played it with my little brother split-screen and I loved it.\"She says the announcement is \"massive\" and \"broke the internet a little bit\".Some Xbox owners have criticised Microsoft for not keeping Halo as an exclusive game, but it reflects a broader move away from exclusivity - with PlayStation releasing games from its The Last Of Us and Horizon series on PC, and even Nintendo making some games with its characters available on mobile phones.For Kara, this shouldn't be seen as a bad thing.\"I know there's a bit of controversy about it coming to PlayStation, but I don't see any reason why it should be like that at all\", she says.\"I just think it's a win for all gamers.\"The game's executive producer Damon Conn agrees, promising that the remake will appeal to old and new fans.\"At its heart, Halo is about connection, we're thrilled to meet a new generation of players on their platforms of choice to fall in love with Halo the same way we did,\" he says.\"We're not trying to rewrite Halo's legacy - we're trying to immerse you in it like never before.\"Additional reporting by Georgia Levy-Collins and Peter Gillibrand.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.Data centres were billed as a boon to Virginia’s economy.

Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth almost £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small, white magnesium tablets a second.\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now? Why has it become so popular?\"\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.It might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.It is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"Take sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\"Copyright 2025 BBC.

One of the key things for mental health is being able to get outside for a walk.\"Stewart says using the Orkney library system to offer light lamps is the ideal solution.\"It's great as another strand of what the library does,\" he adds.\"The library is such a good thing for mental health anyway, it might be miserable and grey on Orkney, but you can be transported anywhere within the pages of a book.\"In Ireland, libraries in Dublin are also preparing to trial the scheme.It has also inspired a new five-part series Winter Well on BBC Radio 4.Prof Parr says the project has found that use of therapeutic lamps, alongside new outdoor routines and \"programmatic encouragement\" to notice natural light, really does make a difference for people with Sad.Safety in New Friends hosts a number of events from walks, talks and bowling.Lisa Wolff says \"horrendous decisions\" by mental health staff contributed to her daughter's suicide.The bench has been installed at the Humber Bridge Country Park to provide mental health support.A coroner says Abbigail Smith was discharged despite a \"real and immediate risk to her life\".More 16-24 year olds in England say they have symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder - BBC analysis finds.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Cmdr. Keith Stewart, a former US naval aviator, noted that the Fujian’s deck layout limits simultaneous takeoffs and landings.In a major step forward, China has built the Fujian with an electromagnetic catapult aircraft launching system – which allows aircraft to take off with heavier weapon and fuel loads so they can strike enemy targets from greater distances. Only the US fleet’s newest and biggest carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, can match it.That flight deck configuration is a first for a Chinese carrier. Its first two carriers – the Liaoning and the Shandong – use a ski jump-style ramp to get aircraft airborne under their own power.Configuring a new type of carrier from scratch may have led to the limitations.The issue of the Fujian’s ability to conduct air operations was first raised after a Chinese military blogger watched a video about the Chinese military on state-run CCTV, which featured a segment on the Fujian.After watching the documentary, the blogger, writing on the military commentary blog Haishixianfeng, said: “Both of the catapults are situated close to the middle-front section of the landing area, so either the J-15 or J-35 (China’s two carrier-based fighter jets) would roll over the catapults when they land, temporarily preventing them from being used for launch operations and thus affecting the takeoff efficiency of the fighter jets.”The comments were picked up by South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper, and CNN asked the two former US Navy officers to review that report and the video.Schuster said the angle at which the landing area crosses the Fujian’s deck is only 6 degrees off center, compared with 9 degrees on the US carriers, limiting space between the landing strip and the forward two catapults.Additionally, the Fujian’s landing area is longer than that of the Nimitz, meaning it extends too close to the bow area where aircraft are positioned for catapult-assisted launching, he said.The “longer landing area and the narrower deck angle reduces the space for repositioning the recovered aircraft,” Schuster said.The US officers also noted that the forward catapults seem to be longer on the Fujian than the Nimitz.Essentially, aircraft would be at risk of flight deck collisions as they move to and from elevators to the hangar deck below for takeoffs and landings, Schuster and Stewart said.The only option is to reduce the pace of flight deck operations to try to prevent flight deck mishaps, they said.China has been building the world’s largest navy, launching high-tech warships at a frenetic pace under the leadership of Xi Jinping, putting pressure on the United States and its Pacific allies to keep pace.But when it comes to aircraft carriers, the US has a large lead, at least in numbers, with 11 active carriers to China’s two, with the Fujian’s activation expected in the coming weeks.The Liaoning and the Shandong are smaller – displacing 60,000 to 70,000 tons – and their launch system limits the weapons and fuel load of aircraft.Displacing 80,000 tons, the Fujian is the closest thing afloat to the US Navy’s 97,000-ton Nimitz-class carriers, which make up 10 of the 11 carriers in the US fleet.The USS Nimitz, commissioned in May 1975, is the oldest carrier in the US fleet. Earlier this month, it entered the South China Sea via the Singapore Strait, according to the USNI News, on what is expected to be its last deployment before decommissioning next year.Meanwhile, satellite imagery from late September showed Fujian docked at Hainan island in the northern part of the South China Sea, where its commissioning ceremony is expected soon.The carrier movements come as US President Donald Trump heads to the region, with stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea in the next few days.The Fujian has gotten high praise in Chinese state media, with Chinese military affairs expert Zhang Junshe last month telling Global Times that successful launch trials in it show “China is becoming a major aircraft carrier power, with both the carrier and its aircraft achieving world-class in key metrics.”“This not only showed that the PLA has fully mastered and matured the application of complex electromagnetic catapults, but also reflected the continuous improvement in the capability and proficiency of naval personnel in operating high-tech equipment,” Zhang is quoted as saying.Schuster said the Fujian is more likely a stepping stone, and China’s next carrier, the Type 004, on which early construction is believed to have begun, will incorporate lessons learned from it.Meanwhile, Stewart said the carrier ops are one place China has a lot to learn, especially since Fujian is its first carrier with a catapult system.China’s aircraft carriers send message in the open Pacific for the first time – and bigger and more powerful ships are coming“There is an old Navy proverb which states ‘all carrier operational rules and regulations are written in blood,’ which means somebody was either seriously injured or killed during flight ops,” Stewart said.“I’ve seen several folks killed on flight decks and know just how dangerous an arena it can be.“Building a shiny new carrier is nice, but I would postulate that the Chinese ‘don’t know what they don’t know’ about carrier ops,” he said.That can only be learned by practice in all kinds of conditions, according to Stewart.“Flying off a carrier in daylight and good weather is not too difficult. The hard part, and what makes flyers pucker their cheeks, is flying and landing on a nasty, rainy, windy night when the deck is wallowing up to 18 feet, you are low on fuel, and you are scared.“If anybody tells you that they’ve never been scared during night ops, they are delusional,” Stewart said.© 2025 Cable News Network.

a two-day, ticketed event at Manchester's high-capacity Mayfield Depot.Attendees reported that crowds were small, and Abbie says the event was not considered successful.Contractor Chris O'Connor worked at Manchester Pride for five years as a runner, a role he describes as a mixture of organisation and \"troubleshooter-slash-firefighter\".He says working in the run-up to previous Pride weekends had been \"a joy\", but that 2025 had presented \"red flags\" and \"major issues\" for him to resolve from the start.He believes Manchester Pride, which reported a loss of about £468,000 in 2023, should have had better control of the finances.Both Chris and Abbie say they are still owed money for their work on 2025's event.In Chris's case, he says not being paid prevented him visiting his son, who has just started university in Ireland.Saki Yew tells Newsbeat she has \"a life outside of drag\" and \"bills and groceries to pay for\".Like Chris, Saki believes Pride's organisers could have been more transparent about their financial troubles while people waited for payment.\"It's highly disrespectful,\" says Saki.\"You've kept us in the dark, you've just disrespected every single person on what they do and what they provide for you.\"Some suspect the lack of communication from Manchester Pride's organisers over payment is linked to its failed bid to host 2028's Europride.The international event usually attracts huge crowds, and Abbie believes Pride bosses were banking on \"the funding that would have come with that from Manchester City Council and beyond\".When it was announced that Limerick and Clare, in Ireland, had won the bid earlier this month, hopes for potential Europride investment disappeared.\"I think they took a massive swing and it was a miss,\" says Abbie.The exact details of the circumstances leading up to Manchester Pride going into liquidation aren't yet known.However, the Charity Commission, which works to ensure organisations in England and Wales comply with the law, is \"assessing concerns\" after Pride's bosses submitted a \"serious incident report relating to its finances\".There are also questions about future events in Manchester, and what shape they will take.On the streets of the city, it's not hard to find people who attended this year's Pride and want to see the celebration return.Kieran, 24, from Oldham, believes \"it's something that everyone in Manchester looks forward to\".\"It brings all types of culture and people together,\" he says.Lexi agrees Pride is \"a big part of not only the culture of this city, but so important for the community itself\".\"If we don't have Pride, what else do we have?\"Lexi says attending Pride events after she'd just come out was \"a really important time\" and \"it would be horrible for people to lose that opportunity\".Manchester City Council has said it will \"support a new chapter for Manchester Pride weekend, which will take place next August\".Lexi is optimistic.\"I would be happy to put my money into something, especially if it's going to go back to the community,\" she says.There had been complaints about staging events outside Manchester's gay village and focusing on spectacle over supporting LGBTQ+ causes.\"Maybe there's a way around it in creating a cheaper, more sustainable Pride,\" Lexi hopes.But for the workers that may depend on, trust has been lost as well as money.\"This charity is there to platform and support queer artists and practitioners,\" says Abbie.\"For all of those people to be at a loose end when this is the charity that is meant to raise them up more than anybody - that's where it's deeply frustrating and really upsetting.\"The BBC approached Manchester Pride for comment but it did not respond.In a statement shared on social media, Manchester Pride's Board of Trustees expressed \"regret\" for delays in communication, but said it was \"keen not to jeopardise financial opportunities while our discussions were ongoing\".It said it had hoped to find a way to continue to support those who had contributed, and was \"sincerely sorry for those who will now lose out financially from the current situation\".\"We have put our hearts and souls into the celebration and community activities over two decades,\" it added.\"We hope and believe that this leaves a positive and lasting legacy for the Pride movement in Greater Manchester.\"Additional reporting by Georgia Levy-Collins.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

Paparazzi cameras outside documented every second of the now-infamous night in 2007, later following her with her new buzzcut to get a tattoo.The star said she did it because she felt cornered and humiliated by the paparazzi, who had chased her from the house of her estranged husband, Kevin Federline.In the midst of an acrimonious and widely publicised custody battle for their two young boys, the Princess of Pop said she acted out in defiance and wanted to give the press \"some material\". She called it an impulsive decision - one that to her, served as a public rebuke to a world she felt held her to untenable standards.To her, it was a \"desperate move by a desperate person\".But to her estranged husband, it was a wake-up call to \"just how far things had spiralled out of control\".Decades later, those moments and the others that went on to define the pop star and her very public unravelling are back in the limelight - but what exactly happened and why depends on who is doing the retelling.After Spears shared her outlook in her 2023 memoir, The Woman In Me, Federline is now speaking out and sharing his take on their years together in a book released this week, titled You Thought You Knew.Like Spears, Federline's book details their intimate and chaotic relationship, the mental anguish they both suffered and provides an inside glimpse at the conservatorship battle that dictated much of Spears' life and career. It provides a side-by-side look, a he-said, she-said dissection of their lives.The Grammy Award winner, 43, has already denounced her ex's memoir, writing on social media that Federline's revelations have been \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\".But the dancer-turned-reality TV star says he's releasing You Thought You Knew after years of hesitation because he does not want his children growing up \"feeling like they have to explain who their father is\".Federline responds to the stories and accusations that Spears tells in her 2023 tome, in which she describes being financially and emotionally controlled by those closest to her. He contradicts her account at times, levying fresh accusations.Despite both memoirs offering vastly different accounts at times, both have a similar aim in reframing the public narrative thrust upon them by illuminating the episodes that led to Spears' conservatorship battle, as well as the nationwide movement that freed the pop star in 2021.In her book, Spears condemned the court-ordered conservatorship, also known as a guardianship, which she was under from 2008-2021. During that time, her father, Jamie Spears, was in control of her finances, career and many aspects of her personal life.She says that if she was just left to live her life, she would have worked it out.\"Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick,\" she wrote.But, she added, she resolved to go along with the protracted arrangement \"for the sake of my sons,\" even though \"being in it was really hard\".After the conservatorship ended, her father Jamie Spears said it had been \"necessary\" to protect her, but it was time for her to have control back.In his recounting, Federline has a different take. Even when the marriage tanked, it wasn't easy for him to \"watch her spiral\", he writes.Federline supported the arrangement, arguing that it provided \"some semblance of normalcy\" for their two boys together. After her psychiatric hold, Federline says he immediately filed for sole custody, but that set into motion a slew of issues that exacerbated Spears' relationship with their children.His ex, he writes \"saw the events in her life through a prism that painted her as the victim, the misunderstood one, the person wronged by everyone around her.\"But from where I stood, she needed help. Whether that was rehab or therapy, I couldn't say for sure,\" he writes, noting that she was in no state to manage her own affairs and needed some form of oversight or \"protective layer\".He adds that he came to find out that there was a lot he didn't know about the conservatorship, and he did not push for answers because part of him \"doesn't want to know\".Spears has credited the viral Free Britney movement with helping her find the courage to challenge and eventually escape her conservatorship.\"The fact that my friends and my fans sensed what was happening and did all that for me, that's a debt I can never repay,\" she wrote, thanking them for standing up for her when she couldn't stand up for herself.But Federline says the movement \"got it wrong\" and those who are part of it now need to put the same effort into a \"Save Britney movement\". He shares ominous concerns about how the pop star is currently \"racing toward something irreversible\" and \"getting close to the 11th hour\".The pressure from the Free Britney movement, he alleges, led the judge on her conservatorship case \"to ignore the professional reports and cave to public opinion\".\"But none of that truly mattered in the end. If Britney believed she was being held against her will, and everything else she's shared since, then that trauma is real for her. And you can't ignore that,\" he says.Spears has continued to make headlines with strange and sometimes concerning posts on Instagram. Their boys are grown up but, according to Federline, they have haven't seen their mother much, and they don't really want to. Federline has four additional children, along with the two with Spears.Federline says he has lost faith that things will ever fully turn around for his ex-wife.\"I still hope that Britney can find peace. Whatever her future holds, I hope it's one where she can finally take control of her own life, on her own terms. This whole saga, twenty years of it, was built on denial. Britney never reached the first step of recovery: admitting there was a problem.\"Spears has laid blame on many people who were once close to her, including two of her exes, Federline and former NSYNC frontman Justin Timberlake.She accuses both of ruining her ability to \"trust people again\".In his own memoir, Federline says he was making a career for himself as a professional dancer who worked with Michael Jackson and NSYNC when he crossed paths with Spears.The couple had met before, when Federline was dancing on a tour for Spears' opening act.Federline, for his part, is self-aware, writing that he knows people viewed the Fresno, California, native as \"this dude jumped out of his trailer and into Britney's mansion\".But even the day before their wedding, there was a shadow over the relationship, he says.Federline contends in his book that when he and Spears got together in their early 20s, she had never really moved on from her ex-boyfriend Timberlake, detailing that they had a lot of \"unfinished business\" and that \"it lingered, like a ghost in the background of our relationship\".In her memoir, Spears recounted the pitfalls of her relationship with Timberlake, including him asking her to have an abortion and the public embarrassment that befell her after he accused her of cheating - further heightened when he cast a Spears lookalike in his music video for Cry Me a River.Their relationship, which lasted from 1999 to 2002, has also been dissected over the years and has come with a public apology from Timberlake, after several documentaries about Spears recast her as a victim in her conservatorship.Federline says that \"there was always something there with Justin that she couldn't let go of\". He says Spears even called Timberlake the night before their wedding to get closure.\"Now, looking back... I realise it was deeper than that. She never really got over him,\" he writes.Federline's memoir has raised the ire of Spears, and her vocal army of online supporters.James Miller, an activist and Free Britney proponent, says the book will not help the singer.\"Britney does struggle with mental health problems, that's pretty obvious,\" he told the BBC. \"Exploiting her right now really isn't the best time. I don't think there's any alarm to sound.\"From breaking out on The Mickey Mouse Club as a child star to dancing with a snake around her shoulders at the MTV Music Video Awards, Spears has lived her whole adult life in the spotlight.S Mark Young, a professor at the University of Southern California and author of The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism is Seducing America, says Federline's book is unlikely to change people's minds about her.\"I think after this coming week, the book will die. Most people who follow Britney will not be moved,\" he says.Some have wondered why Federline, 47, has chosen to speak out now.\"No one heals when a book like this is written,\" Mr Young says.Mr Miller, and many online, have noted that now that their sons are both over 18, Federline would no longer be receiving a $40,000-per-month payment from the singer to support them.Federline denies having an ulterior motive beyond wanting to finally share his side of this infamous saga.In the memoir, Federline says the book was his best chance at sharing his side of the story.For decades, the media, Spears and her family have mostly told Federline's story, largely leaning into his \"bad boy\" persona and making him the butt of many late-night jokes.\"This is about finally telling my story,\" he writes in his book. \"My version. In my words. Because everybody else has done it for me. The media. The blogs. The exes. The strangers. The jokes. The headlines. They all had something to say about me. And I stayed quiet.\"He denies that he ever \"was just coasting off her money\" and insists he has always been \"out there hustling, grinding, investing - working to build a solid foundation for myself and my kids\".This opportunity was a way for him to finally share his side after decades of stories, gossip, rumours and accusations - which he says he avoided responding to in hopes of giving his family and children \"some kind of normal life\".\"But silence didn't bring peace,\" he writes. \"It left me choking on the words I never said.\"The former vice-president tells the BBC she is not sure whether it was “grace or recklessness” that stopped her speaking up.The man is a US citizen and a Trump supporter, the president said, but declined to identify him.Saying that airing the advert was a hostile act, Trump announces an additional 10% on top of his existing levies.Liam McCay started making music from his bedroom in County Donegal.Here's what you should know as the US president arrives for a whirlwind week of diplomacy.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Kevin Federline says she needs help","level":"info","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620z3gkrnvo","message":""},{"details":"Summer McKesson struggled to breathe for years. Doctors told her it was because her blood would not stop clotting – and they couldn’t figure out why.A single clot alone can be lethal; but the recurring and unexplained clots that formed in McKesson’s heart and lungs were a medical mystery.After multiple surgeries to remove clots and scar tissue, McKesson traveled to the Mayo Clinic, where she sat in a conference room while renowned physicians and specialists worked through her case on a whiteboard.But even they were baffled.“To hear that even they had never seen it before,” she told CNN through tears, “I came back (home) just crushed at that point.”Desperate for answers, McKesson said she turned to 23andMe, hoping the DNA analysis service, which claims to offer insights into its clients’ genetic health history, might unlock some clues to her condition.But her quest for answers would unearth a family secret – and a doctor’s decades-old deception that has ensnared multiple families across the country.McKesson never questioned her genetics – or considered 23andMe – until a team of surgeons performed an urgent, open-heart procedure in 2022 to remove clots from her heart and lungs.As she recovered, McKesson said her surgeon dropped another bomb.While operating, he’d noticed the connective tissue that supports her organs was stretchy and unusually fragile.  He told her the complication – coupled with McKesson’s willowy build and Amazonian height – could be a sign of an inherited disorder called Marfan syndrome.His suspicions were correct. A geneticist confirmed McKesson’s diagnosis, and said her clotting disorder was also genetic, which ushered in a host of lifelong health challenges.Her heart would now need to be constantly monitored, and she will eventually need at least one more major heart surgery.But the diagnosis was puzzling for another reason: both of her conditions are genetic and, as far as she knew, no one else in her family had them.McKesson, 43, said she didn’t have a full picture of her family’s health history because her father died when she was a teenager. So, she signed up for 23andMe, submitted a DNA sample, and waited.The results arrived in her inbox in October 2023.“I was just sitting on my couch after work, and kind of quickly pulled up the results on my phone,” McKesson recalled. At first, she said, she was curious to learn more about her family’s ethnic background.“Growing up, I always was like … ‘I don’t look like any of y’all. No one has my nose. I’m a foot taller than everyone,’” she said, adding her family used to joke that she was adopted.While there weren’t many surprises in her family’s ancestry, McKesson said when she navigated to the “family members” section of the site, she drew up short:The test showed she had seven half-siblings.“I just remember being shocked and my mind just swirling,” she said. “I’m like, how is this possible? … Did my dad have another family or something?”Was she actually adopted? None of what she was learning made sense.She sent screenshots of the results to a trusted group of friends, and they discussed different theories. Then, later that night, she sent a message to her newly discovered half-siblings through the 23andMe website.“Humor has really gotten me through a lot of this,” McKesson said, so she opted for a lighter tone in her first note.She sent the same message to each name listed on the site. And then, she waited. It would take more than a month for anyone to respond.“I don’t want to cause any conflict,” one of them finally wrote, “but if you want to dig into this, I’d ask your parents if they went to see Dr. Peete.”In 1980, Laurie Kruppa and her husband, Doug, found themselves waiting for a fertility specialist named Dr. Charles Peete in a sterile exam room at Duke University Hospital.The couple wanted children, Laurie told CNN, but Doug had a vasectomy during a previous marriage, so her OB-GYN referred them to the physicians at Duke for fertility treatment.The 1980s and ‘90s would prove to be a time of innovation in the fields of genetics and assisted reproductive technology. In 1978, a woman gave birth to a baby named Louise in the United Kingdom through in vitro fertilization, or IVF, making her the first child to be born through the novel procedure.But the Kruppas opted to use intrauterine insemination, or IUI, a procedure that had been around in some form for centuries but had only recently become common thanks to advances in freezing and banking sperm.During the procedure, a doctor places donor sperm directly into the patient’s uterus during ovulation, to increase the chances of conception.The Kruppas were instructed to bring $50 to each visit and, Laurie stressed, they were told the donor sperm would come from a resident in the university’s medical school.At each visit, Kruppa said she laid back on the table, placed her feet in the stirrups, and waited. And then, Peete would walk into the room.“He seemed nice enough and concerned, but we didn’t have a lot of interaction,” Kruppa recalled decades later.I would “wait 10 or 15 minutes, and then he’d come back and insert the sperm.”Kruppa said it took the couple seven attempts to conceive their eldest daughter. Two visits, less than a year later, to conceive their second daughter. And a single visit in 1984 to conceive their son.And for each child, Peete used his own sperm without her knowledge or consent.It would be decades before the Kruppas would learn the truth about their children’s paternity.During those years, Kruppa said she and her husband had moved their family from North Carolina to Ohio and debated whether they should even tell their kids they were donor-conceived.“We thought maybe the two girls were definitely related because they came 16 months apart. So, we just thought maybe it was a resident that was still there,” Kruppa said.“My son was born two and a half years later, so we thought it had to be somebody different.”After years of keeping their secret, Kruppa said the rising popularity of consumer DNA products eventually forced their hand. They revealed the news to their children during a family vacation.“They all reacted very well,” Kruppa said of her kids. “They’ve never not thought that (Doug) was their dad.”But they also joined 23andMe and began doing their own research. Kruppa said her middle child was the first to discover their connection to Peete. Out of the blue, her daughter asked what hospital her parents used and if Kruppa remembered the name of her doctor.Then, the kids called another family meeting and revealed what Peete had done to their parents. Initially, Kruppa said, “I was really glad they were all true siblings.”It took her months to fully process what Peete’s actions meant for her – and over time, she became angry.“When I started thinking, I got much more upset about the ethics of it,” she said. “I’m pretty sure he was my father’s age … This is like getting raped by your father.”As the Kruppas’ children were grappling with the truth about their paternity, Jim Harris was in North Carolina exchanging emails with a newfound half-sibling on 23andMe.Less than a year after his father died from cancer, Harris said his mom called and insisted they meet to discuss something important.“She drops this bomb that, my dad never wanted to tell me this, but they couldn’t conceive at the time, and they went to a fertility clinic at Duke University.“It was early 1977,” he said, “and they got a sperm donor.”Coming so soon on the heels of his father’s death, Harris said the confession caused him to spiral. He was raised as an only child, but 23andMe revealed he had multiple half-siblings.And Harris said his conversations with one sibling in particular stood out.At first, the woman was confused about their shared genetics, then curious. Maybe she was also donor-conceived, and their parents had used the same donor, she suggested.But when Harris started researching the woman’s maiden name, he discovered her father was Dr. Peete. He sent her a message.To Harris, the conclusion was clear: His mom’s doctor had used his own sperm instead of a donor’s.It took Peete’s daughter days to respond to the revelation, and when she did, she admitted to being “stunned, shocked and completely baffled.”“It didn’t even cross my mind that my dad would’ve been the donor, because my dad was the most honorable human being,” she wrote, “… being a part of whatever or however this happened just doesn’t add up.”But as they continued to exchange messages, she later noted how Jim looked a lot like her father.“I think there is more to this story we may never really know,” she said.Dr. Charles Henry Peete Jr. died in 2013 at the age of 89. CNN reached out to his immediate family multiple times during the reporting of this story, but did not hear back.A public obituary posted online describes Peete as a “compassionate country doctor,” who discovered his passion for medicine by observing his father, the town physician.Peete graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1947 and, according to the obituary, he completed a residency in obstetrics, gynecology and endocrinology before accepting a position as an assistant professor and physician at Duke in 1956.Decades later, in the late 1970s, Peete would become one of Dr. Ken Fortier’s attending physicians and his mentor during his gynecology and gynecological surgery residency at Duke.“He was very calm and composed,” Fortier recalled. “He was superb technically as a surgeon. He made things look easy that others might struggle with.”Peete, he said, was the type of person who was “quietly there in the background, but they’re always there when you need (them).”At the time, Fortier told CNN, it was widely known that residents and medical students – especially those specializing in obstetrics and gynecology – were often tapped to donate sperm.“There wasn’t anything taboo about it,” he said. “There were people in the department who specialized in infertility that tended to have a kind of cadre of donors, and they usually were the best people that were generally healthy.”But when he learned, through CNN, that his mentor and colleague had fathered the children of some of his patients, Fortier searched for the right words.“The idea … the thought of using one’s own sperm … that surprised me,” he said.Among the earliest publicized cases of intrauterine insemination (IUI) in the United States was an act of what’s come to be known as “fertility fraud” – when a physician deliberately misrepresents the origin of donor sperm or eggs, oftentimes using his own sample instead to impregnate a patient.In 1909, a physician in Minnesota wrote a letter to the editor of a medical publication describing an “artificial impregnation” he said he’d witnessed 25 years earlier – in 1884 – while attending medical school in Philadelphia.“At the time the procedure was so novel, so peculiar in its human ethics, that the six young men of the senior class who (witnessed) the operation were pledged to absolute secrecy,” author A.D. Hard wrote.A wealthy couple had visited the hospital to learn why they were struggling to conceive. Hard said the husband was deemed sterile and one of the medical students joked that the only way his wife could get pregnant was with “a hired man.”“The woman was chloroformed and with a hard rubber syringe some fresh semen from the best-looking member of the class was deposited in the uterus, and the cervix slightly plugged with gauze,” Hard wrote.A DNA test turned her life upside down. She’s not aloneThe professor, he said, later confessed his actions to the woman’s husband.“Strange as it may seem, the man was delighted with the idea,” Hard wrote.Both the doctor and the professor agreed to never tell the man’s wife, he said.Today, these actions – and those of Dr. Peete – would be deemed not only unethical, but an act of medical malpractice.Informed consent – or the idea patients have the right to make independent and informed decisions about their own bodies and healthcare outcomes – is a cornerstone of modern medicine.In using his own sperm without his patients’ knowledge, experts told CNN, Peete violated that central covenant.“If he said, ‘we’re using a resident’s sperm,’ and it was his own sperm, that’s very problematic,” said Dr. Robert Klitzman, director of Columbia University’s Masters of Bioethics program and author of the book “Designing Babies.”“The standard (of care) should be to tell people where the sperm is coming from,” he said, “Even back then.”But Peete is far from the only doctor to have committed this type of deception. In 1992, Cecil Jacobson was convicted of 52 counts of fraud and perjury for inseminating his patients with his own sperm and was sent to prison. And the advent of consumer DNA products has led to numerous claims of fertility fraud over the years.For all its focus on creating life, the US fertility industry remains underregulated, Klitzman said. While many countries have pushed to limit or outright prohibit anonymous sperm donations, Klitzman noted the US does not have similar laws.“There are many things that we look at now with an ethical understanding of the full harms, risks, benefits … and think – what were they thinking back then?” Klitzman said.That question haunts Peete’s progeny. Did he use his own sperm because there was a shortage? Or was this ego? Some kind of God complex that drove him to essentially commit medical fraud?For McKesson, the rationale for Peete’s actions is secondary to their repercussions. Learning the truth of her paternity has sparked something of an existential crisis, she said.“Ultimately, the hardest thing to process once you started putting the pieces together was that I was a product of a crime, that I was the product of medical rape,” she said.Both McKesson’s clotting disorder and Marfan syndrome are genetic, meaning one of her biological parents either passed on the traits, or it’s what scientists describe as a “new mutation.”Our DNA consists of billions of letters that combine to form a unique word: You. But sometimes, as the genetic code from each parent divides and replicates, changes are made. Scientists call these mutations.“Most mutations have no meaning,” Klitzman said, “but occasionally one does and that’s the so-called ‘de novo,’ – a new mutation.”These mutations can be spontaneous, but the paternal age of a sperm donor can also be a factor. A study published earlier this month in Nature revealed genetic risks for children increase as fathers age.Peete would have been approaching 60 at the time McKesson was conceived.When she learned Peete was her biological father, McKesson said she reached out to his family for more information on his health but did not hear back.“I’ve never blamed his family for anything, I mean, they didn’t ask for any of this either,” McKesson said.” But “let’s just say (Marfan syndrome) doesn’t run in his family – it could also come from the fact that he was older.”Without further insights into her paternal health history, McKesson admitted she doesn’t have a way to be sure.“I’ve just had to accept that this chapter is never going to be closed,” she said. “It’s just forever changed my life.”Still, McKesson said, because genetic impacts can span generations, she’s been vocal about her conditions with her half-siblings, encouraging anyone she meets to get themselves – and their children – tested.At McKesson’s insistence, Harris, who is 6’7”, was also tested for Marfan syndrome, but he was negative.Thus far, McKesson said Peete is believed to have fathered at least 12 children outside of his immediate family over more than 20 years.But, she added, that number is solely based on those who have submitted DNA samples to consumer DNA sites like 23andMe and Ancestry.And with 23andMe filing for bankruptcy earlier this year, her chances of finding any additional siblings may be dwindling.Since learning the truth of what happened, both Kruppa and McKesson said they have separately been in contact with Duke University, where Peete was employed.In emails reviewed by CNN, the university appeared initially to be responsive. A lawyer was hired to contact Peete’s previous clients and investigate his actions, and, at Kruppa’s instigation, the university now also offers an ethics course that addresses fertility fraud.For a time, McKesson said, the university also appeared to be mediating conversations between Peete’s victims and his immediate family.But when she continued to insist the Peete family provide more insight into the doctor’s genetic and medical history, they stopped responding.When reached for comment on this story, Duke Health officials said in a statement its program is built on a “commitment to operating within the highest ethical and legal standards in the field.”“We have been made aware of unacceptable actions by an individual that occurred in our program in the early days of fertility care during the late 1970s and early 1980s,” the statement said. “The unacceptable actions could not happen today at Duke Health and should never have happened.”CNN also reached out to the legal team that investigated Peete’s actions but did not receive a response.In the US, 14 states have passed laws against so-called fertility fraud. North Carolina, where Dr. Peete was employed, does not yet have a statute against it.Both McKesson and Kruppa said they have separately considered lawsuits. But, given the lack of regulation over the US fertility industry, and the fact that Peete has died, they feel their options are limited.McKesson said it’s “pretty impossible for the victims to have any sort of justice in this situation.”Still, she told CNN, she was most disappointed by how both the Peete family and Duke University have responded to the situation – especially considering that, at least in her case, it could be a matter of life and death.“I felt like this was a chance for them to step up and be involved in doing the right thing, and they’ve chosen not to,” she said.“The patients that were impacted and their families deserve to know that they may have had a crime committed against them and be acknowledged – and to know their family medical history to the extent that that’s possible.”For a while, McKesson said, she would research her newfound siblings to see what traits they have in common. She has the same smile as one of Peete’s daughters, she said. And both McKesson and Harris are slim and tall.But she said she’s decided to speak out now because she’s concerned other siblings might also unknowingly be living with a life-threatening genetic disorder.With treatment, a person diagnosed with Marfan syndrome can expect to live as long as someone without the disease.But left untreated, the average life expectancy is 45 years.“My hope in sharing my story is that if I have any other half-siblings out there, that I could save their life by knowing my medical history,” she said.“I’m trying to do the right thing.”CNN’s Ryan Young and Meridith Edwards contributed to this report.Summer McKesson is employed by a division of Warner Brothers Discovery, the parent company of CNN.© 2025 Cable News Network.

That's why I just talk to the camera and post.\"In only a few years, Sarel's unfiltered style has turned her from an ordinary voice online into one of TikTok's most distinctive personalities, with more than one million followers on the platform.Famous for her Love Island debriefs, Sarel is among the nominees at the second annual TikTok awards - a celebration of the creators shaping online culture in the UK.There are 72 nominees across 12 categories including education, beauty, comedy, food and sport. The nominees have a combined following of more than 83 million followers.From breakout comedians to beauty innovators, this year's nominees include jacket potato entrepreneurs, tap dancing brothers, a bus loving aunty, a BookTok aficionado and a film location fangirl.Sarel can't quite believe that the thing she does most naturally - talking - has gained her millions of followers and likes.\"It's mad people want to watch me yap,\" she says. But the simplicity of her process is part of the appeal and \"you really do see 100% of me on the camera\".Her journey has also taken her beyond the screen, and in 2023 she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with fellow TikTok stars.\"I've got a whole new respect for comedians after doing that,\" she says. \"With content, if people don't like it, they scroll away, but if you bomb on stage, the whole room is looking at you like, 'That's terrible'\".With visibility comes scrutiny, and Sarel says it's not always easy dealing with the darker side of social media.\"The hate is always louder than the love,\" she says. \"Five years ago, I'd clap back in the comments, but I'm 31 now and I'm too tired for that so I just block it out and ignore it.\"Because she started sharing later in life, Sarel is still figuring out how much of herself to put online.\"I go off how I feel in the moment, and my audience respects that,\" she says. \"I started off like I was just talking to friends, but now I protect parts of my life I don't want everyone's opinion on.\"While social media is full of people turning major life events into months-long content strategies, Sarel isn't interested in that and even significant milestones tend to pass with little fanfare on her feed.\"I recently got married and I did two videos, then I was like, 'Let's talk about The Traitors.' I've got ADHD, so I move on quickly.\"Best known for his \"husky posh girl\" sketches, Henry Rowley has become one of TikTok's sharpest comedy voices.The Leicester-born performer discovered his now signature characters while studying at Bristol University, where he found himself \"surrounded by a whole new world of posh\" and he couldn't resist turning it into material.\"Some of those posh people were my friends and I found everything they said hilarious, so I started making videos about things they'd say on nights out.\"His sketches, which more recently include impressions of Harry Potter characters as if they were Scottish, has earned him more than a million followers on TikTok.He's also tried to carve a space in stand-up - a move he admits has been challenging.\"It's entirely different doing content and comedy on stage,\" he says. \"Stand-up takes a lot of work and before the Fringe and my tour, there were so many pubs and awful gigs where I did a 20-minute set to zero laughs. It's certainly humbling.\"Despite his rising profile, Rowley protects much of his life from the public eye.\"I mainly post characters and sketches so people who follow me don't know that much about me, which is really nice. I like having that balance,\" he says.His advice for other people starting out creating content is similar to what most of the nominees said: \"Don't try and go viral but instead focus on doing something you are genuinely interested in.\"If London has an unofficial ambassador for its buses, it might just be Bus Aunty.Often seen smiling beside a passing double-decker, she's turned her lifelong love of the capital's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.\"My love for buses comes from a long time ago, from the early 90s,\" she says. \"I have always taken a picture of myself with buses and one random day I chose to post one on TikTok and it went viral, and now here we are.\"One of her videos, which is nominated for best video of the year, has been viewed amost 50 million times and Bemi now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea.The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admits \"it's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me\".\"I get recognised in the streets sometimes and people say, 'Oh, hello, Bus Aunty.' I never thought people would be stopping me in my wildest dreams and it's taken some getting used to.\"\"To be nominated is amazing,\" she says of her TikTok Awards nod.\"If I'm nominated, it means I deserve to be here, and I really do love buses and love London and hopefully that shows.\"She's also proud to represent a different side of the app's community.\"You're never too old,\" she says firmly. \"I would never have thought I could do TikTok and be nominated for awards, but here I am, having only posted for just over a year.\"Never give up on your dream because what I love about London has got me here.\"If TikTok has a resident librarian, it's Jack Edwards, who has built a devoted following by sharing his love of reading. But he says his journey into social media stardom began with rejection.\"It was lockdown and I was looking for a job in publishing and no-one wanted to hire me,\" he recalls. \"My inbox was snorkelling in a sea of rejection and every email started with the word unfortunately.\"So I started talking about the books I was reading on social media.\"What began as a side project quickly turned into a full-time career, and Edwards ended up leaving the job he'd eventually secured in publishing.He says his advice to would-be creators is finding what makes their content personal.\"You have so many interests,\" he explains. \"If you were to create a Venn diagram of them all, the crossover in the middle is what you should make content about. For me, the cross-section is books, travel and pop culture.\"Edwards adds that he's careful about how much of himself he reveals to his audience. \"I talk about the books and art I love, but never the people I love,\" he says.\"But of course when you talk about books, you end up talking about everything from trauma, to politics, to sexuality.\"That openness has seen him create a community that stretches far beyond the screen.\"People say, 'Hi' in the street and it's the best thing ever. We have a mini book club right there on the pavement, an instant Jane Austen love-fest, and I know it's so strange but honestly it's really special for me.\"Still, internet fame brings its odd moments.\"Sometimes you get a message saying, 'Oh, hi, I just saw you at the urinal,'\" he laughs. \"Being spotted in those kinds of places never gets normal.\"Copyright 2025 BBC.

Husain, one of 20th-century India’s most important artists, this year has been a tale of two auctions.In March, one of the late painter’s monumental depictions of rural life, the 14-foot-long “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” became the most expensive modern Indian artwork ever to go under the hammer. The $13.75 million price tag almost doubled the previous record, with onlookers at Christie’s in New York bursting into spontaneous applause.Three months later, an auction of 25 long-lost Husain paintings in Mumbai was far less celebratory. Police patrolled the premises and erected barricades at the auctioneer’s office after a right-wing Hindu nationalist group warned of “strong public agitation” if calls to cancel the sale — due to Husain’s “vulgar and obscene” portrayals of sacred figures — were ignored.The auction went ahead without incident. But the contrasting moods exemplified the painter’s status as one of Indian art’s most celebrated but controversial names. As if to further underscore his polarized reputation, this year also saw a Delhi court order the seizure of two “offensive” Husain paintings, while, earlier this month, the Qatar Foundation announced plans for an entire museum dedicated to his work (Qatar had given Husain citizenship after he fled India, in 2006, fearing for his safety).Known for bold, colorful explorations of folk and pop culture, Husain was lauded as a pioneer of Indian modernism and often dubbed “India’s Picasso.” His paintings played with icons in all their forms, from Mother Teresa and Indira Gandhi to Bollywood stars and mythological figures from literary epics.The artist’s portrayals of nude Hindu deities, however, stand accused of offending religious sentiments — a reaction his supporters believe is exacerbated by his Muslim heritage. As a result, his later life was dogged by protests, legal action, death threats and an arrest warrant. Despite later being exonerated by India’s supreme court, he died in self-imposed exile, in London, in 2011. In its statement opposing June’s Mumbai auction, right-wing group Hindu Janajagruti Samiti said that Husain “deliberately painted vulgar and obscene images of goddesses … thereby gravely hurting the sentiments of millions of Hindus in the world.”The rekindling of old grievances, almost 15 years after his death, may be down to burgeoning interest from the global art market. But reactions to Husain’s work are also a bellwether of Hindu nationalism, according to Dr. Diva Gujral, an art history fellow at the University of Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art. While many of his most contentious works were produced in the 1970s, it is no coincidence that protests only erupted in 1990s, a decade when the Hindutva ideology flourished, communal tensions deepened and, Gujral said, Muslims became “a lightning rod” in India.“The reception of Husain is such a good litmus test for Indian cultural politics, because there are times when it wasn’t controversial,” she added, calling the reactions a “way to take the temperature of the country.”Hailing from an Indian branch of the Sulaymani Bohras, a Muslim sect residing primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, Husain was exposed to both Hindu and Islamic art from a young age.He was born in 1915 in Pandharpur, a pilgrimage town dotted with Hindu temples in western India. After his mother’s death, he was sent to study Urdu and Islamic calligraphy at his grandfather’s madrassa in Sidhpur, Gujarat. Husain later lived in the city of Indore and immersed himself in folk traditions, like performances of the Hindu epic “Ramayana,” before enrolling in art lessons at the local art institute. In 1934, he sold his first painting on a roadside for 10 rupees.His interest in iconography always stretched far beyond religion. In his early 20s, Husain moved to Mumbai to paint billboards for the nascent Hindi film industry. It would prove a formative experience — one that shaped his fascination with contemporary idols and Bollywood, as well as his penchant for vivid colors and flattened, figurative forms.Then, in 1947, came another decisive moment in the artist’s life: India’s independence from colonial rule and Britain’s partition of the subcontinent into a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Partly inspired by the religious strife that ensued, the painter co-founded the Bombay Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), alongside major figures like F.N. Souza and S.H. Raza, later that year.The avant-garde group sought to forge a new visual language of — and for — India. Rejecting revivalist nationalism, its members fused local art traditions with outside influences, especially those of European modernists like Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse (though Husain also traveled to China in the early 1950s), as they interrogated their country’s emerging identity.“It was about creating something new, breaking with the past,” said Gujral adding that the group did more than “simply take” from Western art. “They’re reinvigorating a language that’s made available to them through access to places like London and Paris. But it’s very much their own thing.”For Husain, this meant a Cubist-inspired style rooted firmly in the Indian experience. It is an approach epitomized by the record-breaking “Untitled (Gram Yatra),” which he produced in 1954, though it went largely unseen for seven decades before going on sale at Christie’s this year. The narrative painting comprises 13 vibrant vignettes, each containing a snippet of rural life. Abstracted villagers are depicted working the land, milling grain and tending to livestock. Elsewhere, a farmer symbolically reaches out of his portrait’s frame to hold up a landscape in a neighboring vignette.“It’s literally the farmer supporting the land, and supporting the state and the nation,” said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian modern and contemporary art at Christie’s. “This is Husain’s way of saying that, while we may be modernizing, post-independence, and entering this new era, it’s very important not to forget that the basis of the country is its rural folk.”Despite the public attention Husain’s later work attracted, his most valuable paintings emerged during this early period, Avari said. “He’s playing this critical role of defining what it is to be an Indian artist in the new country of India, and what Indian modern art really means,” he added. “He’s a linchpin figure in defining this moment.”As many of Husain’s contemporaries moved overseas (including Souza and Raza, who relocated to the UK and France, respectively), the painter remained in India, his eternal muse. He nonetheless enjoyed some global recognition, exhibiting in New York City in 1964 and participating in the 1971 São Paulo Biennial in Brazil alongside Picasso. This period also saw Husain exploring female forms, including images of Hindu goddesses like Durga and Lakshmi, sometimes in suggestive or erotic poses.Husain maintained that he never intended to degrade these deities. His subjects were not the goddesses themselves, but their iconography — how they appeared in temple art, sculptures and friezes. Their nudity was drawn from Indian art history, not his imagination, though the paintings were nonetheless viewed by some critics as a “kind of desacralizing act,” said the University of Oxford’s Gujral.“In Hindu nationalist politics, the bogeyman is the Muslim invader who outrages the modesty of the Hindu woman,” she said. “For a lot of your average Indian viewers who didn’t have an enduring understanding of the nude and its art historical heritage… he becomes the Muslim disrobing the Hindu woman.”“It reignited old ideas of the Muslim taking what isn’t his,” she added. “But the idea for Husain is that this heritage belongs to all of us.”The entire 1980s passed before the paintings faced significant religious backlash. In that time, Husain was even welcomed into the political establishment as a member of the Indian parliament’s upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where he served until 1992.But everything changed in the fall of 1996, when a Hindu monthly magazine, Vichar Mimansa, published the artist’s nude depiction of the goddess Saraswati alongside an article headlined “M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher.” The incident led to multiple criminal complaints against Husain, who was then aged in his early 80s, beginning a chain of events that led to his self-imposed exile.In 1998, Hindu fundamentalists attacked Husain’s Mumbai home and galleries displaying his work. Eight years later, another hardline group offered a 510-million-rupee (then $11.5 million) cash reward for his murder. The protests stretched beyond India’s borders, too, with London’s Asia House controversially canceling an exhibition of Husain’s work in 2006, citing security concerns, after Hindu groups demanded its closure and vandals defaced two of his paintings.That year, a court in Indore issued an arrest warrant for Husain. The offending image, this time, was a more recent painting that reimagined the map of India as a naked woman on her knees, city names marking her body. The artist publicly apologized for causing offense and denied giving it the name “Bharat Mata” — or Mother India, a personification of the nation — claiming the work was untitled. This did little to appease his critics.Concerned for his safety and facing hundreds — or as he later suggested, thousands — of legal cases, Husain left India in 2006. The Delhi High Court and, later, India’s Supreme Court eventually rejected calls for Husain’s summons and cleared him of obscenity charges, effectively quashing cases in other cities. In its ruling, in 2008, the Supreme Court criticized the emergence of a “new puritanism” in India, stating that erotic sculptures were a common sight in Hindu temples. Yet, Husain never felt it was safe to return to the country again.His plight meanwhile became a rallying cry for supporters of Indian secularism. Novelist Salman Rushdie was among those to criticize the Indian government for its “inadequate” protection of Husain and the freedom of expression he represented. “Violence and its ugly sisters, both Hindu and Islamic, have to be resisted,” Rushdie said at an address in Delhi in 2010. “They must be rebuffed. To appease it is the best way to ensure their growth. I am afraid India is going that way.”Husain spent most of his final years in Dubai, Doha and London. Upon surrendering his Indian passport to apply for Qatari citizenship, he is reported to have said: “India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country. What I have surrendered is just a piece of paper.”He also often spoke of his desire to return home — including to his friend Abhishek Poddar, a prominent collector and founder of Bangalore’s Museum of Art & Photography, who regularly mailed Husain his favorite Indore newspaper. “His love was India, and he always missed India,” said Poddar. “I once said, ‘What is it that you miss? And he said, ‘What I really miss is the earth there. The mud.’”Husain’s goddess paintings were just a fraction of his life’s work. Even the most conservative estimates put his total output at 30,000 to 40,000 artworks, spanning printmaking, writing and filmmaking of both the arthouse and Bollywood variety. He was similarly prolific after leaving India: In 2007, he completed 51 paintings inspired by the Bollywood classic “Mughal-e-Azam,” and was, at the time of his death, working on a series of 99 artworks, reflecting the 99 names of Allah, telling the history of Arab civilization.“He needed to paint all the time,” said Poddar, who first met Husain as the artist waited for a lift, without shoes, at a Kolkata bus stop in the early 1980s. (The 57-year-old collector, then a teenage art enthusiast, approached Husain after recognizing his flowing white beard from a weekly magazine, and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship.) “I once saw him at his London property where he had between 25 and 30 works. I met him again two or three days later, and lo and behold, there were another 12 or 13.”“There would have been at least a dozen occasions when he’s sitting with me and he’s drawing somebody’s portrait,” added Poddar, who holds several Husain works in his museum’s collection.Husain painted anywhere and everywhere. Renowned as a showman, he even painted during live performances and immediately auctioned off the resulting works. Taking commissions from Gulf royals and industrialist billionaires, he was something of an art-world celebrity, his distinctive appearance, designer suits and reputation for walking around shoeless all part of his own icon-building.“He was known as the barefoot artist,” said Avari, the Christie’s specialist. “He made that a thing. He would walk around with this very long paint brush, using it as a cane. There was no mistaking the figure of Husain wherever he went.“I don’t know anybody who doesn’t have a Husain story,” he added.But if Husain was, to use Poddar’s words, a “brilliant marketing man,” is it plausible that he had attempted to exploit religious outrage to serve his own ends? Gujral described the painter as a “contrarian” who “definitely liked controversy,” though she suggests he would neither have intended nor anticipated the reaction his work provoked. “He was interested in mass images,” she explained.Poddar meanwhile argued that his fiercely secular friend treated Hindu icons the same as all his other subjects. In fact, Husain was also accused of blasphemy by Islamic groups over a song in his 2004 movie “Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities,” as its lyrics used words directly from the Quran.“If there were a pantheon of figures associated with Islam, I don’t think he would have looked at that any differently from the way he looked at Christianity, Sikhism, Hinduism or whatever else,” said Poddar.“I don’t think he ever had an anti-Hindu agenda,” he added. “Ever.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

That’s about 20% less personnel than the Nimitz class, which the Navy says is possible because of more efficient systems on the Ford.Those efficiencies are what make the Ford the most advanced carrier in the world and result from its two nuclear reactors, whose exact specs are classified but that put out three times the electrical power of those on the Nimitz-class ships, according to the Navy.That extra power enables the Ford to operate the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). Using magnets instead of steam to power the ship’s catapults gives the Ford the ability to launch aircraft faster and with heavier weapons and more fuel, increasing the range and lethality of its fighter jets.The same science applies to its 11 Advanced Weapons Elevators, which use electromagnetic motors rather than hydraulics, meaning it can move munitions more quickly from magazines to the flight deck and loaded onto aircraft.The ship also boasts the Navy’s Advanced Arresting Gear, the system which essentially grabs the tailhook of aircraft with wires when they touch down on its flight deck. The Navy says the digitally controlled system allows for increased sortie rates and lower energy consumption.The Ford’s flight deck is about four feet wider than the Nimitz class, and its “island” – the portion of the ship rising above the flight deck – is smaller and set farther back, giving more space for easier handling of aircraft movements.The sharp teeth of the Ford are the F/A-18 fighter jets in carries.The twin-engine Boeing aircraft can carry a range of air-to-air, air-to-ground and anti-ship missiles as well as laser-guided bombs. They have a maximum combat range of 1,250 miles (2,011 kilometers), according to the Navy.The Ford also carries electronic-jamming aircraft, airborne early warning and control planes, cargo and passenger planes and helicopters.But the Ford doesn’t carry the Navy’s newest stealth fighter jet, the F-35C. Modifications needed to support the fifth-generation aircraft are not expected to be made until a yet-to-be-determined future maintenance period.Getting the Ford into fighting shape was a struggle for the Navy.

In June, she shared that she would be stepping away from the stage. Copeland performed for the last time at the 85th anniversary of the American Ballet Theatre on 22 October.\"Last night was a moment I'll carry with me forever. After 25 years with American Ballet Theatre, I took my final bow surrounded by the company and community that have shaped my life and career,\" she shared on Instagram on 23 October. \"I'm deeply honored to continue my connection to ABT as a member of the Board of Trustees – supporting the next generation of dancers and storytellers who will lead this art form forward. And possibly most special of all, this was the first time my son, Jackson, saw me dance on stage.\"The story below was originally published on 4 January 2024.As Misty Copeland sits onstage at New York City's famed Lincoln Center, she says she hasn't danced under the lights in years – and she's not sure when she will again.In a candid conversation with Katty Kay for her interview series Influential, in which icons including Hugh Bonneville and Ina Garten have opened up to the BBC's special correspondent, Copeland reflects on an iconic career. Aged 41, she has already danced professionally for 27 years – now, she's ready to talk about what comes next.Misty Copeland's final bowOn 22 October, American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Misty Copeland returned to the stage one last time after a five-year hiatus.Among the guests in the audience was Oprah Winfrey, who spoke to NPR about Copeland's impact: \"Misty didn't just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"While Copeland has hung up her shoes for the moment, she told the Associated Press after her announcement that she hasn't ruled out a return: \"You know, I've become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying 'thank you' to the company. So, it's a farewell. (But) it won't be the end of me dancing… Never say never.\"Named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2015, the same year she made history as the first black woman promoted to principal dancer at the prestigious American Ballet Theatre, Copeland says she's entering a new era.\"Is it hard to think that one day you won't be dancing the way you have been?\" asks Kay. \"Not at all,\" replies Copeland, equally directly. \"I already feel like I'm kind of in this place where it feels really natural. I haven't been on stage in about three years. I know I'll be back on the stage at some point. And that may look very different from what it's been throughout my professional career.\"From on stage to on the page, Copeland has danced in hundreds of shows around the world; written children's books and an autobiography; launched two athletic clothing lines; founded a charitable organisation; and last year, became a mother to her son, Jackson, with her husband, attorney Olu Evans. (She has her own Barbie doll, too.)\"I have so many things in my life that kind of fulfil what ballet has been, and ballet is still in that: it's [also] the work I'm doing through my foundation, it's these incredible projects I'm creating with my production company, it's having a son. To me, this feels like a really natural evolution, that I'm just going with the flow,\" says Copeland. Calm and resolute, she adds, \"I'm so content and I'm so proud of the career that I've had.One day, she may perform again, but listening to her body and slipping off the pointe shoes, for now, \"just feels right\".Copeland speaks with brutal honesty about the pain she's experienced since her earliest days performing. Ballet dancers are often pinned with an \"expiration date\", based on their ages and bodies. Yet these aren't the only factors pushing women out of the sport; it's also the gruelling nature of dance itself, which certainly hasn't spared Copeland. At 19, she suffered a lumbar stress fracture, taking her out of the spotlight for about a year; since then, she has undergone several surgeries and subsequent painful healing journeys.Kay asks Copeland how her body, and her relationship to it, has evolved after having a child and entering her 40s. The dancer's answer reveals the truth about her experience in the sport: \"It's interesting – it's more about the injuries that I've had and kind of dealing with that. I feel good having had a baby, I'm in the gym, I'm doing Pilates,\" she says, explaining that the cycle of constantly incurring then recovering from injuries is what's been toughest.\"I recently had another operation to relieve some of the pressure and it didn't do anything, so that's really the biggest battle that I'm facing, not so much my age. We're ever evolving as artists, as people, as women. You kind of have to just move and adjust with that, but when you're dealing with pain, that's a whole other story.\"As for living in a body that's different than \"Misty at 20\", as Kay puts it, Copeland is accepting the change. \"You know that you're never going to go back to that person. Your body's never going to be – you have to just continue to let it grow and change.\"Thinking back to the early months of the pandemic, Copeland shares her perspective shifted on how much suffering one body should take. \"[It was] right before I had a back injury, and I think I had just been really overworked. It had been 20 years of working non-stop. I think about vacations where I was still taking ballet class every day; I had my pointe shoes. No matter where I was in the world, my poor husband would find a studio or a gym and we'd drive an hour. That's been my life.\"Reviewing Copeland's life in pictures, Kay pulls an image of her on stage in the premiere of Firebird, the 2012 Alexei Ratmansky-choreographed ballet in which Copeland danced the titular role, at Lincoln Center, where the two now sit. The production is also the name of a children's book she created to tell the story of a young girl finding her confidence.\"There's so many mixed feelings around this image, because you don't typically see that many black people going into Lincoln Center. So, for what it represents, there's so many happy memories,\" says Copeland. Yet bitter recollection also tempers the sweet side: \"I also had six stress fractures in my tibia [from that performance], and pulled out of the season the next day.\"As she details the pain-laced memories on her way to becoming a principal dancer, Copeland's strength and determination shine through. Resilience is another core theme in Copeland's story. Kay asks her to reflect on a difficult childhood, and asks if she sought bodily autonomy via the strictures of ballet. \"I think it was more than the control over my body,\" she says. \"I think it was control over the situation. It was control over my life in some way. It was consistency. It was stability. It was an escape – a beautiful, artistic-expression escape.\"Now, Copeland is finding the escape of expression in other ways — ones that don't put her body on the line quite so much.In 2022, Copeland founded the Misty Copeland Foundation, a non-profit organisation to bring \"greater diversity, equity, and inclusion to dance, especially ballet\". The after-school programme offers affordable dance classes, mentorship services, music lessons and health and wellness-related programs to children in underserved areas of the US. In early 2023, Copeland also released Flower, a short film in which she stars that uses dance to explore \"intergenerational equity\". Flower is the first project from Copeland's Life in Motion Productions, the company she founded with fellow former American Ballet Theater dancer, Leyla Fayyaz.Throughout the years, interviewers and fans alike have frequently asked Copeland about her experiences being one of few professional ballet dancers of colour – and this work is where she prefers to take the conversation. \"There are so many things that I think about in terms of disrupting the field and provoking the conversation to be really intentional about the lack of diversity,\" she says.When pushed to reflect on the body-judgment she faced as a ballet dancer who looked \"different\" from others in her company, Copeland puts the criticism into context. \"I was told I was too muscular, I was too short, my breasts are too big. And to me, that's all code for your skin is too dark, your skin is too brown.\"But she believes it is possible for ballet to be more inclusive. \"It's not about what the package is it's how you make people feel; it's how you deliver the performance, the character, and that can be done in a variety of ways\", she says, adding the works themselves fail to reflect modern society.\"Ballets were created centuries ago and no longer reflect society today; a lot of them are really sexist, really racist, something that we're conscious of more so in America than elsewhere – ballets are still being performed in blackface in Russia.\" In 2019, Copeland criticised the Bolshoi Theatre for its use of blackface in performances. According to CNN, the theatre brushed off the criticism, telling Russian state-run media that it would not change its practices.\"I look at myself and my career is not me,\" Copeland says, when asked why she's influential. \"It's what I represent. It's all of the people that have gotten me to this place that I stand on the shoulders of. I just think of my life and my career as this very holistic thing, it's give and take, and it's not just about me. It's so much bigger than me.\"Kay's conversation with Copeland is the fifth in her revealing, nine-part interview series.

Harris however,  emphasized that she has not made a final decision but continues to view herself as an active player in US politics.Addressing polls that place her behind others for the Democratic ticket, Harris said she pays little attention to such numbers, saying, “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”Harris further argued that her predictions about Trump’s authoritarian tendencies have been proven right: “He said he would weaponize the Department of Justice — and he has done exactly that.”The former vice president went on to cite the short suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after comments about Charlie Kirk’s death. The president celebrated the suspension at the time.“You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponized, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists. His skin is so thin he couldn’t endure criticism from a joke and attempted to shut down an entire media organization in the process.”Harris also criticized American business leaders and institutions she believes have been too quick to yield to Trump’s authority.“There are many, that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation,” she told the BBC.© 2025 Cable News Network.

And he can’t seal a deal with a California winemaker to launch a new product line because the government is not approving new labels for bottles during the funding lapse.“The government is still taking money from us, but it’s not paying out what it owes,” he said, referring to the tax credits.The shutdown has frozen many of the government’s key functions, such as lending and processing tax credits. And now without pay, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country have pulled back on spending, creating economic ripple effects.From restaurants in Washington, DC, to businesses around national parks, the shutdown’s impact is spreading through the US economy, with no relief in sight.Sean Han, chef manager at Market to Market, a cafeteria at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, said foot traffic has declined about 20% to 30% since the government shutdown began — during a year that has already been tough because of mass federal layoffs.The business hasn’t reduced employees’ hours yet, he said, but that could happen — in addition to the possibility of layoffs — if the shutdown drags on for longer. With fewer customers, Han said he directed workers to focus on giving whoever comes in a better dining experience.“We’ve been around for about 20 years, so we’ve seen this before,” Han said. “But it took us nine months to recover after the pandemic and we’ll have to rebuild again once this ends.”Restaurant reservations in Washington were down 9% last week compared to the same week a year earlier, according to data from OpenTable.In North Carolina, Pam Anderson is caring for only a handful of dogs at her Ocean Sands K-9 Resort in Kill Devil Hills.Some of her local clients have been calling off or shortening their vacations because the impasse has affected the national parks, or they are federal employees who are not being paid. At the same time, she is not getting any bookings from tourists, which she suspects is because the popular Wright Brothers National Memorial has shuttered.Just this week, a local family who planned to leave their two dogs with her for a few days in mid-November pulled out, which will cost her $500 in lost revenue. The couple works for the federal government.Although the kennel had a “rocking September,” reservations are down 40% for October and 60% for November so far compared to last year, leading Anderson and her husband to tighten their belts. They have stopped going out to dinner a few times a week and are holding off on their charitable giving.“I told my husband the other day, ‘Don’t spend any money’,” said Anderson, 70, who is thinking of getting a night job.Last March, restauranteur Fran Bolden opened a cafeteria at the Redstone Arsenal, a US Army base near Huntsville, Alabama. It was a profitable side venture for Bolden in a town whose economic lifeline is the military, defense and aerospace industries.But that restaurant, Arsenal Eats, is now shuttered until the government reopens. Bolden said they usually expect around 150 people a day for breakfast and lunch; the past two weeks saw only between 25 to 30.“The volume is just not there,” she said.Businesses all over downtown Huntsville and beyond are feeling the pinch, she said, and small businesses bear a big brunt of the burden.“The local economy is in a military city. With people not out, not spending money, not sure what to do – we rely on the business of these people in order to be able to sustain ourselves,” Bolden said.For the past two years, toddlers at Bernard Jackson’s swim and wellness center in Washington, DC, have learned to float for the first time, and seniors in their eighties have practiced gentle exercises to stay strong.But the shutdown has taken a heavy toll. With fewer families able to afford lessons and operating costs on the rise, Jackson has had to make difficult choices just to keep his doors open. Many of his clients are federal employees directly affected by the lapse in pay.“Since people are not getting paid, they aren’t coming to their lessons,” Jackson told CNN as he was leaving an unemployment center.“I can tell you at least 40% of my revenue has gone down.”Even as attendance drops, Jackson is finding ways to support his clients. He continues to send instructions and exercises for them to practice at home.“The pool is still open,” he said.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

He was living in New York City and working at a nonprofit when the city was devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Stuck in his small Queens apartment, the self-described “news junkie” spent long stretches online, falling into internet wormholes.At some point, he says, he came across the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC).The Church, which is considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, is best known for organizing pickets at soldiers’ funerals and emblazoning anti-LGBT slogans on protest signs and billboards.“The first thing I saw was that (the church) was in a neighborhood. I was walking around and I decided to do a 360 view and I saw a ‘for sale’ sign in front of the house on Google Earth. I thought it would be really funny to buy that house.”Although that specific house in Topeka, Kansas, was no longer for sale when Jackson inquired, another one on the street was. Jackson bought it sight unseen. Despite never having been there, he was ready for a change, so he moved to his new digs in Topeka, the state capital.But becoming the WBC’s neighbor was only the first step in his plan.Next, he painted the house’s exterior in rainbow stripes to make it look like a Pride flag. The act was intentional, agitprop for the social media age. It was a response to the the church’s anti-gay rhetoric, and it was right in front of their living room windows, impossible to ignore.He named it the Equality House.Photos of the home went viral, but Jackson thought people would see a picture, have a laugh, and then move on.Instead, they showed up to visit.Although Topeka has a population of about 125,000 people, its location along I-70, a major highway that cuts east-west across the US, makes it a convenient stop along road trips. The Westboro Baptist Church, and the Equality House, are just off the highway.A few years later, Jackson bought a second home on the street and painted it in pink, white and blue stripes to resemble the trans pride flag.Jackson doesn’t call the Equality House a “spite” house, but he knows that a lot of people disagree. The house is part of a wider nonprofit he’s established called Planting Peace, which has launched other initiatives including orphanages and elephant rescue efforts.“The Equality House is a symbol of compassion, peace, and positive change,” the organization’s website says. But its location, facing the infamous church, makes a case for its “spite” house label.Spite architecture has a short but vivid history, most of it American.It’s sometimes mistakenly linked to “nail” houses, where owners refuse to sell to developers, leaving a single structure marooned amid new constructions. Sometimes owners are holding out for a bigger payday. Others stay put out of stubbornness — think of the little house at the beginning of the movie “Up.”But spite houses are different. They’re built not to resist developers but, as their name suggests, they’re intentionally designed, with a degree of malice, to annoy someone specific.Boston’s “Skinny House” may be the most famous example.Ten feet wide and four stories tall, it rises from the city’s historic North End. According to a real estate agent who once sold it, two brothers owned the plot. One built a grand home for himself while the other was away fighting in the Civil War. When the soldier returned, furious that his brother had left him a smaller portion of the plot, he built a narrow tower to block the mansion’s view and sunlight.Today, a plaque outside the diminutive 44 Hull Street property reads “Skinny House,” with “Spite House” in parentheses. Although it’s still a private residence, it has become a tourist attraction in the tony Boston neighborhood, which also contains the Old North Church, the city’s oldest, and a statue of Paul Revere.On Google Maps, it’s labeled “Boston spite house.” Instagram is full of photos of tourists visiting the house, with “stretching my arms out between this house and the one next door” by far the most popular pose.Spite is one thing. Prime location is another. Despite its dimensions and the regular parade of visitors outside, the home sold for $1.25 million in 2021.The debate: Is hostile architecture designing people – and nature – out of cities?While spite houses aren’t an exclusively American phenomenon, they do flourish in the United States. The mix of private-property culture, individualism, and the country’s fragmented zoning laws creates ideal conditions for personal grudges to solidify into real estate.“Hostile architecture is very American,” says Paavo Monkkonen, assistant professor in the University of California, Los Angeles’ Department of Urban Planning. “Your house represents more here than it does in other countries. It’s a more personal symbol because it’s a home ownership society. There’s more neighbor-to-neighbor conflict.”Spite houses are a kind of hostile architecture, but usually on a local scale —built for the irritation of a particular person or family. Broader “hostile architecture” includes things like uncomfortable park benches meant to keep homeless people from sleeping on them.“The US approach to urban design is often not people-centric,” says Monkkonen. “In the sense that in certain parts of the city you want to build things that no one will go to, plazas that will be empty, because you want to protect your own peace and quiet.”There are spite houses outside of the US, too.Sarajevo’s Inat Kuća, or House of Resentment, offers a Balkan version of the genre.In the 1800s, Austro-Hungarian authorities wanted to demolish homes alongside the Miljacka River to make room for a new city hall. One homeowner refused to sell. The eventual compromise saw the government move his house, brick-by-brick, and rebuild it in the opposite river bank.Today, the structure is home to a traditional Bosnian restaurant, but to locals it will always be the House of Spite or House of Contempt – a moment of David defeating Goliath, and a symbol of Bosnian pride.And it doesn’t have to be a full-on house of spite to get visitors interested in stopping by.In New York City’s West Village, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the United States, a small, easily missed corner of pavement has become an unlikely tourist attraction.This isn’t just any old piece of Manhattan asphalt.The 500-square-inch triangle carries an all-caps message: “PROPERTY OF THE HESS ESTATE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DEDICATED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES.”Officially, it’s called the Hess Triangle. Unofficially, it’s the “spite triangle.”Its existence began as a beef between the Hess family — German immigrants who owned large plots of land in this part of Manhattan — and the city, which seized most of their land in the early 1900s to build the subway.When a survey showed the city’s measurements of the land were slightly off, the family refused to surrender the remaining two-foot sliver. Instead they tiled their protest into the ground.The appearance of the spite triangle made headlines in July 1922, with the New York Times giving it an aptly small amount of newspaper real estate .For Aaron Jackson’s Equality House project, going viral had pros and cons. He was happy that the wave of attention got people to learn about Westboro Baptist Church and educate themselves on LGBT issues.However, it got to the point that he no longer wanted to live in the house day-to-day. Instead, Jackson is converting the home into a museum and library so that people who visit can do more than just take a picture.Some guests, Jackson says, want to show support when they visit the Equality House. Others want to argue. Some consider it a spite house, while others think it’s an activist experiment.“At the end of the day,” says Jackson, “it’s an art project. I don’t tell people how to feel.”© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Melissa could make landfall on Jamaica late Monday or early Tuesday. Haiti also continues to be in thick of Melissa’s destructive flood and landslide threats.A hurricane warning is effect for Jamaica, where strong winds are expected to begin tonight. Southern Haiti is under a hurricane watch.Melissa has been moving at a snail’s pace for days and it won’t pick up speed anytime soon as it tracks generally westward through Sunday night.That slow movement has already caused problems. Torrential rain bands have swamped Haiti and the Dominican Republic for much of the week, causing flooding and triggering landslides. At least three deaths have been reported in Haiti due to the storm, two of which were the result of a landslide, the Haitian Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. In the Dominican Republic, at least one person has died and more than 1,000 people have evacuated or been displaced, officials said Friday.Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify into a Category 4 or stronger hurricane by Sunday afternoon, ramping up its destructive wind and storm surge threats alongside the intense rain as it tracks near or south of Jamaica through early next week. Landfall as a Category 5 hurricane cannot be ruled out and Melissa could be the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in Jamaica.This explosive strengthening is happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Three of the four Atlantic hurricanes this season underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.Jamaica, Haiti and the southern Dominican Republic will face the worst of the storm into at least early next week. Next in line for strong winds, storm surge and flooding rain will be eastern Cuba, the southern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.Rainfall totals up to 30 inches are expected from Melissa in parts of southwest Haiti and Jamaica through Tuesday, with local maxima of 40 inches. Eastern Cuba could receive totals of up to 18 inches.“Extensive damage to roads and buildings is expected, potentially isolating communities for an extended period of time,” in Haiti on Saturday, the hurricane center warned. “This is a life-threatening situation and immediate preparations to protect life and property should be taken.”Jamaica will not only endure Melissa’s torrential rain, but will also have to contend with days of ferocious winds. The nation of nearly 3 million people will likely see hurricane-force winds by Sunday or Monday. The most extreme winds will likely occur as Melissa tracks near Jamaica on Monday into Tuesday. Downed trees, power outages and structural damage could be widespread.Officials in the country are already preparing for the worst. All public hospitals have been in “emergency mode” since Thursday evening, halting outpatient and elective procedures to ensure more beds are open, according to Christopher Tufton, Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness.Jamaica’s airports remain open for now, but Norman Manley International Airport will close after its last scheduled arriving flight at 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) Saturday evening, according to Daryl Vaz, the minister of transport. The closure of Sangster International Airport will be discussed later on Saturday, Vaz said in a press briefing.“There is nowhere that will escape the wrath of this hurricane,” Evan Thompson, the principal director of Jamaica’s Meteorological Service, said Saturday. “It’s going to sit there, pouring water while it’s barely moving and that is a significant challenge… as long as what is predicted does take place.”In a series of updates on X, Holness, the prime minister, warned “peak storm surge heights could reach 7 to 11 feet above ground level” near and to the east of where the storm makes landfall.“Now is the time to secure your home, check your roof, windows, and surroundings. Use sandbags or plywood where needed and clear any overhanging branches safely,” he wrote. “If you live in a flood-prone area, take protective measures and have an evacuation plan ready”Jamaicans who spoke with Reuters on Saturday acknowledged the danger of a slow-moving hurricane, contrasting Melissa’s sluggish pace to Hurricane Beryl.“Slow movement still cause a lot of damage, right?” said fisherman Clive Davis in Kingston. “Different from Beryl cause Beryls come with a speed and never stay too long. Just sweep through. But this now, she wants to come stay, visit Jamaica for 3 days, why?”“It’s gonna slow down business, but it’s nature,” Davis added. “We can’t fight against nature, right?”Into Saturday, workers in Kingston dredged as much trash and silt as they could from the bottom of Sandy Gully, an approximately 20 km long waterway snaking along the city’s western flank. When Melissa brings its months’ worth of rain as it passes over Jamaica, the swollen, debris-filled gully could knock out bridges, splitting Kingston in two.The United States mainland is not expected to be directly threatened by Melissa. Even so, rough surf and rip currents could spread along the US East Coast next week.Hurricane Beryl in July 2024 was the last storm to heavily impact Jamaica. It did not make landfall, but still lashed the island with flooding rain and strong winds as it passed to the south as a Category 4.As this tricky forecast comes into focus, all signs point to Jamaica being ground zero for what could become one of the most destructive hurricanes of the season.CNN Meteorologists Briana Waxman, Mary Gilbert, along with reporters Billy Stockwell and Max Saltman contributed to this report.© 2025 Cable News Network.

New inventions and patents are emerging from countries and cities across the globe, but a few places stand out as driving the greatest progress.The 2025 Global Innovation Index (GII), published annually by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), ranks the top countries and metro-city clusters based on criteria including investment patterns, technological progress, adoption rates and overall socioeconomic impact. Collectively, the 100 leading clusters – from San Francisco to Shenzhen – account for more than 70% of global patents and venture capital activity.We spoke to residents of the top five innovation clusters to discover how technology shapes daily life and how visitors can experience their cutting-edge ideas – often before they reach the rest of the world.China broke into the GII's top 10 for the first time this year, propelled by its surging number of patents, scientific investment and venture capital growth. It now hosts 24 of the 100 leading clusters in the report, with the South China tech centre of Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou coming in at number one.In this region, technology is woven into everyday life and innovation is embedded in the culture. Hong Kong resident Jamie River says you can be at a street market where vendors use QR codes for payments next to handwritten price signs, while small shop owners manage their delivery orders through three different apps. \"The collision of old and new creates this weird energy where nobody's scared to try stuff,\" says River, who has lived here for three years.Hong Kong's Octopus card, which originally launched in 1997 as a payment method for public transport, is now a favourite everyday tech solution that can be used to pay for everything from vending machines to parking meters.To experience Hong Kong's cutting-edge technology, River recommends visitors take the Star Ferry at night and watch the Symphony of Lights show, which synchronises a musical score with lights, lasers and LED screens across 43 buildings. For a glimpse of creative crossover, PMQ (a former police quarters) now houses studios, shops and cafes. \"You'll see 3D-printing workshops next to traditional calligraphy studios,\" he said.Top 10 innovation clusters1. Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou2. Tokyo-Yokohama3. San Jose-San Francisco4. Beijing5. Seoul6. Shanghai-Suzhou7. New York8. London9. Boston-Cambridge10. Los AngelesHome to global corporations from Huawei to Tencent, Shenzen's transformation from fishing village to tech powerhouse was an intentional move by the Chinese government when it designated the city as its first Special Economic Zone in 1980, offering tax breaks and incentives to spur innovation. Its status as a hub for creativity only grew after it was named a Unesco Creative City in 2008, with investment funding makerspaces such as the Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab.\"This supportive framework enables rapid scaling and experimentation,\" said Leon Huang, a resident since 2008. \"Makerspaces such as the OCT Loft and Shekou's Design Society are available to everyone, granting affordable access to advanced tools, including VR setups. The variety of people who frequent these spaces, including hobbyists, students and professionals from tech companies like Huawei and DJI, contributes to a truly inclusive atmosphere.\"Huang suggets visitors catch one of the elaborate drone shows that take place over Shenzhen Talent Park Bay or during major events such as the Spring Festival and National Day. The city recently set the record for the world's largest drone show, employing nearly 12,000 drones.Ranked second, the Tokyo-Yokohama cluster produces the highest percentage of international patent filings in the world, accounting for more than 10% of global filings. What residents appreciate, however, is that the technology and innovation feel practical rather than flashy.\"In Japan, tech isn't some wild imagination of flying cars like what we all imagined 2050 would be,\" said Dana Yao, who met her husband in Tokyo and now splits her time between Japan and the United States. Instead, she says, it's the train card that can be used for buses and vending machines, and the AI sensors at convenience stores that allow self-checkout and cashless pay. \"You'll find these small but mighty innovations everywhere. They're high-tech, but still so human and actually helpful.\"Travellers can experience this tech-forward world at the Henn Na Hotel where check-in is fully automated, some of the staff are robotic and \"smart beds\" adjust the temperature for optimal sleep. Yao also recommends riding the driverless train on the Yurikamome Line in Tokyo Bay. \"It's fully automated and gives you stunning views of the city and Rainbow Bridge,\" she said.For a dose of digital wonder, teamLab Planets offers a tech-immersive art experience. \"Entire rooms react to your movements, light and sound,\" Yao said. \"It's just incredible.\"Known worldwide as Silicon Valley, the San Jose-San Francisco cluster leads the world in venture capital, generating nearly 7% of all global deals. The GII report also found it to have the most concentrated innovation activity per capita.That density is what continues to attract entrepreneurs and start-up founders, especially as the AI opportunity looms large. \"I've never wanted to live in San Francisco until now. It's like the original dot com boom. Very smart people are congregating here and people who left have come back,\" said new San Francisco resident Ritesh Patel, founder of Ticket Fairy.That means networking possibilities are everywhere. \"You could be at a dinner having a conversation about challenges you're facing as a startup founder and the next minute someone at the table says that they can help,\" he said. \"They send a text and suddenly you have an intro or meeting with a relevant person that you could never have reached by email or social media. It's wild!\"For visitors to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, it's all about trying tech before it hits the mainstream. \"You'll discover cutting-edge tech that the rest of the world won't know about for six to 12 months,\" said Patel. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft were widely used here before they became global companies – and now autonomous-driving Waymo cars have significant market share in the area and can be used by anyone who downloads the app.In the GII, China's capital outscored every other city for scientific research output, contributing 4% of all globally published papers. But residents say Beijing’s real strength is its balance between high-tech infrastructure and deep cultural roots.\"Other 'smart cities' really focus on modern edge, but Beijing blends innovation, culture and livability, which makes it feel simultaneously advanced but unique,\" said AI futurist Elle Farrell-Kingsley, who currently calls Beijing her home base. She says daily life is powered by super apps like Alipay and WeChat, which both include translation options, QR code payments and food ordering solutions. She also says AI, particularly Deepseek and DouBao, is built into daily services, which makes translation easier for English speakers.More like this:• Inside Asia's best countries for expats• The secret to life in the world's best cities• Five of the world's safest countries for 2025The only frustrating thing can be leaving home and finding services aren't quite as seamless elsewhere. \"It all functions so well here, it's almost forgettable how integrated and innovative these services can be until leaving,\" she said. \"I rarely see major tech mishaps, and often find myself frustrated or impatient when visiting other countries and not having these services or things not running as smoothly.\"Travellers can experience the city's advanced AI firsthand by booking Baidu's Apollo robotaxi. \"It's incredibly exciting to experience, especially because there’s no steering wheel!\" said Farrell-Kingsley. \"You simply hop in and the car sets off on its own, which feels both futuristic and surprisingly safe.\"Ranked fifth in the GII's innovation clusters, Seoul accouts for 5.4% of global patent applications and leads Asia in VC deals (coming in second overall to San Francisco). Residents say South Korea's drive to innovate comes from necessity, as the small country has a limited amount of natural resources to draw on.\"The country has to compete through innovations and technology,\" said Chris Oberman, who has lived in Seoul since 2024 and writes about his travels at Moving Jack. \"Many people's grandparents lived in poverty, so there is still this huge urge and energy to grow, improve, innovate and not fall behind.\"Much of the innovation and technology is baked into everyday life. Homes typically have doors that unlock with digital codes, and cashless payment systems mean that you only need your phone when heading out. \"Keys, cards, my wallet, cash; I can just leave [them] all at home,\" said Oberman.Visitors can experience the city's futuristic infrastructure along Cheongyecheon Stream, a walkable plaza area with self-driving electric buses that you can hop on and off. Across the city, cashierless convenience stores operate 24/7, allowing customers to take products and pay at smart machines, while AI systems track inventory and prevent theft.--If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.Discover how quirky clips paved the way for viral humour, proving randomness never goes out of style.British mathematician Hannah Fry digs into the science of touchscreens.Why do flying fears persist despite falling accident rates?

There’s no agreement on when it emerged from the water, but official settlement began in the 1970s. Today, it’s home to around 3,000 people. But the land they live on isn’t stable; Santa Rosa’s shape and size shifts with the river’s flow. Each year, sandbanks form and disappear, as the main channel carves new paths.“If God wanted, the river would change and even Santa Rosa could disappear,” said Gladys Hari Leiva, a hotel owner who has lived on the island for 21 years.The island’s mercurial geography makes it a difficult place to settle; families adapt season by season, walking across sandbanks in the dry months, then paddling canoes through flooded streets when the rains come.In recent years, as the Amazon has experienced droughts and unpredictable flood cycles, the patterns of change residents have grown accustomed to are shifting with the sands.Yet despite these limitations, the island is coveted by the countries around it. Peru and Colombia have argued over who the island belongs to for decades. As the Amazon River moves, so too does the international boundary between the two countries.Santa Rosa has never been solid ground. The Amazon Basin builds and erases its own geography through its rivers.The main channel of the Amazon River constantly erodes existing land and deposits new earth. Each year the river carries roughly 1.2 billion tons of sediment from the Andes toward the Atlantic, reshaping its banks and islands as it flows. During high-water months, water spills over and settles across the floodplain, leaving behind up to 12 inches of fresh soil annually.Residents who have lived in the Basin for a long time are used to the seasonal ebb and flow of the water and land, but it’s becoming less predictable.In the past two years, historic droughts have left wide dry patches where deep channels once flowed. According to Brazil’s Geological Service, water levels across the Amazon River fell to record lows in 2023 and 2024, and the widespread impact can still be felt by river communities.For Santa Rosa islanders, drought means adaptation: food prices spike, traveling becomes complicated, and some families temporarily relocate to stay near navigable water.“We are used to the rises and falls,” Leiva said. “But now you never know. The floods come at strange times, and the heat is getting stronger and stronger.”It is possible that droughts and floods can speed up erosion in some areas and build land up faster in others, according to Paulo Olivas, an ecologist and environmental scientist at Florida International University.“That’s what makes the future of places like Santa Rosa so uncertain,” Olivas said.Santa Rosa’s fragility has not stopped Peru and Colombia fighting over it. In fact, its shifting shoreline has made matters worse.The roots of the conflict stretch back to the early 20th century when the two countries sought to define their Amazonian borders.Under the 1922 Salomón–Lozano Treaty, Colombia ceded large tracts of Andean territory to Peru, while gaining the city of Leticia — which sits directly across the river from Santa Rosa — and its crucial access to the Amazon River. The treaty and the 1934 Rio de Janeiro Protocol set the border along the deepest navigable channel of the Amazon, a line meant to be natural and permanent. But the river has never been static.Over time, the shifting course of the Amazon created new islands and reconfigured the boundary, leaving new land, like Santa Rosa, that neither side expected to exist.“The island can appear, disappear, get bigger, get smaller,” said German Vargas-Cuervo, adjunct professor at the National University of Colombia and a specialist in the geology and geomorphology of natural systems. “The river moves and so everything that is inside the river is dynamic.”Former Peruvian President Dina Boluarte visited the island in August. Her trip was covered by the Associated Press, which quoted her as saying, “Peru’s sovereignty is not in dispute; the district of Santa Rosa de Loreto is Peruvian and will remain so.”Peru claims Santa Rosa because many of the island’s inhabitants identify as Peruvian and it is administered by Peruvian agencies. In 2025, the Peruvian government declared it a district, with the stated aim of increasing residents’ access to public services and “consolidating sovereignty.”The country also claims Santa Rosa was previously part of Chinería Island, territory granted to Peru under the 1922 Salomón-Lozano Treaty.Colombia disputes this, contending that Santa Rosa did not exist when the treaty was signed and therefore cannot be claimed under its terms. Colombia also argues that the river boundary has shifted, placing Santa Rosa in its territory. President Gustavo Petro recently criticized Peru on X for “appropriating” the island.Despite its small size, Santa Rosa holds strategic and symbolic weight. It sits at the tri-border crossroads of Peru, Colombia, and Brazil — a key transit point for trade and travel along the Amazon. In recent years, it’s also gained modest fame for its food and tourism scene, drawing visitors to riverside restaurants.Leiva is originally from Yauyos, Peru, and moved to the island for job opportunities in the tourism industry. But despite its economic growth, Santa Rosa lags the countries that claim it.There is little infrastructure, and electricity has only become available around the clock in recent years. Sewage facilities remain largely absent, as is running water, with residents relying on wells. Health care is precarious with little government support.Some residents, like Leiva, consider Santa Rosa to be a paradise where international disputes feel more distant than the power of the river. Markets overflow with mixed currencies; multiple languages echo in the streets. Many locals hold dual or triple identities, carrying Peruvian ID cards alongside those from Colombia and Brazil.“Everything is calm here,” said Leiva. “Every day we exchange cultures, currencies, and jobs.”For now, life continues; children go to school, families open shops, and tourists come for nature and food.But beneath that calm, the river keeps moving and reshaping the sand, grain by grain. The same waters that sustain the island can also erase it, a reminder that life on the Amazon is as shifting as the river itself.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Roosevelt’s presidency.According to The White House Historical Association, Roosevelt enjoyed watching World War II-era news reels in the former cloakroom in the East Terrace at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, “and took special interest in the battles fought in Europe and Asia.”The 32nd US president demonstrated an understanding of the importance of pop culture, including movies.“Entertainment is always a national asset,” Roosevelt said in 1943 as the United States was engaged in WWII. “Invaluable in time of peace, it is indispensable in wartime.”Not that there weren’t movies shown in the White House before that.Well before the installation of the White House Family Theater, then-President Woodrow Wilson screened 1915’s “The Birth of a Nation,” with the film projected onto the walls of the East Room.The East Wing of the White House, and the 123 years of American history it embodied is now reduced to rubble.Later presidents greatly enjoyed showing movies in the theater, and the George W. Bush Library detailed that film screenings would run the gamut from official events with members of the public invited as guests to “private events and intended for the enjoyment of the President, his family, and his close friends and staff.”“The best perk out in the White House is not Air Force One or Camp David or anything else,” said former President Bill Clinton. “It’s the wonderful movie theatre I get here, because people send me these movies all the time.”The 42-seat theater had different looks over the years. Business Insider reported that “it went from green chairs and mustard curtains to white chairs and floral drapes” before donning its most recent “all-red design.”Sometimes referred to as the “first movie theatre,” it hosted a variety of genres of film.In January 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter let it be known that only “family friendly” films should be shown, which was short-lived when, the following Christmas, he unwittingly screened an X-rated picture at the White House – John Schlesinger’s Oscar-winning “Midnight Cowboy,” which tells the story of a male prostitute in the underbelly of 1960s-era in New York City.In 2011, Steven Spielberg talked about screening his hit 1982 film “E.T.” for then-President Ronald Reagan.The famed director said those present were “the President, the First Lady and all of their guests, which included Sandra Day O’Connor in her first week of as a Justice of the Supreme Court, and it included some astronauts… I think Neil Armstrong was there, I’m not 100% certain, but it was an amazing, amazing evening.”“(Reagan) just stood up and he looked around the room, almost like he was doing a headcount, and he said, ‘I wanted to thank you for bringing “E.T.” to the White House. We really enjoyed your movie,’ and then he looked around the room and said, ‘And there are a number of people in this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true,’” Spielberg recalled. “And he said it without smiling!

The executive mansion, with its great state spaces like the East Room and State Dining Room, is elegant, but intimate. The Cross Hall, leading to the front door on the north front of the building, is imposing but not overwhelming. This is where the haunting picture of a pensive John F. Kennedy hangs, and where President Barack Obama walked down a long red carpet to announce the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011. There’s nothing like the scenes in the TV show “The West Wing” with idealistic young staffers doing the walk-and-talk through endless corridors of busy power players. If you tried to do that in the real West Wing, you’d hit a wall and break your nose.Most presidents — unlike Donald Trump, who loaded up the Oval Office with gold trinkets — stick to traditional dignified furnishings. The place is tasteful but discreet. It hums with quiet intensity. But it’s not brawny. The power here is great, and it enhances itself through understatement. There is no need to boast.Most visitors to the White House, for a tour or a Christmas party, would enter through the East Wing, a low-slung annex with a white-columned entrance. Guests traversed a corridor between wood panels, with doors leading off to office complexes for the first lady. Walls that soaked up history kept alive the aura of Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan. This was Eleanor Roosevelt’s domain.That’s all gone now, turned into dust and rubble in a couple of extraordinary days when demolition teams ripped apart the East Wing on the orders of Trump, who is itching to build his $300 million ballroom in its place.There may never have been a better metaphor for a presidency. Trump has spent nine months tearing away at the federal government, the rule of law and democracy. Now he’s turned his wrecking ball on the White House itself. All without consulting the citizens who gave him a temporary lease on the place.Democrats, preservationists and historians slammed Trump as a philistine. His spokespeople counter that many presidents changed the White House. Franklin Roosevelt built the current Oval Office. Harry Truman gutted the entire interior and reconstructed it to stop it from collapsing. But no modern president contemplated Trump’s stark destruction — which followed his paving over of the iconic Rose Garden to emulate the terrace at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida, complete with yellow sun umbrellas.So, what about the ballroom? The grand design seems to get bigger every time Trump pulls out his prints of artist’s impressions. Visiting NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte looked surprised to get a sneak preview of plans for Trump’s new labor of love rather than maps of war-rattled Europe in the Oval Office on Wednesday.Trump now envisages a massive edifice of at least 90,000 square feet — almost twice the size of the White House itself, and daubed with his signature gold leaf — that could accommodate huge events and parties. Trump has rightly complained the White House lacks a large venue. He even offered to build one for the Obama administration after seeing marquees on the South Lawn for a foreign leader banquet. But one of the perks of a state dinner invite, in the East Room for instance, is that it’s cozy. Wherever you sit, you’re within a few feet of the president. That’s what makes it special.Of all the shocking things Trump has done so far in his second term, the bulldozing of the East Wing is the most tangible. Backhoes hacking away at the white plaster are likely to be among the defining images of this turbulent political era. But does the desecration of a not especially distinguished piece of architecture that most Americans will never visit really matter that much when millions are struggling with high grocery prices and rent? Probably not. That’s unless this moment comes to symbolize an increasingly profligate administration with plenty of cash for its pet priorities, like a $20 billion bailout for Argentina, but that seems oblivious to the cost of living — and dying, given high health care premiums.Perhaps Trump will live up to his promises and prove he’s one of America’s great builders, and the new facility will become as beloved as the East Wing in time. But given the long list of corporate donors, it may end up as a monument to corruption and an administration that supped with oligarchs. (It is not the first White House renovation to be privately funded; President Gerald Ford’s swimming pool, for instance, was controversial at the time.)Maybe the president is just misunderstood; maybe he’s being unfairly pilloried for gifting the nation a beautiful new gathering place. But this might also be the latest disconcerting echo of an autocratic-style obsession with grand projects that will tower over citizens when leaders are gone. Trump is also thinking of disrupting the classic Washington skyline with a huge arch across the Arlington Memorial Bridge from the Lincoln Memorial to mark America’s 250th birthday next year.Ironically, the East Wing came tumbling down days after millions of Americans took part in anti-Trump protests last weekend under the banner of “No Kings.” The relative modesty of the White House, compared with the great castles and palazzos of Europe, was a reminder that the United States freed itself from monarchs and doesn’t need its leaders to live in palaces.Trump seems to disagree.© 2025 Cable News Network.

His fishing boat had capsized.Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned.\"When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,\" said Mr Hong.Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats sunk or capsized.\"The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,\" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association.\"Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.\"Alarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C.Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to \"stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters\".On a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.\"I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,\" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. \"The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\"A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.\"Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,\" he said. \"If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.\"Professor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.\"Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,\" he told the BBC.Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.One foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled.As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.\"In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,\" he said. \"But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish.\"This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.Even the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.\"The haul is basically worthless,\" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.\"The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,\" Park continued. \"I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.\"And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier.Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as \"a vicious and tragic cycle\".When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, \"you have a higher chance of meeting disaster\", she explained.On 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery.One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat.\"It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,\" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. \"Ultimately it is their call when to go out,\" she said.As a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. \"Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,\" she said.Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. \"Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.\"The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.Because the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.\"The future looks very bleak,\" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last.\"Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.\"\"These days it's just really tough.\"Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun ChoiHere's what you should know as the US president arrives for a whirlwind week of diplomacy.Fishing and pollution concerns follow the sinking of a drifting boat by the coastguard.A committee of MPs says the government has not demonstrated if economic benefits from airport expansion outweigh climate impacts.Three people are on trial accused of spraying Stonehenge with orange powder.Labour ministers have been criticised for giving less than 8% of a £360m package to Scotland, which lands more than half of the UK's catch .Copyright 2025 BBC.

We didn't do that because it seemed unreasonable,\" Bisharo Abdirahman Omar said.The reaction was unsurprising as the Somali-speaking nomadic community earn their living by raising livestock, which are often threatened by predators such as cheetahs, leopards, lions, and hyenas.\"We knew it wouldn't benefit us in any way, like livestock would,\" said Rashid Abdi Hussein, a 45-year-old father of 10.\"But I decided that since people are killing these animals, maybe we should raise them instead and be different.\"The family cared for the cub for two years and three months, during which it became an inseparable part of the family.\"The animal was troublesome at first, but in the end, it became tame and became one of the children,\" he said.The family fed the cub milk through a syringe at first, then meat when it was old enough.\"We have made a big sacrifice - since the day I rescued it, I have slaughtered 15 sheep to feed the cheetah,\" Mr Hussein told the BBC.The family have been praised by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) for their generosity in looking after an animal which is often killed or trafficked.Sharmaarke Mohamed, head of the Northeastern Conservancy Association (NECA), says cheetahs and wildlife across north-eastern Kenya are facing a growing crisis that has gone largely unnoticed.\"Cheetahs are currently facing a very grave threat, along with many other wild animals,\" he said.\"This young cheetah that was recently found was most likely orphaned, its mother was either killed or poisoned,\" he said.According to the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the smuggling of baby cheetahs is widespread in the region, with active trafficking routes running through northern Kenya, eastern Ethiopia, and Somalia.The organization estimates that between 200 and 300 cheetah cubs are smuggled out of the Horn of Africa each year, many of which are transported to Yemen and then distributed across the Gulf States to be illegally sold as pets.Ms Omar said the family were approached by people who wanted to buy the young cheetah but they refused to sell it.\"While we were taking care of it, there were people who offered us money. Some even said they would pay 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($155; £115),\" she told the BBC.\"Others suggested we trade it for goats, but we refused because it had become part of the family.\"While KWS praised the family for looking after the cheetah, it pointed out that keeping wild animals as pets is against the law.\"We deeply appreciate the Good Samaritan's compassion and remind all Kenyans that true coexistence means protecting wildlife,\" the agency said.The young cheetah is now being taken care of at the Nairobi Safari Walk.Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaThe Jebel Marra area is neutral in the war but its produce cannot get out to feed a hungry nation.Andry Rajoelina, who was removed from power in a coup last week, had already acquired French nationality.The false belief that body parts of people with albinism bring wealth or luck have driven attacks.Issa Tchiroma Bakary says he won the election and is not concerned about being arrested or put in jail.Cameroon opposition leader Issa Tchiroma Bakary is adamant that he's the winner of the presidential election.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Headlines reported that it was the worst post-Diwali air quality the city had experienced in the past four years.With that, the city once again found itself confronting its annual, predictable - yet avoidable - crisis: air pollution.There isn't a single factor to blame for the toxic air.It's a combination of events - firecrackers, vehicular emissions and the burning of crop residue in the agrarian states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - that leads to the same outcome every year. And as it coincides with the start of winter, colder temperatures and low wind speeds trap pollutants close to the ground.This year too, the same factors are believed to be at play - although there are contradictory reports about what contributed how much to the toxic air this year.Indian media reports, citing a climate research firm, say there has been a 77% decline in stubble-burning incidents this year because of the devastating floods that destroyed much of the region's crops earlier. It blames firecrackers as being the main cause for Delhi's poor air during the festive period.But official data from Punjab tells a different story, PTI news agency reported. According to the regional pollution control board, stubble-burning incidents in the state have gone up three times in the past 10 days, with more than 350 cases reported - up from just 116 recorded until 11 October.In the past few years, authorities have launched targeted campaigns to highlight the harmful impact of stubble burning and to promote the use of machinery as an alternative.These efforts have shown some results on the ground. For instance, farm fires in Punjab fell to 10,909 cases last year as against 36,663 in 2023. But despite the decline, it continues for a simple reason: affordability. It remains the cheapest way to clear fields.And while successive governments have spoken about providing machinery and financial incentives to discourage crop burning, very little has changed on the ground.The other major contributor to Delhi's pollution in this season is firecrackers.Just days before the Diwali festival, India's top court relaxed a five-year ban on selling and bursting of crackers in Delhi and surrounding areas. It permitted the use of less-polluting \"green crackers\" for six hours over two days over the festival. Experts criticised the order saying \"green crackers\" are only 20-to-30% less polluting and still release harmful particles that degrade air quality.Also, the reality on the ground was far from what the court mandated and the restrictions were openly flouted.In many parts of the capital, fireworks started early in the morning and continued well past midnight. And not all of them were \"green crackers\" either. In the run-up to Diwali, BBC reporters saw more polluting crackers also being sold openly in shops.The polluted air that people are being forced to breathe has residents complaining of coughing, watery eyes and breathlessness. And doctors say long-term exposure gradually weakens the body's natural defences, making people more prone to a host of serious ailments.Yet, the human cost of pollution rarely becomes a priority for the region's elected representatives, as political parties resort to the familiar cycle of blame every year.This year too, the Delhi government and the one in Punjab have been engaged in a war of words.Delhi's Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa accused Punjab officials of \"forcing farmers to burn stubble\" to deliberately worsen the capital's air.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which governs Punjab, dismissed the allegations and, in turn, accused the Delhi government of \"lying about pollution\" and \"playing with people's lives\".Meanwhile, experts and some citizens say the only way forward is through collective, long-term solutions, where both state and federal governments work together rather than relying on temporary, reactionary pollution control measures each winter.For now, as winter creeps in, Delhi and much of northern India choke once again - a tragic annual routine that shows no signs of ending.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.A new biography shows how MS Swaminathan helped India leap from hunger to food self-sufficiency.The bus was carrying 234 smartphones that likely ruptured, exacerbating the fire, officials told local media.Rohit Sharma scores his 50th international hundred as India thrash Australia in the third one-day international to secure a consolation win.Microsoft founder and philanthropist makes a surprise appearance in former federal minister Smriti Irani's show.India team will require self-belief and the zeal to clinch its long-standing dream.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Major global companies, including Netflix, Starbucks and United Airlines, were temporarily unable to give customers access to their online services.“We apologize for the impact this event caused our customers,” Amazon said in a statement on the AWS website. “We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. We will do everything we can to learn from this event and use it to improve our availability even further.”You thought Monday’s internet outage was bad? Just waitAt a high level, the issue stemmed from two programs competing to write the same DNS entry – essentially a record in the internet’s phonebook – at the same time, which resulted in an empty entry. That threw multiple AWS services into disarray.“The analogy of a telephone book is pretty apt in that the folks on the other line are there, but if you don’t know how to reach them, then you have a problem,” Angelique Medina, head of Cisco’s ThousandEyes Internet Intelligence network monitoring service, told CNN. “And that telephone book effectively went poof.”Indranil Gupta, a professor of electrical and computing engineering at the University of Illinois, used a classroom analogy to explain Amazon’s technical analysis in an email to CNN. Say two students, one who is a fast worker, the other who is a slower worker, are asked to collaborate on a shared notebook.The slower student “pays attention in brief bursts, but their work may conflict or contradict the work of the faster student,” he wrote. At the same time, the quicker student may be “trying to constantly ‘fix’ things quickly” and delete the slower student’s work because it’s outdated.“The result… an empty page (or crossed out page) in the lab notebook, when the teacher comes and inspects it,” he wrote.That “empty page” brought down AWS’ DynamoDB database, creating a cascading effect that impacted other AWS services like EC2, which offers virtual servers for developing and deploying apps, and Network Load Balancer, which manages demands across the network. When DynamoDB came back online, EC2 tried to bring all of its servers back online at once and couldn’t keep up.Amazon is making a number of changes to its systems following the outage, including fixing the “race condition scenario,” which caused the two systems to overwrite each others’ work in the first place, and adding an additional test suite for its EC2 service.Outages like Monday’s, while rare, are just a reality, Gupta said. But what matters is how such issues are addressed.“Large scale outages like this, they just happen. There’s nothing you can do to avoid it, just like (how) people get ill,” Gupta told CNN over the phone. “But I think how the company reacts to the outages and keeps customers informed is really, really key.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

And their luck may not change anytime soon.The Federal Reserve began to lower interest rates last month to support the labor market and is expected to deliver another rate cut in the coming days. Companies across most industries, including technology, have pumped the brakes on hiring this year, hesitant to make those kinds of investments without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump’s sweeping economic policies.A string of rate cuts should eventually bolster hiring by making it more feasible for companies to expand headcounts. But lower rates cannot easily counteract the economic uncertainty that continues to bedevil businesses or address AI’s structural impact on entry-level tech jobs.“Layoffs and reductions in hiring plans due to AI use are expected to increase, especially for workers with a college degree,” Fed Governor Christopher Waller said during an October 15 event in Arlington, Virginia.“For policymakers, we must let the disruption occur and trust that the long-run benefits will exceed any short-run costs,” he said.Lower interest rates typically incentivize companies to staff up. But businesses also need clarity on future costs when developing hiring plans, a challenging task amid Trump’s ongoing bid to reshape global trade.“The labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,” Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. “So long as economic uncertainty is high, it’s hard to know how many people you should hire.”The situation has stabilized somewhat since the spring when Trump unveiled his massive Liberation Day tariffs. The Trump administration has announced a handful of successful trade deals since then, but Trump’s trade war is far from settled. On Thursday, the president called off trade talks with Canada after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff ad.Trump has also lashed out at China over its restrictions on rare earth exports and his administration is launching a probe looking into whether China complied with a trade agreement from 2019. Trump is expected to have a wide-ranging discussion with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping during an upcoming meeting in South Korea.In the meantime, businesses of all sizes and across most industries are still unsure of what the future might hold as US trade policy continues to evolve, even with the Fed expected to deliver additional rate cuts through 2026.“There’s still policy uncertainty, but everyone realizes substantial tariffs are now most likely here to stay. And now we have to navigate it,” Rich Lesser, Boston Consulting Group’s global chair, said in an analysis of third-quarter earnings calls by BCG and Bloomberg Media Studios.A survey of 130 CEOs released on October 16 by the Conference Board, showed that their expectations for the economy in the next six months “turned from neutral to pessimistic,” and that 68% said they plan to maintain or shrink the size of their workforce.AI is beginning to automate some tasks usually done by an entry-level technology worker, possibly resulting in a structural shift in the technology industry’s labor market. And tech companies are increasingly adopting the technology; a Google study from September found that 90% of tech workers are using AI at work.The Fed’s key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly, functions through demand, not supply. That means it’s good at boosting demand to shore up the labor market, which is currently what the central bank is trying to do, but it does nothing about supply-side issues.“You do have a bit of a mismatch,” said David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura. “You have a lot of people who are new (computer science) graduates from college, but there doesn’t seem to be enough demand for these entry-level workers.”Job postings in the technology and mathematics industry on Indeed were down 35% in early October compared to February 2020, with certain titles, such as developers and designers, seeing the steepest declines. Meanwhile, AI and data center-focused roles have seen a massive increase in job postings during the same period.“Higher unemployment among recent college graduates is primarily a function of a structural shift in hiring in the tech sector amid strong labor supply growth,” Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in an analyst note published earlier this year.“Computer and mathematical science occupations are disproportionately exposed to automation and displacement,” he added.The Conference Board’s latest CEO survey showed that most of the business leaders surveyed expect AI “to fundamentally transform over 50% of the job roles in their organization in the next 5 years.”Young Americans who studied computer science for the promise of a good-paying job are now grappling with the harsh economics that come with a new, disruptive technology.“It feels like I’m competing with AI to just try to get my foot in the door,” Abraham Rubio, who graduated with a degree in computer science and game programming from Bloomfield College of Montclair State University in New Jersey earlier this year, told CNN previously.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

And Los Angeles did not stop there.After getting Teoscar Hernandez to strike out, Gausman gave up another solo shot — this time to Max Muncy as the Dodgers extended their lead and knocked the 34-year-old out of the game.It was the first postseason game in MLB history where two pitchers retired 17 or more consecutive batters, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.The Dodgers tacked on two more runs in the eighth inning before Yamamoto was able to close things out.It was the first complete game in a World Series since 2015, when the Kansas City Royals’ Johnny Cueto against the New York Mets in Game 2.Yamamoto is also the first pitcher since Curt Schilling to throw consecutive complete games in a postseason.

That might sound a bit extreme, but bad things can happen in there,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson earlier this week.“I don’t want to die in the cage. I definitely don’t want to. But it’s a dangerous sport. The idea is to hurt the other person.“It’s them or me, one of us has to get beat up, and it’s going to have to be them, it’s as simple as that,” he said.The “other person” on Saturday will be Ciryl Gane, himself a former interim heavyweight champion. The fight represents Aspinall’s first defense of the undisputed title he claimed when former holder Jon Jones retired in June.Despite not defeating a reigning champion to gain his title, Aspinall has established himself as the dominant figure in the heavyweight division. The Englishman is 8-1 in the UFC, with his only loss coming when he sustained an unfortunate non-contact injury 15 seconds into his 2022 fight against Curtis Blaydes.Having claimed all but one of his wins in the first round, Aspinall also holds the record for the shortest average fight time in UFC history.Aspinall does not believe he is the dominant name in the sport just yet, but is clearly proud of his ascent to the top of his division.“I don’t know if I’m the face. I think that’s a bit unfair on a couple of other people to say that I’m the face,” he said.“But I keep telling myself that this is where I wanted to be, the first time I put the gloves on. And all these years later, this is where we are.”From ‘one of the lowest points’ of his life to interim UFC heavyweight champion: the rise of Tom AspinallAspinall’s status within the sport would make him a strong candidate to feature in President Donald Trump’s proposed UFC fight on the White House lawn, and the 32-year-old would not turn down the opportunity were it to come his way.“If it was offered to me, yeah. Absolutely I would. I’d fight anywhere in the world,” he said. “If I’m still the champion by then, whoever the number one contender is, that’s who I’ll fight.”“I think any time a big name like (Trump), or somebody else of his stature, is involved with the sport and they’re attached to it, there’s more eyes on the sport,” he said.As both Aspinall and the UFC itself continue to garner more and more fans, the Manchester-born fighter is just trying to remain focused on the next bout.“As my emotions are building up, I have to like, try and calm myself down a little bit and be like ‘Listen, I just need to be on before 11 o’clock on Saturday,’” he explained.“Until then I need to try and relax.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

They speak in (their own) languages. It’s a really fascinating community.”That’s what Stone’s algorithm is pushing her towards?“Oh yeah, baby,” the actor said, letting out one of her trademark husky laughs. “Oh yeah.”“Bugonia,” directed by Stone’s frequent collaborator Yorgos Lanthimos (“Poor Things,” “The Favourite”) and written by Will Tracy (“Succession,” “The Menu”), doesn’t dive down the starseed/New Age fringe belief rabbit hole. Instead, it addresses extraterrestrial conspiracies and the darkest corners of the human imagination; where the scapegoats for mankind’s failings live not on Earth but among the stars. It’s also very funny.An adaptation of 2003 South Korean movie “Save the Green Planet!,” Tracy transplants the story to an anonymous corner of the US. There, Stone’s exec Michelle is the cold face of corporate America, paying lip service to DEI and work-life balance, with a power already alien to all but the 0.1%. She’s quickly kidnapped by cousins Teddy and Don (Jesse Plemons and newcomer Aidan Delbis, respectively), who have reason to believe she’s from Andromeda and behind Earth’s ecological collapse. In their dimly lit basement, Teddy will do everything he can to extract a confession.It’s the second Lanthimos film in a row in which Plemons has squared off against Stone and accused her character of being an imposter. The last time was in the diabolical triptych “Kinds of Kindness,” which last year had audience members fainting in the aisles (much to Plemons’ delight). “Bugonia” gives them more runway, teasing out the facts of Michelle and Teddy’s lives between bouts of violence and psychological warfare. The actors do cartwheels along a tightrope to nail the tone, which teeters between dark comedy and tragedy – quintessentially Lanthimos.“I remember cracking up when we were rehearsing it, but then by the time we got into the basement, it didn’t seem as funny,” said Plemons.“You needed to lock in,” added Stone. “We were shooting on VistaVision (a recently revived way of shooting 35mm film), which is a really gorgeous but very moody camera. And there is an element that’s added to each take, like, is it going to keep rolling or is it going to sputter out?“It really adds to a sort of insistence and focus in the midst of scenes that’s amazing, and part of the reason I love shooting on film so much … You can’t really screw around.”Many of “Save The Green Planet!”’s conspiracy-laced themes have been sharpened in Tracy’s adaptation and find extra bite in their new setting. For all the traumas Teddy has endured, we’re left thinking it’s no wonder he believes in aliens, but not in his fellow man.“It was important to me to, at this moment in cultural history – certainly American cultural history – make a movie about people who would be described as conspiracy theorists and to approach them with empathy,” said Tracy. “Because at the moment, I think so much of that mindset has been cynically co-opted by current political movements and (the) current White House.”“There’s an instinct to think that everyone who believes in anything that’s not the ‘official story’ is stupid or crazy or right wing,” he added.“I think underlying a lot of Teddy’s ideas are some truths about the abuses of big pharma, big tech, government, capitalism generally. He’s a victim of that, and I think he’s been pushed into a corner where he has to make his own truth.”For Lanthimos, “Bugonia” is a minor departure, as it brings what’s usually found in the subtext of his films to the fore.“I think all of my films are political … even if it’s not mentioned within the film,” he said, while agreeing that “this film is more directly political” than his previous work.The director has thrown up a warped mirror to society since 2005’s “Kinetta,” finding oblique angles to confront how weird and cruel humanity can be. In “Dogtooth,” three siblings are confined to the family home and made to believe the outside world is unsafe; in “The Lobster” singletons are forced to couple up or be transfigured into an animal of their choosing; in “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” a young man demands blood after a surgeon kills his father on the operating table; and in “Kinds of Kindness,” three short stories dovetail along the theme of sub-dom human relationships.Arbitrary rulemaking and punishments, absurdism and fringe beliefs are part and parcel of Lanthimos’ storytelling. But in “Bugonia,” the warped mirror he presents has never felt so flush with reality.“I do think we live in unprecedented times – for my lifetime, at least,” the director said.“The world has changed drastically, with climate change, politically, with wars, genocides, financially – whatever, you name it.”“Those things that we explore around characters and stories reflect that reality even stronger, in a way, and we recognize these things more directly. It does have to do with the state of the world right now.”Plemons described shooting the movie as “survival mode.” Maybe that was just art-making imitating life.“Bugonia” lands in select US theaters on October 24 before expanding, and in UK theaters on October 31.© 2025 Cable News Network.

Her cozy knit pullover was weather-appropriate for a fall October evening, but formal wear puritans might question whether it was red carpet-appropriate.Sweaters are not often associated with glamorous event arrivals, at least not in recent memory. For the last 15 or so years, celebrities have been, in general, more trussed up, as red carpets have become a heightened economic prospective for stars and designers alike. These days, it’s not unusual for an ornate gown to come with a sculptural headpiece, or be completed by a train that reaches beyond several meters. Earlier this year the Cannes Film Festival organizers even went as far as banning “voluminous outfits, in particular those with a large train,” in their red carpet dress code after the “flow of traffic of guests” was being disrupted by too many larger-than-life frocks. Of course, no one really listened.Lawrence’s ensemble still fit the bill (it was from Jonathan Anderson’s debut womenswear collection for Dior, after all). But it still ran counter to the impulse to do the most, refusing the popular strategy of wearing the biggest, boldest gown — or, lately, the most transparent dress. There’s a reason nostalgic photos of 1990s film premieres are constantly recirculated on the internet: Red carpets looked more fun three decades ago.In a world before stylists and social media, celebrities had room to dress according to their mood and personal taste — not to mention the freedom to experiment away from the pitchforks of an Instagram comment section. Despite Lawrence’s outfit being straight from the runway, her easy-breezy, slouchy sweater called back to another era of Hollywood dressing. It also seemed to ask: Can red carpet fashion loosen up a bit?Lawrence’s style choices have posed that question before, for example when she paired a Dior red princess gown with a pair of black flip flops at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023. But she isn’t the only one challenging expectations. Last month, comedian and actor Megan Stalter made headlines for defying red carpet tradition by wearing a pair of blue Levi’s jeans and a white T-shirt to the 2025 Emmys.The surprising history of the Fair Isle sweater“I think people need to bring back jeans on the red carpet,” Stalter told Variety. “They were in the ‘90s… there’s no rules. You’re allowed to do what you want.”There have been other rumblings of a red carpet resistance: Taylor Russell dressed in vintage Levi’s and a Gucci white fur bolero for the Fashion Awards in 2022, and Kristen Stewart’s sweater dress (albeit sequinned and Chanel) at the Toronto Film Festival in 2018. But A-listers looking to really disrupt the sartorial status quo must make bigger statements — by being decidedly more understated.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Replacing a tooth often requires invasive surgery and implanting a titanium screw into a patient’s jawbone, then waiting months for that to strengthen into an artificial root, before attaching a crown or cap on top of it.But research groups around the world are working to find ways to implant or grow real biological teeth in a human jaw.That may be a way off, but at King’s College London, Ana Angelova Volponi, director of the postgraduate program in regenerative dentistry, has been experimenting with lab-grown teeth for almost two decades, and was part of a team that in 2013 grew a tooth from human and mouse cells.This year, she led a study that built upon that work and achieved a breakthrough in the material used to house the growing tooth in the lab, which better mimics the actual environment where biological teeth grow in the mouth. It’s a key step on the way to replacing the mouse cells with human cells and stimulating them to form a tooth.The idea of creating lab-grown teeth dates back to the 1980s, Volponi said, but the one that she and her colleagues created over a decade ago was the first that used adult human gingival cells — which make up the gums and are obtained by lightly scratching the inside of the mouth — and combined them with “progenitor” tooth cells taken from a mouse embryo.“It’s almost like a tripod,” she said about the elements that contribute to growing a tooth in a lab setting. “The two types of cells are engaging in tooth making, in a sort of conversation, and then we have the environment where this happens.”The environment, which researchers call a “scaffold,” is essential to the formation of the lab-grown tooth, and it’s the subject of Volponi’s most recent study. In 2013, Volponi used a scaffold made of the protein collagen, but now uses a hydrogel, a type of polymer with a high water content, explained Xuechen Zhang, a doctoral student at King’s College London, and a co-author of the study. “We gather the cells first from the mouse embryos and then mix them together and spin them down to get a small cell pellet,” he said. “Then we inject this cell pellet inside the hydrogel and grow it for around eight days.” Because the work focused on the environment, human cells aren’t needed.At the end of the eight days, tooth-like structures will have formed inside the hydrogel, which was developed in collaboration with Imperial College London. In the 2013 research, these “tooth primordia” were transferred into a mouse where they developed into a tooth structure complete with developing roots and enamel.Many challenges remain before a lab-grown tooth can be used in a human patient, but the new material helps with some pieces of that puzzle, Volponi said, by improving the “conversation” between the cells that are tasked with making a tooth.Researchers still don’t know exactly how to replace the embryonic mouse cells with adult human cells, but if that puzzle is solved, Volponi envisions two possible ways to integrate lab-grown teeth into everyday dentistry: “We either grow a tooth up to a certain stage of development, and then embed it into the (tooth socket), where a lost tooth was and where the new one will have the potential to fully grow into a biological tooth, incorporating itself within the organic structures such as the bone and the ligament. Or, we fully grow the tooth first and then implant it surgically. It’s still too early to say which approach will be more viable.”A real, biological replacement tooth grown from a patient’s own cells would offer many advantages over a crown or implant. First, it would be accepted into the tissue without inflammation or rejection, but it would also feel exactly like a real tooth — unlike implants that lack feeling and elasticity as they are simply fused into the bone.According to Vitor C. M. Neves, a senior clinical lecturer at the School of Clinical Dentistry of the University of Sheffield in England, Volponi has long been a pioneer in the field of whole tooth regeneration, serving as an inspiration to many researchers around the world. “Her new research tackles a key factor in the production and potential industrialization of this technology — the use of matrices in whole tooth regeneration,” said Neves, who was not involved with Volponi’s study.The findings, he added, highlight the importance of creating an environment that can support whole tooth engineering for clinical application: “The more researchers who contribute to advancing this field, the sooner humanity will be able to reap its benefits.”This tiny robot spins blood clots awayOther researchers working in the same field are using a variety of different techniques to grow teeth.Katsu Takahashi and his colleagues at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka are developing an antibody-based treatment aimed at promoting the growth of teeth in people with conditions such as anodontia, or the congenital lack of teeth. The treatment has entered human clinical trials and could be ready by the end of the decade.In late 2024, a team led by Pamela Yelick at the School of Dental Medicine of Tufts University, grew human-like teeth — created from human and pig cells — in pigs. Pigs, unlike humans, regrow their teeth several times over the course of their lives. The ultimate aim is to prompt cells in a human jaw to grow new teeth, without using any pig cells.At the University of Washington, a team led by Hannele Ruohola-Baker, a professor of biochemistry and an associate director of the university’s Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, has successfully grown dental pulp stem cells from human stem cells mined from donated wisdom teeth: “We aim to uncover the molecular blueprint of human tooth formation and to recreate that process in the laboratory,” she said. “While Volponi’s study builds tooth-like structures from existing dental tissues, our platform generates the key human tooth-forming cell types (from scratch) and guides them along authentic developmental trajectories.”As for when the fruits of all this research will become available, Ruohola-Baker believes we won’t have to wait that long. “Although clinical translation will take time, momentum in this field is accelerating, heralding a future in which biological tooth repair or replacement becomes a realistic option within the coming decade,” she said.© 2025 Cable News Network.

The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that published Thursday in the journal Science.In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.“It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.“The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.“Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first described as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.Iceland just found its first mosquitoes“We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.“Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Building incentives will help me exercise more. Good friendships will help me live longer.As a wellness writer, I spend a lot of my days reporting on new research findings in the health and wellness field, vetted by outside experts, usually including advice on how to live better.But this time, I don’t have the results to offer –– you do.Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Alberta are looking for a large pool of participants for a new study. With CNN having covered so many studies like this one, the researchers are hoping readers will want to participate — and CNN is following along to report on the research process from the ground floor.All you have to do is take a daily quiz on the research team’s website to assess what you know about healthy habits.WANT TO JOIN ME? You can sign up for the quiz here on the researchers’ website and get started right away.“This is actually an opportunity for folks to contribute to research by joining our website,” said lead researcher Dr. Katie Mehr, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Alberta. “After the study concludes and we’re able to analyze all the data, we will share what we found with the readership.”The quiz is just two questions, every day for 30 days, that are designed to help participants learn more about their well-being in a quick, easy and fun way. The research requires those who participate to be over 18 years old, be a US resident and have a US phone number that can receive texts.Researchers can’t share exactly what questions they are investigating because that could risk skewing the results. But the study team hopes the experience will be a way for people to engage with science and pull back the curtain on how the questions about human behavior are answered, Mehr said.“Sometimes there’s these questions where, if we could get a large sample of people who were dealing with this in their life to engage science, we could learn a lot,” said behavioral researcher Dr. Katy Milkman, James G. Dinan Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “Sometimes it’s hard to figure out where do you meet those people.”This study is “a fun opportunity for people to be part of what they’re constantly reading and … get to be part of the news,” Milkman said. “They will change the news like citizen scientists.”Focusing on what behaviors can actually help is an important first step toward a healthier life, Milkman said. That is especially true in a time when science isn’t at its most popular and influencers often share information not backed by research.You might not know that the research suggests that the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest ways of eating, but you heard from an influencer that cutting out carbs and only eating red meat is key to longevity.Don’t waste time and money on trendy wellness hacks. Try these things that actually workIf you set a goal of bettering your nutrition but don’t have the information to guide you toward the best path to accomplish it, you might be working against yourself, Milkman said.You may think you know what you need to do to achieve your health goals and are just struggling with implementing the change, Milkman said. But these upcoming results may help you do an even better job working toward increasing your health and longevity.Once you have the information about where you can make improvements to your health, the next step is to define your goal, Milkman said.Most people would say they would like to be healthier, but an effective goal — say one more hour of sleep each night or two sessions of strength training per week — is more specific than that, she added.If you know you want more balanced nutrition, set a goal with the kinds of food you want to incorporate, and then make a realistic plan that covers how many meals or how many days a week you will build them into your routine, Milkman said.“Ideally, those goals even include when you will do it, where you will do it, and how you will get there,” she said.A lot of people get tripped up in the follow-through, so using strategies to keep you on track is critical, Milkman said.In her research, Milkman has found that figuring out a way to make the behavior you’re incorporating instantly gratifying, rewarding and fun helps you look forward to it instead of harboring a sense of dread.“We often focus too much on those long-term results,” she said.How your seasonal chores count toward your fitness goalsOne method is temptation bundling, in which you pair your goal behavior with an activity you enjoy –– like watching your favorite TV show while you are on the elliptical, Milkman said.“Now, instead of dreading my workout, there’s a reason to look forward to it,” she said.Making your goal behavior more social can also help you stick to it, Milkman added. People are more likely to get to the gym at 3 p.m. if they are meeting a friend there and know they will have someone to talk with to stay motivated.Timing your goal setting with a moment that feels like a “change of chapter” can also be helpful, and those times can include the new year, a birthday or the start of the school year –– whether or not you have kids going to school, Mehr said.“Those new beginnings tend to be moments when we’re more willing to sort of step back and think big picture,” Milkman said. “It is a fresh-start moment in the fall.”SIGN UP to participate in the study here.© 2025 Cable News Network.

It’s estimated that more than 80% of women have hot flashes during menopause.An experimental pill cut hot flashes and improved sleep for women in menopause — without using hormones“This FDA approval represents a bold step forward – our first hormone-free treatment for alleviating vasomotor symptoms of menopause,” Christine Roth, Bayer’s executive vice president of global product strategy and commercialization, said in a news release Friday.“There is a need for more individualized approaches to menopause care, and Lynkuet addresses a significant gap in treatment options,” she said.For many women, hormone therapy can be a safe and effective treatment for menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. But some with underlying health conditions or histories, including certain cancers, are sometimes advised against using hormone replacement therapies. Experts say that for those women, alternative treatment options can be helpful.What do you want to know about hormone replacement for menopause symptoms?A Phase 3 clinical trial of elinzanetant that included 628 postmenopausal women found that those taking the drug for 12 weeks reported a more than 73% reduction in the frequency of their vasomotor symptoms, or VMS. In contrast, those taking a placebo reported a 47% reduction.The most common side effects in women taking the drug were drowsiness, fatigue and headaches.“This yearlong study not only confirmed the initial findings of rapid and significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats but also provided evidence that these effects were sustained over a year, offering hope for longer-term relief,” researcher Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, UVA Health’s director of midlife health and emeritus executive director of the North American Menopause Society, said in a statement last month when the trial findings were published.“For those dealing with moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, the treatment options have been limited, especially for those who cannot or choose not to undergo hormone therapy,” Pinkerton said. “The disruptive nature of these bothersome hot flashes, particularly when they are more severe, can significantly affect women’s daily lives, both at work and at home, underscoring the urgent need for effective non-hormonal treatments.”What to know about menopause, according to a doctorHot flashes are a sudden feeling of being very hot that’s usually centered around the face, chest and head. They can also cause intense sweating and flushing that may last several minutes. When this happens at night, it’s called a night sweat. Women in menopause may get them occasionally or many times a day, which can be extremely disruptive.“It’s important that women know they have choices for treating moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, and today’s approval further expands a woman’s options for treating these symptoms,” Claire Gill, president and founder of the National Menopause Foundation, said in Bayer’s announcement Friday.In 2023, the FDA approved the menopause drug fezolinetant, which also works as an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapies for managing hot flashes. Fezolinetant and elinzanetant are among the first drugs to take advantage of a newly understood pathway in the brain that appears to control hot flashes.As estrogen decreases during menopause, nerves in the hypothalamus — an almond-size region deep inside the brain whose functions include helping regulate the body’s thermostat — become hyperactive and produce an overabundance of chemical signals called neurokinins. Both of the new drugs block the doorways on cells where certain neurokinins dock, which turns down their ability to stimulate the brain to cause hot flashes.“Hot flashes, particularly when severe, can have an impact on women’s daily lives,” Pinkerton said in Bayer’s announcement. “This approval provides healthcare providers with a new treatment option that can be used first-line for moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.”CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.© 2025 Cable News Network.

While it gives the elephants a powerful and distinctive appearance, it also makes them vulnerable to poaching.Fewer than 30 of these giants remain in Africa, according to the Tsavo Trust, which monitors elephant populations in Kenya’s Tsavo Conservation Area.Most of the surviving super tuskers, also known as “great tuskers,” are found in southern Kenya, where Italian-born photographer Federico Veronesi has spent years tracking and photographing them. His new book, “Walk the Earth,” the culmination of years of work in Kenya and beyond, pays tribute to the elephants he calls “the last witnesses of a world before humans took over the Earth.”As a child growing up in Italy, Veronesi was captivated by African wildlife. That fascination led him to Kenya, where he eventually settled and began photographing the animals he had admired for so long.“Photography is almost like a medium through which I get to stay among the animals and express my love for them,” said Veronesi.Elephants became his central focus, not just for their grandeur, but for the way they seemed to embody the soul of Africa for him. “When you see an elephant walking through a savanna,” he reflected, “it’s so evocative, like everything about Africa is in that one scene.”The book is rooted in Veronesi’s encounters with some of Kenya’s most iconic elephants. One of the most significant came in 2010, when he first saw Tim, the legendary super tusker of Amboseli National Park.“We were waiting as the elephants made their daily walk from the woodlands to the marsh,” he remembered, “when this massive bull appeared with tusks so long, they nearly touched the ground.”For Veronesi, it was as if a childhood dream had become reality. Tim reminded him of tales of Ahmed, a great tusker so revered in Kenya that in the 1970s, President Jomo Kenyatta declared him a “living monument” and assigned him armed guards for protection.Last of the ‘Super Tuskers’: Saving Kenya’s majestic megafauna“Through the book I also wanted to show different aspects of elephants’ lives,” Veronesi said, “such as courtship with Tim, fighting, mud-bathing, swimming, reaching up for branches and social relationships.”Veronesi also sought to highlight the diversity of habitats where elephants live across Africa, from the deserts of Namibia to the Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater and Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe.Veronesi’s favorite image is one of Balguda, “probably the greatest tusker alive at the moment,” as described in his book. Balguda was only known from occasional sightings during aerial patrols and Veronesi spent years looking for him.In August 2023, in a remote corner of Tsavo, Balguda finally appeared. “I still can’t believe that I finally managed to see and photograph him, to have breathed the same air as him. The image of him walking in the riverbed will probably remain with me forever – one of my most intense encounters in the wild,” Veronesi writes in the book.“I always told myself, if I find him, then I will do the book,” he added.“Walk the Earth” is Veronesi’s third photography book, and he has been working on it for the past five years. It highlights the threats elephants face today: habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and the continued danger of trophy hunting, especially for the few remaining great tuskers.Veronesi has long used his photography to help protect wildlife. He says he donates images to conservation organizations, contributes to awareness campaigns and has spoken internationally, including in China, where he presented his wildlife photos to raise awareness about ivory demand.Veronesi strives to not only document elephants as specimens, but to portray them as individuals. “The goal is always to make the viewer connect with the animal, to look into its soul somehow,” he said.That connection requires patience and perspective. He often positions his camera low to the ground, so the elephant seems to tower over the frame. Many of his most powerful images are in black and white.“Elephants have this incredible aura of calm patience,” he said. “They convey a sense of wisdom, of knowledge. And at the same time, they’re extremely social and caring for each other.“They make everything seem fine. Like the whole world is grazing and nothing is happening.”© 2025 Cable News Network.

It was the mid 1970s, and he was with friends outside a shopping mall in the northern suburbs of his hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa. Someone may have looked the wrong way at a stranger’s girlfriend – his memory is fuzzy. What isn’t fuzzy is the sight of that stranger pointing a .45 Magnum in their direction.Luckily the situation de-escalated, and everyone walked away that day. But Ziman estimates by the time he was 50 he’d had a gun pulled on him 15 to 20 times. “I have to consider myself really lucky,” he said. Unsurprisingly, he said he’s “always been very anti-gun.”Ziman is a commercial photographer and filmmaker-turned-artist who resides in Los Angeles today. For over a decade he has made weapons the focus of his work, using tens of millions of hand-threaded beads to turn artifacts of war into artworks.“I want to talk about the proliferation of weapons around the world and the militarization of police forces,” he explained.His series “Weapons of Mass Production” recently concluded with Ziman’s most ambitious work to date: an entire fighter jet.Each artwork in the series has its own connection to South Africa’s recent past, and together they comprise a beautiful, subversive meditation on a nation’s history of violence.First, he created dozens of mock AK-47 rifles in 2013, adding beads to a wire frame. The AK-47, Ziman said, started as “weapon of liberation” during the apartheid years, then post-apartheid “started showing up in bank robberies, cash-in-transit robberies, home invasions (and) carjackings.”Next, in 2016, Ziman moved on to bedecking a Casspir – a heavily armored, mine-resistant vehicle that was created for the South African police and deployed in townships, which became “a hated symbol of apartheid,” he explained.In 2019, Ziman took on the challenge of beading an entire MiG-21. Why he chose the Soviet era fighter jet – the most produced military jet in the world – requires a little more explanation. In the 1980s, South Africa was involved in both the Angola Civil War (1975-2002) and the South African Border War (1966-1990). The Cold War proxy conflicts pulled in multiple entities, including Cuba, which flew MiG-21s against South Africa’s air force, inflicting loses in what proved a costly venture, financially and politically, for South Africa.Ziman and a team of over 100 artisans took more than five years to complete the artwork, which was revealed at The Museum of Flight in Seattle this summer.First, Ziman had to acquire a jet, which was sourced from a military contractor in Lakeland, Florida.“It was in pieces and not in great condition, but it was absolutely perfect for us,” he said. Ziman’s team removed the engine, loaded the rest onto a flatbed truck and took it to his studio in LA.Much of the design work was completed on the plane itself, using sheets of paper stuck to its aluminum panels. These sheets would be detailed using colored tape, then removed and shipped to South Africa. There, artisans from Zimbabwean and Ndebele communities in Johannesburg, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces began to recreate the panels in beads.The largest of the panels were over 20 feet wide and weighed 30-40 pounds once completed. The team estimates the jet, which is 51 feet long and 24 feet wide, is covered in approximately 35 million beads.“There’s no mechanized way of doing this, everything on that plane is 100% handmade,” said Ziman. “I can’t even begin to think about the hours that have gone into it.”There are easier, quicker ways of adding a splash color. Why beads?“I’d always loved beadwork,” said Ziman. “I’d grown up with it; I had an Ndebele nanny who always brought us beaded stuff.“Even though it took a tremendous amount of skill and this tremendous effort to make anything out of beads, it was looked down on. I always wanted to elevate it to being a fine art.”Many of the artisans employed by Ziman are part of Anointed Hands, a collective of beadworkers overseen by Thenjiwe Pretty Nkogatsi. ﻿“She is intensely passionate about keeping these beading skills alive in the Ndebele community,” he said.Preserving the livelihoods of these artisans became paramount during the Covid-19 pandemic, when other work dried up, said Ziman. But “Weapons of Mass Production” is also out to help the next generation.Through DTCare, the charity arm of international logistics firm DTGruelle (which supported the MiG-21 project), 25 of the artisans’ children and other young people are receiving sponsorship for their education.“We will pay for them through school, through university … as far as they want to go,” said Ziman. So far, scholarship students have studied medicine, nursing and fashion design, and one even plays for Zimbabwe’s under-21 cricket team, the artist added, beaming.The MiG-21 will go up for sale after a US tour, he said, with proceeds funding the education program, as well as art therapy for children in Ukraine.“I love the idea that we take this thing that was built in the Soviet Union … has been donated to us, and we can sell it and put some of that money back into helping some of the civilian population who’ve been so brutalized in the war (with Russia),” he added.Despite his series looking into South Africa’s past, Ziman believes it has ongoing relevance. The project, he said, “is maybe even more pertinent now than when we started.”He highlighted the Casspir police vehicle, one of the inspirations for US military MRAP (Mine Resistance Ambush Protected) vehicles used in the Second Gulf War. Hundreds of US military mine-resistant vehicles would eventually be made available to police departments through the Pentagon’s 1033 Program, and some used on US streets against protestors during the Black Lives Matter movement.“History doesn’t just rhyme, it actually seems to repeat itself,” said Ziman.This story has been updated to clarify the description of the Casspir vehicle and the beadwork artisans.© 2025 Cable News Network.

But identifying fossils in an area accurately dated to just before the extinction event is rare.A key site of interest for paleontologists has been the well-studied Hell Creek and Fort Union Formations, located in what is now Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.Hell Creek has preserved evidence of multiple species of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, as well as rocks, dated to the end of the Cretaceous Period, or just before the dinosaurs went extinct. But the dinosaur community there completely lacked any long-necked species, causing scientists to wonder if those had already disappeared.Researchers unearthed skeleton of extinct ‘hypercarnivore’ that had a taste for dinosaursNow, new research has dated rocks in the Naashoibito Member to the same time period as the Hell Creek Formation, revealing what kinds of dinosaurs lived in different parts of North America just a few hundred thousand years before going extinct.Among the dinosaurs that lived in the Naashoibito Member was Alamosaurus, one of the largest long-necked dinosaurs that ever lived, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.“What our new research shows is that dinosaurs are not on their way out going into the mass extinction,” lead study author Andrew Flynn, assistant professor in the department of geological sciences at New Mexico State University, said in a statement. “They’re doing great, they’re thriving, and that the asteroid impact seems to knock them out. This counters a long-held idea that there was this long-term decline in dinosaur diversity leading up to the mass extinction making them more prone to extinction.”Dinosaur fossils were first found in the San Juan Basin beginning in the mid- to late 1800s.But dating the rock layers containing the fossils is more complicated, Flynn said. First, the layers need to be exposed so they can be studied, and then the rocks themselves must be dated.“These factors make dinosaur-bearing rocks from the last 400,000 years of the Cretaceous quite rare,” Flynn said.  “Additionally, it takes years of work to establish the ages of rocks, with multiple lines of evidence needing to be collected, which sometimes discourages people from going to new areas to work.”Dinosaur eggs from China found to be around 86 million years old, according to ‘atomic clock’ datingThe fossil record is not neatly organized, and some chapters are missing.“Species might have failed to enter the fossil record, they might have been preserved as fossils but not yet discovered, or they might have been discovered but lack essential context, such as precise estimates of geological age,” wrote Dr. Lindsay Zanno, head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a related article published with the research. Zanno was not involved in the study.The Naashoibito Member site is problematic because erosion has stripped it of the perfect layers of rock found at other sites in North America, making it difficult to determine when the layers were created, Flynn said.Work at the site to determine a more detailed timeline of dinosaur habitation began in 2011. The team members measured the thickness and location of different rock layers, collected samples for testing and identified all of the spots where fossils were found over the last century and a half. Sample collection lasted about three to four years just for Cretaceous rocks, while another four to five were spent on the overlying rock that shows when mammals lived at the site after the dinosaurs went extinct.One way the team was able to date the rocks was by comparing the samples with Earth’s magnetic field, which periodically changes direction.For instance, right now, magnetic north aligns with the direction of north. But sometimes, magnetic north can align with the direction of south. Scientists have a clear understanding of when these reversals have occurred over time. By measuring the direction of the magnetic field when the rock layers were created, researchers can narrow down the time frame.“The end-Cretaceous mass extinction, fortunately for us, took place during a relatively short period of reversed polarity, which makes it much easier to say what our data correlates to,” Flynn said.I tried to find out if the dinosaur tooth I bought online was real. It didn’t go as expectedThe team also used radiometric dating — or measuring the decay of certain elements in rocks to determine their ages — on sand grains from sandstone in the Naashoibito Member.Their results showed that the dinosaur fossils were from a 380,000-year window leading up to the mass extinction event. The team also determined that mammals appeared about 350,000 years after the mass extinction event.The new study paints a portrait of two very different dinosaur communities divided between the north and south regions of the continent.Both areas had dinosaurs in common, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Torosaurus. Fossils of duck-billed dinosaurs were also found at each location, but they belonged to different groups. There were no giant, long-necked sauropods to be found in the north, which for a long time led some paleontologists to think that after millions of years of pushing the boundaries of evolution with their humongous sizes, they had gone extinct, said study coauthor Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.But they flourished in the south, including Alamosaurus, which reached 100 feet (30 meters) long, a height of 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 meters) and weighed over 30 tons, Brusatte said. The fact that one of the biggest dinosaurs, and one of the largest animals ever to live on Earth, witnessed an asteroid striking the planet truly illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving to the very end, he said.“I can imagine the scene, one minute a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid,” Brusatte said.Part of the reason for the differing groups divided between north and south was likely due to climate conditions, Flynn said.The Naashoibito Member site was like a warm and humid tropical forest, similar to conditions in modern Panama, while the Hell Creek area was at a much lower elevation and included the cooler conditions of an inland sea coastal plain.“They were doing what dinosaurs had been doing for over 150 million years, adapting to their local conditions, dividing up niches in the food chain, varying in size and shape and diet, exhibiting rich diversity across the landscape,” Brusatte said. “There is no sign that these dinosaurs were in any trouble.”‘Dragon prince’ dinosaur discovery is changing how scientists understand T. rexThe new evidence about diverse, late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is exciting, said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the School of Earth Sciences at the UK’s University of Bristol. Benton was not involved in the new study, and his previous research has suggested a decline in dinosaur populations before the asteroid strike.“However, this is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world,” Benton wrote in an email.“As the authors also show in the paper, in general dinosaurs of the last 6 million years of the Cretaceous were less diverse, falling from 43 species beforehand to 30 species in western North America. We would suggest that there is evidence for overall declines in dinosaurs towards the end of the Cretaceous, with individual rich faunas where climates were favourable.”But Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor within the department of Earth, energy, and environment at the University of Calgary, said she﻿ believes the new findings could change how researchers think about dinosaurs in North America before the mass extinction event.Zelenitsky was not involved in the new research, but her team’s ongoing work in Alberta uncovering fossil eggshells linked to diverse dinosaur species aligns with the findings about stable dinosaur populations.“The research team uncovered compelling new evidence (…) that dinosaurs were still going strong ‘til the very end,” Zelenitsky wrote in an email.The new study may focus on dinosaurs, but the fact that 75% of species on Earth disappeared at the same time contains a lesson that remains applicable today, Brusatte said.“Sudden climate and environmental change can catch animals and ecosystems unaware,” he said, “and can defeat even the strongest and most iconic of species.”Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

She said she’d offered her resignation to Culture Minister Rachida Dati after the robbery, but it was rejected.Des Cars, who took the role in 2021, said the museum’s weakness lies in the lack of perimeter protection, which she said was a result of “chronic underinvestment in equipment and infrastructure.”The Louvre’s last major renovation was in the 1980s under former French President François Mitterrand, who commissioned Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei to design an entrance befitting the historic venue.The glass pyramid that now forms the entrance to the museum opened to the public in 1989, putting a modern face on a storied institution known for its exhibition of the world’s finest art.Des Cars said that renovation project may have created an illusion of momentum behind the museum being fully modernized. However, she said: “This major modernization project is now 40 years old, with facilities that have outperformed and are at the end of their tether.”The heist unfolded at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday when robbers parked a truck with a mobile ladder outside the gallery. At 9:34 a.m. they triggered an alarm on the second-floor door, which sent a signal to a security post.A security officer inside the auditorium radioed to report an intrusion and staff began evacuating members of the public. Alarms on two high-security display cases were triggered as the thieves cut holes in the glass to grab the jewels.  At 9:36 a.m. police were called. A minute later, a message was broadcast requesting that the doors be closed. By 9.38 a.m. the thieves had left the building.Surveillance teams outside the museum prevented the suspects from setting their vehicle alight but could not prevent their escape on scooters along the banks of the Seine. A law enforcement official said investigators combed the truck for any traces of DNA. One of the two scooters had been retrieved as well as a helmet worn by one of the suspects, the official added.Des Cars said Wednesday the security system inside the Apollo Gallery “worked perfectly” – but that it was designed several years ago to protect against the greatest risks of that time. For example, the high-security display cases that housed the jewels were designed to withstand bullets.“At the time, this was the dominant modus operandi for this type of attack, for precious objects, jewelry, attacks in jewelry stores,” des Cars said. “That’s what the Louvre is protecting itself against.”She said what’s needed now is to adapt the system to a “new type of attack, to new operating methods that had not been envisaged.”The theft had “profoundly shocked” the museum’s staff, French citizens and “all those who love the Louvre,” des Cars said.She suggested measures that could be put in place to enhance the museum’s security, such as fortifying the outer edges of the Louvre and prohibiting cars from parking in the vicinity.  Des Cars said she’s also considering whether it would be possible to install a police station inside the museum.CNN’s John Miller contributed to this report.© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

But those farmers, who overwhelmingly supported the president in the 2024 election, say they aren’t feeling the love right now.Trump is facing criticism from many US cattle ranchers after signaling support for increasing low-tariff beef imports from Argentina to ease record beef prices in the United States. The move comes just weeks after US soybean farmers blasted a separate deal with Argentina that they fear will give South American producers a competitive edge in that market.Argentina currently accounts for just over 2% of US beef imports. Under existing rules, it can ship up to 20,000 metric tons a year at a lower tariff rate, with anything above that subject to a 26.4% tariff, according to the US Department of Agriculture.A White House official told CNN the administration plans to raise that quota to 80,000 metric tons, effectively quadrupling the amount of Argentinian beef with low tariffs that can enter the United States.In an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said: “Currently, Americans consume 12 million metric tons of beef. 10 million, we produce in this country. 2 million, we import. Out of 12 million, [the Argentine quota] would be 20,000 every quarter. This is not a massive influx in the millions of tons I think that some have thought of beef from Argentina.”But Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle farmer and the senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan farm organization, said: “If Trump goes through with what he outlined, I do believe it’s a betrayal of the American rancher. It’s a feeling that you’re selling us out to a foreign competitor.”On Wednesday, Trump reacted to the backlash from cattle ranchers.“The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” Trump wrote on social media.“It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!” he added.In a statement, Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade association for beef producers, said the organization and its members “cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.”The price of beef has climbed significantly this year, up nearly 14% in the past year, according to the latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August. (A fresh read on consumer prices is set to be released Friday.)Becca Jablonski, an agricultural economist who teaches at Cornell University’s Johnson School of Business, said the price increase is fueled by multiple factors.A recent, multi-year drought decreased the amount of grazing land for cattle and made feed grain significantly more expensive, resulting in a shortage of cattle, she said.The shortage has also been made worse by an infestation of New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, just across the border in Mexico, significantly curtailing beef imports from that country.Jablonski said that historically the livestock sector barely makes money, but is having a rare positive year, which allows farmers to pay down debts they accrued during unprofitable years.“I think the argument the industry is making is, ‘Let us have one good year,’” she said.In a statement, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the president is keeping his promises to defend farmers and consumers.“President Trump pledged to protect America’s ranchers and deliver economic relief for everyday Americans. The Administration is accomplishing both by expanding beef imports from Argentina to lower consumer prices in the short term while rolling out a new USDA initiative that will support ranchers and expand cattle herd sizes to keep prices lower in the long term,” Kelly said.Lovell said many of the farmers he knows are just scraping by.Big beef: GOP pushback grows over Trump’s call to buy beef from Argentina“It is not uncommon for folks in farming to have a year where they report a loss,” he said. “You cannot look at cattle producers that had one good year and say, ‘Oh my gosh, they are just making out like bandits.’”Lovell blamed price increases on the large meatpacking corporations that buy product from US ranchers and package it for grocery stores.An influx of imported beef would hurt US farmers, he said, because the large meat packers are not required to label what country their beef comes from.There are some signs that support for Trump in farm country has begun to fray. He won 93% of rural counties in the 2024 election, the highest share of any Republican presidential candidate this century, according to the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan research organization.But soybean farmers were among the first to feel the pain of Trump’s tit-for-tat tariffs with China. Since May, China has effectively boycotted American soybeans as a response to Trump’s tariffs.Even before tariffs, the family farming industry in the United States was already hurting. Since 2017, the country has lost more than 17% of its family farms — at least 100,000 operations — according to the USDA.Tariffs may be exacerbating that pain. Farm bankruptcies rose in the first half of the year to the highest level since 2021, according to US courts data.John Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer and the founder of The National Black Farmers Association, said he had never had a problem selling his soybeans until recently.“Now nobody’s buying it,” Boyd said. “The largest purchaser of our soybeans was China, and they haven’t placed any orders. Zero.”“The president thinks his tariffs are the best thing since sliced bread, and it’s putting America’s farmers out of business,” he added.The administration drew backlash last month after agreeing to provide $20 billion in currency support to help stabilize the Argentine peso, a move critics have characterized as effectively bailing out Argentina.A text message, seen by CNN, sent by Secretary Rollins to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, suggested that Argentina then used that financial lifeline to strike a deal with China on soybeans.“We bailed out Argentina yesterday and in return the Argentine’s (sic) removed their export tariffs on grains, reducing their price to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,” the message said.“Here we are losing our farms, and the president is helping out a foreign country,” Boyd said of the deal.Earlier this month, sources told CNN the White House was planning to extend a multibillion-dollar bailout for farmers. With the government shutdown stretching past its third week, no plan has materialized yet.Although the USDA has been largely shuttered during the government shutdown, the agency on Wednesday announced a plan it said would “strengthen the American beef industry.”The plan includes expanding ranchers’ access to federal land for grazing and prioritizing grant applications from military veterans looking to enter the industry, among other measures.Lovell said that while the plan may be welcome news to many farmers, he felt it didn’t go far enough to protect the industry.“What US ranchers need is a fair market with the right incentives. We’ve got to encourage rebuilding the cow herd here in the US,” he said.  “This seems to be a quick attempt to control the damage.”CNN’s Kit Maher, Alayna Treene and Bryan Mena contributed reporting.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But GLP-1 medications are busting their employers’ budgets, leading some firms to rethink their coverage.The share of very large firms covering these drugs for obesity soared to 43% this year, up from 28% last year, according to KFF’s latest annual Employer Health Benefits Survey, which was released on Wednesday. These employers, who have more than 5,000 workers, are much more likely than their smaller counterparts to offer such a benefit.Among firms with between 200 and 999 staffers, only 16% provide coverage of drugs for weight loss this year, the same as last year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.GLP-1 drugs, which treat diabetes, obesity and certain other conditions, have been in great demand since they came on the market a few years ago because they help patients shed pounds. While employers typically cover the medications for diabetes, fewer of them do so for weight loss, in part because of the drugs’ high prices — which have also limited Americans’ access to them. The list price of Wegovy, for instance, is about $1,350 for a month’s supply, though discounts are available.Employers, however, recognize that covering the medications for weight loss is a valuable benefit to attract and retain talented staffers. Notably, even among firms that don’t do so, nearly half said the benefit is “very important” or “important” for employee satisfaction. More than 36 million people with job-based insurance have a body mass index that would medically qualify them for a GLP-1 drug.“Large employers know these new high-priced weight-loss drugs are an important benefit for their workers, but their costs often exceed their expectations,” Gary Claxton, KFF senior vice president, said in a statement. “It’s not a surprise that some are rethinking access to the drugs for weight loss.”Costs are higher than forecast because more workers are taking advantage of the benefit, KFF found. Nearly 60% of large firms said usage of the medications for weight loss is higher than they predicted, while two-thirds of such employers said the impact on their prescription drug spending was “significant.”One employer KFF surveyed found that it spent more on GLP-1 medications than any other drug this year, up from 32nd place last year.A large retailer told KFF, “Before we knew it, we spent half a million dollars and we’re projected to go up to $1.2 million the following year.”The high costs of GLP-1 drugs have long been a source of frustration for many Americans. President Donald Trump set off a kerfuffle last week when he said that the medications would soon be available for $150, prompting Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, to step in and say negotiations are ongoing.Many employers told KFF they were looking at reducing coverage of the drugs through steps such as limiting eligibility to those with higher body mass indexes or requiring workers to participate in weight management programs.“You have to have a coach, and then you can only stay on it for a certain amount of time before you have to get reevaluated,” one large manufacturer told KFF.Other firms told KFF they have decided to drop the benefit for weight loss.However, employers will likely have to reconsider their coverage again in coming years, especially as more workers demand coverage, and the drugs are approved for even more medical conditions. Plus, prices coming down.“We’re still writing the story of what GLP-1 coverage looks like in employer plans,” said Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF.GLP-1 drug costs – and prescription drug prices in general – are also contributing to a rise in premiums.Annual insurance coverage for a family hit $27,000, on average, this year, up 6% from 2024, according to KFF’s survey. Workers contribute $6,850 toward the cost, on average, while employers pick up the rest of the tab.Meanwhile, individual coverage topped $9,300, on average, this year, up 5% – with employees shouldering $1,440 of the cost and employers paying the rest.Over the past five years, the growth in premiums has been largely in line with inflation and wage increases.But coverage for 2026 could be much pricier, according to several benefits consulting firms. KFF also points to GLP-1 medications, hospital prices and tariffs as factors that could push up premiums and out-of-pocket costs for workers next year.“There is a quiet alarm bell going off,” Drew Altman, KFF’s CEO, said in a statement. “Employers have nothing new in their arsenal that can address most of the drivers of their cost increases, and that could well result in an increase in deductibles and other forms of employee cost sharing again, a strategy that neither employers nor employees like but companies resort to in a pinch to hold down premium increases.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

In Europe, Giorgia Meloni became Italy’s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini in 2022, while the far-right Alternative for Germany is now Germany’s largest opposition party. The Trump administration has endorsed far-right parties in Europe, and in Argentina far-right libertarian Javier Milei won the presidency in 2023.The UN report, unveiled Wednesday, says changes to welfare systems have made it harder to access benefits by tightening eligibility rules or imposing stricter conditions, contributing to the kind of economic precarity and alienation that drives people to the far right.“These punitive welfare systems increase economic insecurity, erode trust in public institutions and leave millions feeling humiliated and abandoned by mainstream politics,” the report’s author, Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said in a press release.“It is in this void that far-right populists thrive, presenting themselves as champions of those left behind by the ‘elite.’”But he warned: “Their agenda is not to empower people in poverty – it is to further dismantle protections for their own gain.”Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act illustrates this type of “populism of the privileged,” the report argues. The package includes historic reductions to America’s safety net programs, particularly Medicaid and food stamps, and at the same time slashes taxes, resulting “in a massive transfer” of resources from the poorest households to the richest.Growing gaps in incomes are a “major factor” explaining the rise of right-wing populism, says the 19-page report, citing several studies, including one that established “an almost perfect correlation” between income inequality and support for populist parties.The report also notes European Social Surveys – tracking public attitudes, beliefs and behavior – which show that there is a 25% chance unemployed people at the lowest levels of jobless benefits will vote for the far right versus 15% for those who are employed.Higher pension levels, better child allowances and minimum wage legislation also have a “statistically measurable impact” in reducing the likelihood of a vote for the far right.“Thousands of people in poverty I speak with tell me they feel stigmatized and monitored rather than supported,” De Schutter said. “Unless social protection is taken seriously as a human right, far-right populists will continue to reap what has been sown.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

If the answer is yes, newly released recommendations may help relieve your symptoms.Kiwifruit, rye bread and high mineral-content water can help alleviate chronic constipation, according to new dietary guidelines copublished October 13 by the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.About 1 out of every 6 to 7 people are affected by chronic constipation worldwide. In the United States, 9% to 20% of adults have some form of chronic idiopathic constipation, in which the cause of the condition is unknown.Some symptoms of chronic constipation include having a bowel movement fewer than three times a week, hard or lumpy stool, or straining or experiencing pain when pooping.How often should you poop? The answer might not be what you thinkThe guidelines “introduce foods and drinks (e.g., kiwifruit, prunes, rye bread, high mineral content water) and specific supplement interventions into clinical guidance, filling a long-standing gap between research and routine clinical advice,” lead study author Dr. Eirini Dimidi said in an email. “That will help clinicians give clearer, more targeted, and evidence-informed dietary advice, and will allow people to self-manage their symptoms more effectively.”The guidance applies to healthy adults with chronic idiopathic constipation and “did not focus on constipation secondary to other conditions (e.g., neurological disease, pregnancy), so while some recommendations may be applicable, they should be used with caution in these groups, as well as in children,” said Dimidi, an associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.The guidelines did not include a general recommendation for increased fiber intake in a patient’s diet. Rather, they focused on specific foods that could be beneficial, Dimidi added.Certain lifestyle choices or situations, such as low fiber intake, dehydration, lack of exercise, or stress, can cause constipation. As a result, clinicians focus most treatment on dietary changes.Previous dietary advice was broad, such as telling patients to eat more fiber. But these new guidelines, Dimidi said, suggest “incorporating evidence-based foods and drinks in your diet, such as consuming 2-3 kiwifruits a day.”Unlike other recommended food such as prunes, kiwifruit is simple to incorporate into your diet.“With kiwifruit, because it’s so well-tolerated, you usually can just step right into that dose, as opposed to prunes, for example, where you want to more gradually work up to that dose of six to eight prunes per day,” said Dr. William Chey, professor and chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. He was not involved in the new research.Kiwis can increase stool bulk and water content, enhance protein digestion, and smoothen the movement of food, fluids and waste in the digestive tract. The small fruits also improve the amount of time it takes for waste to pass through your intestine and have natural prebiotic effects, such as improved digestion and reduced gut inflammation.Kiwis are also palatable and soft, which makes them easy to eat, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the study.You can also eat a kiwi’s skin or peel, which has extra fiber. But avoid heating a kiwi, since high temperatures destroy the enzyme that smoothens gut movement, Choudhary added.Foods such as prunes, rye bread, flaxseeds, oranges, yogurt, beans and oatmeal can also help with chronic constipation.For those who like dairy, you could “take a cup of yogurt, make it 8 ounces, any yogurt of your choice because all yogurts have probiotics, and take a heaped tablespoon full of crushed flaxseeds,” said Choudhary, an expert with the American Gastroenterological Association.Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies. Be part of oneOther alternatives include dietary supplements, such as psyllium, which helps your intestine move stool along and reduces your body’s cholesterol absorption from food.“That dosage is at least 10 grams of fiber per day. And again, the general rule is, start low and go slow. So start with 3 grams and gradually work your way up to 10 plus grams per day of psyllium to achieve the benefits,” said Chey, incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology.Physical activity is also an important lifestyle change that patients with chronic constipation can incorporate.Even something as simple as walking increases the effectiveness of the digestive tract, Choudhary said.The new recommendations were based on findings of four systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at over 75 randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions for chronic constipation.Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.
